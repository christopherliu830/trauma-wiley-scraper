Effects of a yoga breath intervention alone and in combination with an exposure therapy for PTSD and depression in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami. Objective:? This study evaluated the effect of a yoga breath program alone and followed by a trauma reduction exposure technique on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami. Method:? In this non-randomized study, 183 tsunami survivors who scored 50 or above on the Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17) were assigned by camps to one of three groups: yoga breath intervention, yoga breath intervention followed by 3?8?h of trauma reduction exposure technique or 6-week wait list. Measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-17) and depression (BDI-21) were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24?weeks. Data were analyzed using anova and mixed effects regression. Results:? The effect of treatment vs. control was significant at 6?weeks (F2,178?=?279.616, P?<?0.001): mean PCL-17 declined by 42.5?±?10.0 SD with yoga breath, 39.2?±?17.2 with Yoga breath?+?exposure and 4.6?±?13.2 in the control. Conclusion:? Yoga breath-based interventions may help relieve psychological distress following mass disasters.

AB  - Abstract In vivo longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of rodent spinal cord injury (SCI) was carried out over a period of eight weeks post-injury. A balanced, rotationally invariant, alternating gradient polarity icosahedral diffusion encoding scheme was used for an unbiased estimation of the DTI metrics. The fractional anisotropy (FA), diffusivities along (longitudinal), and perpendicular (transverse) to the fiber tracts, were estimated for the ventral, dorsal, and lateral white matter. In all the three regions, the DTI metrics were observed to be significantly different in injured cords relative to the uninjured controls close to the epicenter of the injury. However, these differences gradually disappeared away from the epicenter. The spatio-temporal changes in the DTI metrics showed a recovery pattern that is region specific. Although the temporal trends in the tissue recovery in rostral and caudal sections seem to be similar, overall the DTI metrics were observed to be closer to the normal tissue values in the caudal relative to the rostral sections (rostral?caudal asymmetry). ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections in veterinary hospitals ? with outbreaks of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella among equine cases resulting in high case fatality rates and substantial financial cost. Objectives Study objectives were to 1) investigate factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella enterica and 2) evaluate the effect shedding may have on health outcomes of previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Study design Retrospective case?control study with prospective cohort study. Methods Analysis of medical records (N = 373; 94 culture positive, 279 culture negative) was undertaken to determine factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella. Additionally, a follow-up study was conducted to assess long-term outcomes associated with shedding among previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Data regarding exposures of interest were collected retrospectively from medical records. Information on long-term outcomes was obtained by phone interview of owners. Multivariable regression techniques were used to investigate factors associated with shedding and subsequent health outcomes. Results Horses experiencing diarrhoea during hospitalisation were more likely to shed Salmonella (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.02, 3.45) compared with horses without diarrhoea, but isolates tended to be susceptible strains. Antimicrobial therapy during hospitalisation was not associated with shedding or recovery of MDR strains. Shedding did not increase long-term risk for non-survival, colic or abnormal faeces after hospital discharge; nor increase risk for hospitalisation or occurrence of abnormal faeces in stablemates. Main limitations Data collection was reliant upon the quality of medical records and owner recall, which may have led to information bias. The study population was derived from central Kentucky and may differ from horse populations in other regions. Conclusions and clinical importance In general, Salmonella shedding was not associated with decreased average survival times or impacts to health of stablemates, perhaps due to owner implemented biosecurity precautions. Regardless, recently hospitalised horses should be segregated after discharge, in addition to employing rigorous hygiene practices. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Abstract Prolonged and persistent hypermetabolism and excessive inflammatory response after severe trauma is detrimental and associated with poor outcome. The predisposing pathology or signals mediating this complex response are essentially unknown. As the liver is the central organ mediating the systemic metabolic responses and considering that adult hepatic stem cells are on top of the hierarchy of cell differentiation and may pass epigenetic information to their progeny, we asked whether liver progenitor cells are activated, signal hypermetabolism upon post-traumatic cellular stress responses, and pass this to differentiated progeny. We generated Sox9CreERT2: ROSA26 EYFP mice to lineage-trace the periportal ductal progenitor cells (PDPCs) and verify the fate of these cells post-burn. We observed increased proliferation of PDPCs and their progeny peaking around two weeks post-burn, concomitant with the hepatomegaly and the cellular stress responses. We then sorted out PDPCs, PDPC-derived hepatocytes and mature hepatocytes, compared their transcriptome and showed that PDPCs and their progeny present a significant up-regulation in signalling pathways associated with inflammation and metabolic activation, contributing to persistent hypermetabolic and hyper-inflammatory state. Furthermore, concomitant down-regulation of LXR signalling in PDPCs and their progeny implicates the therapeutic potential of early and short-term administration of LXR agonists in ameliorating such persistent hypermetabolism.

AB  - Abstract In this article, both sodium magnetic resonance (MR) and T1? relaxation mapping aimed at measuring molecular changes in cartilage for the diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis are reviewed. First, an introduction to structure of cartilage, its degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA) and an outline of diagnostic imaging methods in quantifying molecular changes and early diagnostic aspects of cartilage degeneration are described. The sodium MRI section begins with a brief overview of the theory of sodium NMR of biological tissues and is followed by a section on multiple quantum filters that can be used to quantify both bi-exponential relaxation and residual quadrupolar interaction. Specifically, (i) the rationale behind the use of sodium MRI in quantifying proteoglycan (PG) changes, (ii) validation studies using biochemical assays, (iii) studies on human OA specimens, (iv) results on animal models and (v) clinical imaging protocols are reviewed. Results demonstrating the feasibility of quantifying PG in OA patients and comparison with that in healthy subjects are also presented. The section concludes with the discussion of advantages and potential issues with sodium MRI and the impact of new technological advancements (e.g. ultra-high field scanners and parallel imaging methods). In the theory section on T1?, a brief description of (i) principles of measuring T1? relaxation, (ii) pulse sequences for computing T1? relaxation maps, (iii) issues regarding radio frequency power deposition, (iv) mechanisms that contribute to T1? in biological tissues and (v) effects of exchange and dipolar interaction on T1? dispersion are discussed. Correlation of T1? relaxation rate with macromolecular content and biomechanical properties in cartilage specimens subjected to trypsin and cytokine-induced glycosaminoglycan depletion and validation against biochemical assay and histopathology are presented. Experimental T1? data from osteoarthritic specimens, animal models, healthy human subjects and as well from osteoarthritic patients are provided. The current status of T1? relaxation mapping of cartilage and future directions is also discussed. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with a reference standard, arthroscopic and/or open surgery, in dogs with soft tissue shoulder pathology. Study Design? Retrospective study. Animals? Dogs (n=21). Methods? Magnetic resonance (MR) images were retrospectively evaluated in 21 dogs that had surgically identified soft tissue shoulder pathology. The musculotendinous units of the biceps, infraspinatus, teres minor, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and the medial and lateral glenohumeral ligaments (MGHL and LGHL) were graded as either normal or abnormal. Abnormal structures were further classified as being either inflamed, partially torn, or fully torn. Impingement of the biceps tendon was also evaluated. Results were reported in terms of agreement and concordance between MRI findings and surgical findings. Agreement was defined as the percentage of times MRI findings concurred with surgical findings with respect to a structure being either normal or abnormal. Concordance was defined as the percentage of times MRI concurred with the exact surgically assessed pathology when abnormality was identified. Results? The findings were biceps tendon: 90% agreement with 100% concordance; subscapularis: 95% agreement with 62% concordance; MGHL: 84% agreement with 83% concordance; LGHL: 88% agreement with 100% concordance; infraspinatus: 100% both agreement and concordance; biceps tendon impingement: 90% agreement with 100% concordance. Conclusions? Soft tissue abnormalities of the canine shoulder were readily identified on preoperative MR images. Clinical Relevance? MRI shows great potential as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of canine shoulder disease.

AB  - Abstract Quantitative sodium magnetic resonance imaging permits noninvasive measurement of the tissue sodium concentration (TSC) bioscale in the brain. Computing the TSC bioscale requires reconstructing and combining multiple datasets acquired with a non-Cartesian acquisition that highly oversamples the center of k-space. Even with an optimized implementation of the algorithm to compute TSC, the overall processing time exceeds the time required to collect data from the human subject. Such a mismatch presents a challenge for sustained sodium imaging to avoid a growing data backlog and provide timely results. The most computationally intensive portions of the TSC calculation have been identified and accelerated using a consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) in addition to a conventional central processing unit (CPU). A recently developed data organization technique called Compact Binning was used along with several existing algorithmic techniques to maximize the scalability and performance of these computationally intensive operations. The resulting GPU+CPU TSC bioscale calculation is more than 15 times faster than a CPU-only implementation when processing 256 ? 256 ? 256 data and 2.4 times faster when processing 128 ? 128 ? 128 data. This eliminates the possibility of a data backlog for quantitative sodium imaging. The accelerated quantification technique is suitable for general three-dimensional non-Cartesian acquisitions and may enable more sophisticated imaging techniques that acquire even more data to be used for quantitative sodium imaging. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer from a failure of cognitive control over emotional distracters. The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - Abstract Objective Language skills continue to develop rapidly in children during the school-age years, and the ?snapshot? view of the neural substrates of language provided by current neuroimaging studies cannot capture the dynamic changes associated with brain development. The aim of this study was to conduct a 5-year longitudinal investigation of language development using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy children. Methods Thirty subjects enrolled at ages 5, 6, or 7 were examined annually for 5 years using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner and a verb generation task. Data analysis was conducted based on a general linear model that was modified to investigate developmental changes whereas minimizing the potential for missing data. Results With increasing age, there is progressive participation in language processing by the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, and angular gyri of the left hemisphere and the lingual and inferior temporal gyri of the right hemisphere and regression of participation of the left posterior insula/extrastriate cortex, left superior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, and left thalamus. Conclusion The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence of increased neuroplasticity of language in this age group and may have implications for further investigations of normal and aberrant language development.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study looked to investigate a new quantitative metric, R2???R1? (1/T2???1/T1?), using magnetic resonance (MR) images and voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) for detecting early cartilage degeneration and explore the association with patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Sixty-four patients from three sites were bilaterally scanned on a 3T MR with a combined T1?/T2 protocol to calculate R1? (1/T1?) and R2 (1/T2) values at baseline and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Non-rigid registration was applied to align images onto a template, allowing VBR to determine VBR rate differences and explore cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between injured and uninjured knees, generating Statistical Parametric Maps (SPMs). Baseline R2???R1? differences were further correlated with change in PROMs from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from baseline to 6 months. Cross-sectional results demonstrated low relaxation rate differences in the injured patella (baseline: 21%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 18%, p?=?0.02), lateral tibia (baseline: 25%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 24%, p?=?0.01), and weight-bearing regions of the tibia and femur. The uninjured patella showed significant longitudinal changes (17%, p?=?0.02). R2???R1? differences showed significant correlations with KOOS PROMs, particularly in the lateral tibia, patella, and trochlea. R2???R1? difference VBR analyses provide new and highly sensitive parameters for assessing early cartilage degeneration in patients after ACL injury by integrating findings from both T1? and T2, commonly used relaxation time parameters, into a single metric. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Superior semicircular canal dehiscence is a newly described syndrome of sound and / or pressure induced vertigo. Computed tomography (CT) imaging plays an important role in confirmation of a defect in the bone overlying the canal. A high resolution CT technique utilising 0.5 mm or thinner slices and multi-planar reconstructions parallel to the superior semicircular canal is required. Placement of a histogram over a suspected defect can assist CT diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Surgical treatment of traumatic abdominal hernias is usually delayed for 2?3 months following injury. The residual defects are then repaired by herniorrhaphy or mesh herniorrhaphy. Objective To describe the outcome following herniorrhaphy (without a mesh) within 21 days of initial injury to repair external traumatic lateral abdominal hernias in horses and mules. Study design Descriptive case series. Methods Twenty-two cases were included. Surgical treatment involved exposure of the hernia sac and closing of the abdominal wall defect with interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate sutures after reduction of the herniated organ into the peritoneal cavity. Data collected included cause and site of the hernia, surgical findings, immediate and long-term post operative complications, return to use, duration of convalescence and hernia recurrence. Results Falling while crossing impassable pathways was the most common initial cause of the hernia (9/11 horses and 10/11 mules). Adhesion formation to underlying viscera was found intraoperatively in 2 cases. Uncomplicated healing occurred in all animals except 3 with suture abscesses and one with a subcutaneous seroma. At the time of follow-up (6?24 months after surgery), complete recovery without recurrence of herniation was achieved and animals had returned to their previous use. Conclusion Herniorrhaphy within 21 days using interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate pattern sutures can be effective for treating external traumatic abdominal hernias in horses and mules.
