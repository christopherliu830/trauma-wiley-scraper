AB  - ABSTRACT This study looked to investigate a new quantitative metric, R2???R1? (1/T2???1/T1?), using magnetic resonance (MR) images and voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) for detecting early cartilage degeneration and explore the association with patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Sixty-four patients from three sites were bilaterally scanned on a 3T MR with a combined T1?/T2 protocol to calculate R1? (1/T1?) and R2 (1/T2) values at baseline and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Non-rigid registration was applied to align images onto a template, allowing VBR to determine VBR rate differences and explore cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between injured and uninjured knees, generating Statistical Parametric Maps (SPMs). Baseline R2???R1? differences were further correlated with change in PROMs from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from baseline to 6 months. Cross-sectional results demonstrated low relaxation rate differences in the injured patella (baseline: 21%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 18%, p?=?0.02), lateral tibia (baseline: 25%, p?=?0.01; 6-months: 24%, p?=?0.01), and weight-bearing regions of the tibia and femur. The uninjured patella showed significant longitudinal changes (17%, p?=?0.02). R2???R1? differences showed significant correlations with KOOS PROMs, particularly in the lateral tibia, patella, and trochlea. R2???R1? difference VBR analyses provide new and highly sensitive parameters for assessing early cartilage degeneration in patients after ACL injury by integrating findings from both T1? and T2, commonly used relaxation time parameters, into a single metric. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10?years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-? peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd* confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood?brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90?min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3?h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used to evaluate the distal aspect of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of lame horses. There is paucity of information comparing interobserver agreement of this imaging modality. Objectives To determine the interobserver agreement for assessment of the DDFT on sMRI using a newly developed grading system. It was hypothesised that different lesion types would be more frequently observed at different anatomical locations of the DDFT, and that interobserver agreement would be better for the presence of a lesion compared to lesion grading. Study design A retrospective study assessing interobserver agreement. Methods sMRI studies of 40 equine front feet were retrospectively graded by 2 observer teams using a newly developed grading system based on previous studies. Individual DDFT parameters and an overall DDFT grade were scored. A Pearson's Chi-square test quantified the association between anatomical location and lesion type and interobserver agreement was quantified by calculating weighted-kappa statistic. Results Observer team B found a statistically significant association between anatomical location and lesion type but observer team A did not. Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the majority of individual DDFT parameters. For most parameters, better interobserver agreement was found for presence of a lesion than for lesion grading. Interobserver agreement was fair for the overall DDFT grade. Conclusions Interobserver agreement was acceptable for overall DDFT grade and was better for the presence of an overall grade. Interobserver agreement was also acceptable for most DDFT parameters and was better for assessing whether a lesion was present compared to the grading of lesions. This study highlights the value of a standardised grading system for assessing the DDFT on sMRI, and provides a method to improve the repeatibilty and reliability of future studies using sMRI.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? There is a paucity of literature regarding the clinical profile of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in children. The aims of this retrospective study were to determine the etiology and clinical presentation, and to present our experience in diagnosing CP in children in China. Methods:? Clinical data of children who were treated for CP at Changhai Hospital from January 1997 to August 2006 were reviewed. Results:? A total of 427 CP patients presented to our center. There were 42 (9.8%) children with CP, including 21 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 11.7?years at the first onset. The main etiological factor was idiopathic (73.8%). Of the patients, 78.5% had episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain and 54.8% had multiple (≥?4) episodes. The mean duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis was 41.6?months and a definite diagnosis was not made until 2?years later in 57.1% of these patients. The positive rates of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for detecting ductal changes and intraductal stones or pancreatic calcification were 51.4% and 45.4%, 71.4% and 87.5%, 80.0% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusion:? The main etiological factor of Chinese children with CP is idiopathic. The main symptom in these patients is multiple episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which often lead to a delay in the definite diagnosis. CT and MRCP (or MRI) should be used as the first investigation in the evaluation of these cases.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Abstract Early life trauma is a risk factor for life-long disorders related to emotional processing, but knowledge underlying its enduring effect is incomplete. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that early life trauma increases amygdala-dependent threat responses via reduction in inhibition by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNN) supporting PV cells, thus increasing excitability of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). From postnatal day (PN) 8?12, rat pups of both sexes were reared under normal bedding or under insufficient nest-building materials to induce maternal-to-infant maltreatment trauma (Scarcity-Adversity Model, SAM). At weaning age of PN23, the SAM group exhibited increased threat responses to predator odor. The SAM-induced increase in threat response was recapitulated in normally reared PN22?23 rats that were unilaterally depleted of PNN in the BLA by the enzymes, chondroitinase-ABC plus hyaluronidase at PN19?20. Light and electron microscopic analysis of the BLA revealed that anterior-to-mid levels of SAM group's BLAs exhibited decreased PNN intensity and decreased axo-somatic synapses between PV-to-principal pyramidal-like neurons and PV-to-PV. PV and PNN densities (cells/mm2) in the BLA of both control (CON) and SAM groups were still low at PN12 and SAM delayed the ontogenetic rise of PV intensity and PNN density. Moreover, PV cell density in the anterior-to-mid BLA correlated negatively with threat response of CON animals, but not for SAM animals. Thus, reduction of PNN-supported, PV-mediated somatic inhibition of pyramidal cells provides a mechanistic support for the enduring effect of early life maltreatment manifested as increasing innate threat response at weaning.

AB  - Abstract The aims of the present study were to clarify the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the aging brain, and to relate the MRI findings to higher order cortical function. A total of 118 healthy aged volunteers (41 men, 77 women) underwent cranial MRI electroencephalography (EEG), Benton visual retention test (BVRT) and interview. The subjects had no past history or clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disorder, head trauma or dementia and were living at home without any difficulty. The majority of the subjects have participated in this series of studies since 1982. Using a 1.5 T superconductive MR instrument, T1-weighted, proton density and T2-weighted images were obtained. The MRI data were rated visually by regarding 12 items according to fixed criteria. T2 high signal intensity (T2HSI) lesions were found in 69.5% of subjects, the prevalence of which increased with age. T2HSI lesions were most frequently found in the basal ganglia (61.9%), followed by the thalamus (39.0%), parietal lobe (37.0%), temporal lobe (12.7%) and pons (8.5%). Among these lesions, lacunar infarction showed low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and was found in 24.6% of subjects, the prevalence also increasing with age. These findings, including brain atrophy determined according to similar criteria, were correlated closely with the subjects' age. The results of BVRT showed a close relation with T2HSI, suggesting that T2HSI may influence cognitive function. When the subjects were classified according to the presence of T2HSI, lacunar infarction and EEG abnormalities, brain atrophy was significantly milder in a group of subjects with T2HSI(-), lacunar infarction(-) and normal EEG than in the other groups. This suggests that changes seemingly representing physiological aging may be promoted by another pathological which also exerts influences on higher order cerebral function.

AB  - Abstract The 2006 Lebanon War exposed children in the north of Israel to daily rocket attacks. To cope with the massive psychological needs, a teacher-delivered protocol focusing on enhancing personal resilience was implemented. Children were assessed for risk factors, symptoms, and adaptation before the 16-week program (Time 1; n = 983) and after its completion (Time 2; n = 563). At a 3-month follow-up (Time 3; n = 754) children were assessed together with a waiting-list comparison group (n = 1,152). Participating children showed a significant symptom decrease at Time 2 and significantly fewer symptoms than the control group at Time 3. Six or more risk factors were associated with greater symptoms and parental concern about the child's adaptive functioning. Teachers are valuable cost-effective providers for clinically informed interventions after mass trauma and disaster.

AB  - Abstract Aging is characterized by accumulation of structural and metabolic changes in the brain. Recent studies suggest transmodal brain networks are especially sensitive to aging, which, we hypothesize, may be due to their apical position in the cortical hierarchy. Studying an open-access healthy cohort (n = 102, age range = 30?89?years) with MRI and A? PET data, we estimated age-related cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and A? deposition. In addition to carrying out surface-based morphological and metabolic mapping experiments, we stratified effects along neocortical and hippocampal resting-state functional connectome gradients derived from independent datasets. The cortical gradient depicts an axis of functional differentiation from sensory-motor regions to transmodal regions, whereas the hippocampal gradient recapitulates its long-axis. While age-related thinning and increased A? deposition occurred across the entire cortical topography, increased A? deposition was especially pronounced toward higher-order transmodal regions. Age-related atrophy was greater toward the posterior end of the hippocampal long-axis. No significant effect of age on A? deposition in the hippocampus was observed. Imaging markers correlated with behavioral measures of fluid intelligence and episodic memory in a topography-specific manner, confirmed using both univariate as well as multivariate analyses. Our results strengthen existing evidence of structural and metabolic change in the aging brain and support the use of connectivity gradients as a compact framework to analyze and conceptualize brain-based biomarkers of aging.

AB  - Background/purpose: Epidermal injury is common but the accuracy of visual methods is significantly impacted by the inherent skin pigmentation. We examined imaging and fluorescence techniques to quantify tissue injury as a function of skin color. Methods: Epidermal and mucosal scratches were created in 20 light- (L* 68.2±2.3) and 20 dark-skinned (L* 46.4±5.2) females. Injured and uninjured sites were treated with toluidine blue (TB), fluorescein (FL) and a TB/FL mixture and photographed under conditions of white and fluorescent light. Area and intensity parameters were determined. Results: Injured sites with TB and TB/FL had higher areas than the control for both light and dark subjects (anova, P<0.05). The intensity of the injured TB site was higher than the control for light skin only. The areas of injured sites with FL and TB/FL were higher than the control for both groups as were the intensities of the injured sites with FL. The findings were similar for the lip skin. Conclusions: Application of TB and FL contrasts under white and fluorescent light can be used to quantify tissue injuries for L* values >35 and is a promising approach for the quantitation across a range of skin pigmentation.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: The central importance of emotions in eating disorders, and these emotions can operate over a number of cognitive levels of processing.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury can cause extensive damage to the white matter (WM) of the brain. These disruptions can be especially damaging in children, whose brains are still maturing. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most commonly used method to assess WM organization, but it has limited resolution to differentiate causes of WM disruption. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields spectra showing the levels of neurometabolites that can indicate neuronal/axonal health, inflammation, membrane proliferation/turnover, and other cellular processes that are on-going post-injury. Previous analyses on this dataset revealed a significant division within the msTBI patient group, based on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT); one subgroup of patients (TBI-normal) showed evidence of recovery over time, while the other showed continuing degeneration (TBI-slow). We combined dMRI with MRS to better understand WM disruptions in children with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). Tracts with poorer WM organization, as shown by lower FA and higher MD and RD, also showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal and axonal health and myelination. We did not find lower NAA in tracts with normal WM organization. Choline, a marker of inflammation, membrane turnover, or gliosis, did not show such associations. We further show that multi-modal imaging can improve outcome prediction over a single modality, as well as over earlier cognitive function measures. Our results suggest that demyelination plays an important role in WM disruption post-injury in a subgroup of msTBI children and indicate the utility of multi-modal imaging.

AB  - Objective To describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthroscopic, and histopathologic changes in dogs with medial coronoid disease and to identify potential relationships between these findings. Study Design Retrospective case series. Sample Population Twenty-five diseased medial coronoid processes (MCP) were collected from 19 dogs with a confirmed diagnosis of medial coronoid disease that were surgically treated by subtotal coronoid ostectomy. A reference group of normal MCP was collected from 9 dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to elbow disease. Methods MCP specimens were evaluated by MRI using a novel grading scheme (all dogs), arthroscopy using a modified Outerbridge scheme (affected dogs only) and histopathology (all dogs). Results The common histopathologic findings were subchondral microfractures, subchondral microfractures continuous with cartilaginous fissures, moderate to severe hypercellularity of the marrow space, trabecular bone necrosis, and articular cartilage degeneration. The severity of cartilage disease in the MCP was moderate to severe in most specimens, even in cases with minimal arthroscopic pathology. Three distinct patterns of bone marrow lesion (BML) were identified adjacent to the MCP, but there was no correlation between BML pattern and either histopathologic or arthroscopic findings. There was moderate correlation between modified Outerbridge scores and MRI scores. No correlation was identified between the histopathologic changes and either MRI or arthroscopic scores. Conclusion There was no significant correlation between the clinical scores and histopathologic changes. Ongoing improvements in the resolution of noninvasive imaging techniques will likely improve description and understanding of the MCP disease in dogs.

AB  - Case We investigated the usefulness of multidetector computed tomography during examination in the emergency department to detect the location of press-through packages that had been inadvertently swallowed. In three patients, four press-through packages were detected on multi-planar reconstruction of multidetector computed tomography images, with three lodged in the esophagus and one in the stomach. Outcome The multidetector computed tomography detection rate of press-through packages was 100% in patients who realized they had swallowed the packages by mistake. After diagnosis, press-through packages in the esophagus were immediately removed endoscopically. Conclusion There are few reports on the usefulness of multi-planar reconstruction images by multidetector computed tomography during examinations in the emergency department for the diagnosis of foreign bodies in patients who have mistakenly swallowed press-through packages. Detecting the location of the packages provided useful information regarding the strategy for their removal. Therefore, proactive multidetector computed tomography use in the emergency department could be beneficial for patients who have inadvertently swallowed press-through packages.

AB  - Abstract Scientific applications like neuroscience data analysis are usually compute and data-intensive. With the use of the additional capacity offered by distributed resources and suitable middlewares, we can achieve much shorter execution time, distribute compute and storage load, and add greater flexibility to the execution of these scientific applications than we could ever achieve in a single compute resource. In this paper, we present the processing of image registration (IR) for functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on Global Grids. We characterize the application, list its requirements and then transform it to a workflow. We use Gridbus Broker and Gridbus Workflow Engine technologies for executing the neuroscience application on the Grid. We developed a complete web-based portal integrating GUI-based workflow editor, execution management, monitoring and visualization of tasks and resources. We describe each component of the system in detail. We then execute the application on Grid'5000 platform and present extensive performance results. We show that the IR application can have (1) significantly improved makespan, (2) distribution of compute and storage load among resources used, and (3) flexibility when executing multiple times on Grid resources.

AB  - Abstract Conventional radiographs used for the management of endodontic problems yield limited information because of the two-dimensional nature of images produced, geometric distortion and anatomical noise. These factors often act in combination. This review paper assesses the limitations of periapical radiographs and seeks to clarify three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been suggested as adjuncts to conventional radiographs. These include tuned aperture computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computed tomography and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Of these techniques, CBCT appears to be an effective and safe way to overcome some of the problems associated with conventional radiographs.

AB  - Objective:? The use of brain imaging in psychiatry still lacks clear guidelines. We investigated the referral practice, outcome and predictive factors of neuroimaging in a Swiss psychiatric university clinic. Method:? Medical files were reviewed retrospectively for 435 consecutively hospitalized patients who were subjected to neuroimaging. The association between the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and the scan results was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results:? Of overall examinations, 69.4% were normal, 16.3% equivocal and 14.3% abnormal; 2.9% of scans ordered for screening only showed pathology. Neurologic signs and advanced age of patients predicted abnormal scan findings, whereas other variables such as EEG results showed no significant association. Conclusion:? Our results support the need for clear indications for using brain imaging in psychiatric in-patients. Focal neurologic signs and advanced patient age seems to predict abnormal scan results. However, these criteria are not sufficiently sensitive to predict significant scan findings in all patients.

AB  - Objective: To describe the patterns of enhancement of extradural intervertebral disc on chemically fat saturated gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images and to investigate the clinical and pathological associations with enhancement. Methods: Medical records and magnetic resonance images were reviewed from 30 dogs with histopathologically confirmed disc disease and enhancement on a T1-weighted postcontrast fat saturated sequence. Results: Median duration of neurological signs was 4 days and the most common grade of severity was II, seen in 46·6% of dogs. Homogeneous, heterogeneous and peripheral patterns of disc enhancement were described, with peripheral enhancement most commonly identified (57% of dogs). There were no clinical or pathological differences between the dogs with each of the patterns. The mean signal intensity of a region of interest within the extruded disc material and contrast-to-noise ratio of the disc material were significantly higher on postcontrast T1-weighted fat saturated images (P=<0·0001 each). Clinical Significance: The use of fat saturated gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can detect enhancement of extradural disc material. Patterns of enhancement are not associated with the clinical presentation or pathological features.
