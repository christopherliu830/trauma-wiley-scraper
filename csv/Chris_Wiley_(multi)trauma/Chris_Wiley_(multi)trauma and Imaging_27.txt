AB  - In order to develop a superior bone imaging agent, a new radiotracer 99mTc-1-hydroxy-5-(2-butyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)pentane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (BIPeDP) was designed and prepared with good radiochemical yield and stability. The biodistribution in mice shows that 99mTc-BIPeDP has high specificity in the skeleton with the maximum uptake of 17.30?±?0.14 injected dose per gram at 60?min. Kinetics of blood clearance shows that the distribution half-life (T1/2α) and elimination half-life (T1/2?) of 99mTc-BIPeDP are 3.7 and 49.7?min, respectively. An excellent image can be obtained at 1-h post-injection with the single photon emission computed tomography bone scanning, which is clearer and quicker than 99mTc-zoledronic acid, 99mTc-1-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)pentane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid, and 99mTc-methylenediphosphonic acid All results indicate that 99mTc-BIPeDP holds great potential as a novel promising bone imaging agent.

AB  - Abstract It is well established that manganese ion (Mn2+) can access neurons through voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels. Based upon this fundamental principle, Mn2+ has long been used in biomedical research as an indicator of Ca2+ influx in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy. Additionally, after entry into neurons, Mn2+ is transported down axons via microtubule based fast axonal transport. Furthermore, Mn2+ is paramagnetic, resulting in a shortening of the spin-lattice relaxation time-constant, T1, which yields positive contrast enhancement in T1-weighted MRI images, specific to tissues where the ion has accumulated. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) utilizes a combination of these properties of Mn2+ to trace neuronal pathways in an MRI-detectable manner. The focus of this review will detail some of the current MEMRI tract-tracing methodologies in mice and non-human primates as well as biological applications of MEMRI tract-tracing.

Their in vitro and in vivo biological properties were investigated and compared. All radiotracers evaluated in mice showed substantial retention in bone (8.42?±?0.53, 9.08?±?0.65, and 10.3?±?0.61 ID%/g, respectively) at 1?h post-injection and had rapid clearance in blood (1.9484, 1.3666, and 0.7704 ID%/g/min, respectively). 99mTc-PIBDP has the highest uptake ratio of bone-to-soft tissue at 1?h post-injection among the three radiotracers. The results indicate that 99mTc-PIBDP is the most promising bone imaging agent. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Communities with major recreational attractions tend to be rural and to have high injury experience both because of environmental hazards unique to rural areas and because they attract urban visitors who may be unfamiliar with the area andits roads, engaging in activities for which they are poorly prepared, and using equipment that is rented, in poor condition, or even of inherently hazardous design or construction. Alcohol abuse by visitors is often aproblem. Once injured, visitors may have difficulty gaining access to emergency care andwhen received, such care may be limited in both quantity and quality. While the influx of visitors to rural areas brings jobs and income, it also may bring crowding, violence, unintentional injury and other stresses. Most rural recreational communities do not actively plan as a community to deal with these problems, but rather approach them piecemeal and with limited communication among all necessary participants. Such planning is essential if progress is to be made.

AB  - Summary Numerous structural MRI studies have shown that there is a gross neuroanatomy of schizophrenia, which is most evident in the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe, and detectable to some extent in relatives and other high-risk subjects, although it is of unclear relation to features of the disorder. Proton MRS has also demonstrated NAA reductions in these same regions in patients with schizophrenia and different abnormalities in affective disorder. Methods for DT-MRI studies are evolving rapidly but there are replicated accounts of anatomical disconnectivity in several fronto-temporal and other white matter tracts. The principal challenges now are to identify the time course and causes of these structural imaging phenotypes. The relative contributions of specific genetic and environmental risk factors, putative pathophysiological processes and the effects of illness, including medication effects, need to be clarified. Meeting these challenges will be facilitated by methodological advances, including increased resolution and multimodal imaging, but will also require large, detailed, longitudinal, and multicenter studies.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Abstract Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to anisotropic diffusion within bundles of nerve axons and can be used to make objective measurements of brain networks. Many brain disorders are now recognised as being caused by network dysfunction or are secondarily associated with changes in networks. There is therefore great potential in using dMRI measures that reflect network integrity as a future clinical tool to help manage these conditions. Here, we used dMRI to identify replicable, robust and objective markers that meaningfully reflect cognitive and emotional performance. Using diffusion kurtosis analysis and a battery of cognitive and emotional tests, we demonstrated strong relationships between white matter structure across networks of anatomically and functionally specific brain regions with both emotional bias and emotional memory performance in a large healthy cohort. When the connectivity of these regions was examined using diffusion tractography, the terminations of the identified tracts overlapped precisely with cortical loci relating to these domains, drawn from an independent spatial meta-analysis of available functional neuroimaging literature. The association with emotional bias was then replicated using an independently acquired healthy cohort drawn from the Human Connectome Project. These results demonstrate that, even in healthy individuals, white matter dMRI structural features underpin important cognitive and emotional functions. Our robust cross-correlation and replication supports the potential of structural brain biomarkers from diffusion kurtosis MRI to characterise early neurological changes and risk in individuals with a reduced threshold for cognitive dysfunction, with further testing required to demonstrate clinical utility.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of the study were (1) to report the incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in a normal French cavalier King Charles spaniel breeding population; (2) to precise the standard computed tomography dimensions of the caudal fossa and (3) to investigate the use of ultrasonography in diagnosis of this syndrome. Methods: Clinically normal adult cavalier King Charles spaniel underwent ultrasonographic examination of the spinal cord and caudal fossa. Computed tomography was used to measure the caudal fossa and magnetic resonance imaging allowed syringomyelia and cerebellar herniation identification. Results: Of the 16 dogs in the study, seven had syringomyelia (43·7 per cent). All dogs had cerebellar herniation, suggesting Chiari-like malformation and also a tendency to occipital dysplasia. Computed tomography measurements of the caudal fossa are reported. In one dog, a syrinx was identified by ultrasonography. The only difference between dogs with or without syringomyelia was that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia were statistically older. Clinical Significance: The incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia may be high in an asymptomatic population of cavalier King Charles spaniel . Computed tomography measurements reported in this study should now be compared with those of a symptomatic population to evaluate the hypothesis that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia syndrome have a smaller caudal fossa. This study did not identify a smaller caudal fossa in an asymptomatic cavalier King Charles spaniel population with syringomyelia. Ultrasonography probably has a low sensitivity for diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia.

AB  - Purpose Healing, regeneration, and remodeling of the injured Achilles tendon are associated with notable changes in tendon architecture. However, assessing Achilles microstructural properties with conventional diffusion tension imaging (DTI) remains a challenge because of very short T2/ values of the tendon. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a novel Achilles tendon DTI protocol for a non-invasive investigation of the changes of microstructural integrity in tendinopathy. Methods A novel stimulated echo readout-segmented EPI (ste-RS-EPI) DTI sequence was proposed to achieve a TE of ?14?20 ms for typical b-values of 400?800 s/mm2 on clinical 3T MRI scanners. To further boost tendon MR signal, the Achilles was positioned at the magic angle (?55?°) with respect to the scanner B0 field. The sensitivity of the developed protocol was evaluated in 19 healthy participants and 6 patients with clinically confirmed tendinopathy. Results Compared to spin echo RS-EPI DTI protocol, ste-RS-EPI provided an ?100?200% increase in Achilles MR signal. Tendinopathic Achilles demonstrated a high degree of microstructural disruption based on DTI tractography analysis, with significantly lower (P?<?0.05) axial diffusivity (1.20?±?0.19 vs. 1.39?±?0.10???10?3 mm2/s), radial diffusivity (0.72?±?0.11 vs. 0.81?±?0.08???10?3 mm2/s), and mean diffusivity (0.87?±?0.14 vs. 1.00?±?0.07???10?3 mm2/s), but no significant difference in fractional anisotropy (0.38?±?0.04 vs. 0.38?±?0.05; P?=?0.86). Conclusion Achilles tendon ste-RS-EPI DTI can non-invasively detect the tendinopathy-induced changes to microstructural integrity, consistent with the disruption of collagen arrangement and increased cellularity. This study demonstrated the robustness and sensitivity of the proposed protocol in Achilles tendinopathy.

AB  - Developing ways to manage terrorism effectively requires a better understanding of how the public perceives this threat. In the present study, Canadians' perceptions of terrorism risk and 4 other hazards were assessed using a word-association technique and rating scales reflecting key cognitive dimensions of risk (threat, uncertainty, control) and worry reactions. Data were collected in a national telephone survey. Canadians perceived terrorism as posing a lower threat, as more uncertain, and as less controllable, compared to the other hazards. Positive associations of perceived threat and of perceived uncertainty with worry about terrorism were observed. However, perceived control was unexpectedly positively associated with worry about terrorism. The findings also suggest that additional social contextual factors should be examined in future research.

AB  - Abstract The diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is directly related to the ability to interpret differences between significant pathology and normal anatomical variations. A multidisciplinary investigation of the cranio-vertebral articulation with CT, MRI, anatomical dissections and sections, 3D reconstruction, and injections of contrast into the joint spaces has demonstrated some of the anatomical structures which can cause differences in CT and MR images. Some of the factors which can contribute to variations observed in clinical imaging include the supraodontoid bursa with varying amounts of fat or containing a Bergmann's ossicle, fat pads related to the transverse ligament or laxity of the ligament, identification of the ossiculum terminale or of the synostosis at the base of the dens, and flow patterns in the vertebral plexus of veins.

AB  - Summary Digital radiography is the most common advanced dental technology that patients experience during diagnostic visits. The earliest uses of the computer in dentistry were in the business office and accounting. This chapter includes the discussion of some basic oral radiology terms, both conventional and digital. There are several principles of radiation safety: As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), justification, limitation, optimization, and the use of selection criteria. The chapter reviews these and then discusses how digital radiography plays a vital role in the improved safety of modern radiography. Dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is arguably the most exciting advancement in oral radiology since panoramic radiology in the 1950s and1960s and perhaps since Roentgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895. Low dose CBCT protocols can potentially bring the radiation dose of CBCT into the realm of panoramic imaging.

AB  - Purpose: The pathophysiology and clinical phenomenology of epileptic psychoses are wide and varied, and an internationally accepted classification system has yet to be established. A multi-axial classification should be developed to capture the complexity of clinicai situations and to describe the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis. We propose a new 5-axial classification system based on a review of the previous literature and evaluate its validity and applicability in Japan by a multi-institutional design. Methods: According to the ICD-10 guidelines, psychosis is defined as the presence of hallucination, delusions, or a limited number of behavioral abnormalities, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behavior, without disturbance of consciousness. Among the patients with epilepsy and psy- choses treated by the authors at 6 epilepsy clinics, 128 patients were randomly selected to participate as subjects. Those patients who developed epilepsy after the onset of their psychoses were excluded. The average age of the subjects was 39.4 years, average age of onset of epilepsy was 13.3 years, and average age of onset of psychoses was 27.9 years. Results: The first axis codes the type of epilepsy and laterality of epileptic focus. Temporal lobe epilepsy (48%) and other localization-related epilepsies (14%) were prevalent, but all types of epilepsy were seen. Left-sided (29%) and right-sided foci (27%) were in equal proportion, and bilateral foci (9%) also were found. The second axis codes the type of psychoses and clinical course. Paranoid schizophrenia-like disorder (41%) and delusional disorder (19%) were prevalent; whereas acute transient psychotic disorder (9%), catatonic disorder (7%), hallucinosis (6%), and hebephrenic schizophrenia-like disorder (4%) were relatively infrequent. Single episode (24%), recurrent episodes (34%), and chronic course (34%) were found in almost equal proportion. Therc were several cases with chronic course after recurrent episodes (3%). The third axis codes the temporal relationship between seizure occurrence and EEG changes during psychoses. lnterictal onset (69%) was most frequent followed by postictal (15%), para-ictal (6%), and other (5%). EEG changes during psychoses were seen in 38%, and normalization of the EEG was seen in 4%of patients. In 22%, EEG could not be recorded during psychoses (22%). The fourth axis codes the precipitating factors of psychoses. Specific personality trait (20%), changes in drug-regimen (l4%), co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders (12%), and psychosocial factors (10%) were seen. The fifth axis codes the organic background. Abnormal findings by brain imaging techniques (38%). mild intelligence deficiency (30%), and previous history of brain damage (27%) were noted. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate the heterogeneity of epileptic psychoses. We have proposed a 5-axial classification that appears to provide a convenient format for organizing and communicating clinical information to assist clinical practice and facilitate research. Using those guidelines, we may be able to improve our under- standing of the pathogenesis, develop suitable treatment, predict the prognosis, and ultimately establish appropriate intervention strategies.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of longitudinal drift in scanner hardware, inter-scanner variability (bias), and scanner upgrade on longitudinal changes in global and regional diffusion properties using longitudinal data obtained on two scanners of the exact same model at one institution. A total of 224 normal subjects were scanned twice, at an interval of about 1 year, using two 3.0-T scanners of the exact same model. Both scanners were simultaneously upgraded during the study period. The subjects were divided into four groups according to the combination of scanners used. With use of tract-based spatial statistics, we evaluated the effects of scanner drift and inter-scanner variability (bias) on global and regional fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) changes of the white matter. Even with scanners of the exact same model, inter-scanner variability (bias) significantly affected longitudinal results. FA, AD, and RD of the white matter were relatively stable within the same scanner. We also investigated the effect of scanner upgrade on longitudinal FA, AD, and RD changes. The scanner upgrade included only software upgrade, not hardware upgrade; however, there was a significant effect of scanner upgrade on longitudinal results. These results indicate that inter-scanner variability and scanner upgrade can significantly affect the results of longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging studies.
