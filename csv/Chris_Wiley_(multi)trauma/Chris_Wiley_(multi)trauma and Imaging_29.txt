AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used with increasing frequency to diagnose injuries of the collateral ligaments (CLs) of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, but the results have not been verified by histology and the mechanism of injury is poorly understood. Hypothesis: Abnormal signal intensity and tissue contour represents change in tissue structure detected on histology. Objectives: To compare results in horses free from and those with chronic lameness and to describe possible progression of lesions. Methods: One or both feet of horses free from lameness (Group N: n = 12) and with foot-related lameness (Group L: n = 25) were examined using MRI and by gross post mortem examination. The magnetic resonance (MR) images were graded. Sagittal sections from the proximal and distal aspect of each CL were examined histologically and each ligament assigned a score. Scintigraphic images from lame horses were also evaluated. Results: In Group N, 25 CLs were graded normal on both MR images and histology, 2 CLs were grade 1 on MR images, but were histologically normal, and 2 CLs had MR abnormalities verified histologically. However, 2 CLs appeared normal on MR images but were histologically abnormal. In Group L, 18 CLs were deemed normal on both MR images and histology, and 54 CLs had MR abnormalities verified histologically. However, 13 CLs appeared normal on MR images but were graded abnormal histologically. Lesions appeared to be degenerative, characterised by extensive fibrocartilaginous metaplasia and development of multiple, intercommunicating fissures within the degenerate collagen in severe lesions. There was an association between increased radiopharmaceutical uptake and a higher histological score. Conclusions: High-field MRI is reasonably reliable for detection of lesions of the CLs of the DIP joint, but may underestimate their prevalence. Clinical relevance: Collateral ligament injury appears to be a primary degenerative process, which may explain the poor response to conservative treatment and a need for promotion of regeneration.

AB  - ABSTRACT The spatiotemporal analysis of the proteomic profile during human wound healing is a critical investigative step that can establish the complex interplay of molecular events that comprise the local response to burn injury. Partial-thickness wound samples with adjacent ?normal? skin were collected from twenty-one patients with burn wounds and examined across a time spectrum ranging from the acute injury period at 3, 6, 11 days to the later hypertrophic scar period at 7 and 15 months. The techniques used for histology-directed tissue analyses highlighted inflammatory protein markers at the early time points after injury with diminished expression as burn wounds progressed into the proliferative phase. The datasets show the usefulness of MALDI MS and imaging mass spectrometry as discovery approaches to identify and map the cutaneous molecular sequence that is activated in response to the unique systemic inflammatory response following burn trauma. This information has the potential to define the unique factors that predispose human burn victims to disfiguring hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Abstract A variant of the Implicit Association Test focusing on the association of sexual and aggressive themes was administered to 90 college students (61 women) and correlated with a series of variables based on participant history of sexually traumatic events. A history of sexual abuse was correlated with increased difficulties in processing sexual and aggressive concepts simultaneously. Furthermore, this relationship remained significant after controlling for general level of emotional distress, and even after controlling for self-reported aggressiveness and positive feelings towards sex. The findings provide grounds for further exploration of deficits in associations between sexual and aggressive concepts as a possible indicator of the cognitive effects of sexual abuse.

AB  - Migraine or headache is a common problem in the active duty population, in the recently deployed service members, and is a cardinal symptom of traumatic brain injury. While there is increasing appreciation of the clinical burden of post-traumatic headache (PTHA) in the military traumatic brain injury population, there remain significant research gaps related to the epidemiology of PTHA, including lack of understanding of natural history, whether there are predisposing factors that predict the development or prognosis of headache post trauma and, most basically, the features that distinguish PTHA from other forms of chronic headache. Although diagnostic criteria for PTHA are included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, revised, these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and were not empirically defined. This lack of precision about the PTHA phenotype limits the rigor of observational studies of PTH but does not appear to significantly hamper treatment, provided the treatment involves a multi-modality approach.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole in dogs with diagnosis of meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology. Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.

AB  - Objectives: To review the presenting clinical signs, treatment and survival of dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma and, if possible, to identify useful prognostic indicators. Methods: Medical records of 44 dogs were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical signs, clinical stage, time of diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Results: The most frequent clinical signs were cough (12 dogs, 27%), enlarged lymph nodes (11 dogs, 25%) and dysphagia (11 dogs, 25%). Anorexia and lethargy were less common but were significantly associated with a poor outcome. No matter what treatment modalities were used, survival times were short and median survival time for all the dogs in the study was 179 days. However, there were a small number of long-term survivors. Clinical Significance: Dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma that suffered anorexia and lethargy had shorter survival times than patients without these clinical signs. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seem to increase the median survival time of dogs diagnosed with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, there is no highly effective treatment for canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract Electrophysiological recording during in vivo NMR imaging for correlation of electrophysiological events with changes in NMR parameters has, until now, not been satisfactory. Here we present a method that uses specially prepared calomel electrodes for the continuous monitoring of both cortical steady potential and EEG during in vivo NMR imaging studies of experimental animal models. In order to demonstrate the reliability of this approach we elicited single episodes of cortical spreading depression in rats by intracortical potassium acetate injection, using an intracerebral micropipette. During the passage of DC potential shifts and associated reduction in EEG amplitude, hyperintense regions, reflecting the progression of cortical spreading depression over the cortex, were visible in diffusion-weighted images of the rat brains. No susceptibility artifacts due to the electrodes and micropipette were visible in the NMR data. Thus, we have demonstrated under controlled experimental conditions, that electrophysiological recording with calomel electrodes can be performed simultaneously with diffusion-weighted NMR imaging. The described method enables further NMR investigations of phenomena which are detectable by electrophysiology.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions and misidentifications have been reported in dementia ranging from 10% to 73% in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and up to 40% in multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in 61 AD and 31 MID patients both the frequency and the content of delusions during the course of illness and to evaluate the relationship between these and both functional and mental decline. The results indicated that delusion experiences had occurred in 45% of AD patients and in 38% of MID patients, occurring most frequently during the first year of illness. Patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms showed higher mini mental state examination scores and were less impaired in functional disability measures. With regard to the content, no significant differences were observed between AD and MID patients; 53% of psychotic symptoms were found to be paranoid delusions while 47% were misidentification delusions.

AB  - Abstract Parametric subtracted post-ictal diffusion tensor imaging (pspiDTI) is a novel imaging technique developed at our center to visualize transient, patient-specific, ictal-associated water diffusion abnormalities in hippocampal-associated axonal tissue. PspiDTI can elucidate putative connectivity patterns, tracing ictal propagation following a partial-onset seizure without generalization secondarily. PspiDTI compares two DTI volumes acquired during the early post-ictal period (<4 hr), and baseline inter-ictal interval (>24?hr post-seizure). This technique performs a voxel-wise parametric test to identify statistically significant transient ictal-associated changes in water diffusivity involving white matter (WM). Our technique was applied to six patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy who were candidates for direct cortical responsive neurostimulation (RNS) therapy. Global and region-specific fractional anisotropy decreases, relative to baseline, were detected in all patients with a 17.01% (p <?.01) relative mean decrement, while trace increases were found in 6/6 (100%) patients with a 13.30% (p <?.01) relative global mean increment. Changes in diffusivity were anatomically compared with transient hyper-perfusion as detected by subtracted ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM). In 5/6 (83.33%) patients, alterations in WM diffusivity were detected adjacent to the SISCOM signal localized predominantly in gray matter. In 4/6 patients, post-implant RNS electrocorticography revealed early ictal propagation between implanted RNS depth leads guided by pspiDTI, hence validating concordant abnormal diffusivity regions detected by our technique. PspiDTI can complement the conventional pre-surgical evaluation to provide additional crucial information regarding WM ictal-propagation pathways between predominantly gray matter ictal-onset zones. When incorporated into a multi-modality pre-surgical workflow, pspiDTI can aid in defining critical nodes between ictogenic regions. This information can be used to strategically implant a limited set of two RNS depth leads for maximizing the extent to which direct cortical RNS can modulate a potentially extensive epileptogenic network.

Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Abstract With the growing elusiveness of the state apparatus in late modernity, military service is one of the last institutions to be clearly identified with the state, its ideologies and its policies. Therefore, negotiations between the military and its recruits produce acting subjects of citizenship with long-lasting consequences. Arguing that these negotiations are regulated by multi-level (civic, group, and individual) contracts, we explore the various meanings that these contracts obtain at the intersectionality of gender, class, and ethnicity; and examine how they shape the subjective experience of soldierhood and citizenship. More particularly, we analyse the meaning of military service in the retrospective life stories of Israeli Jewish women from various ethno-class backgrounds who served as army secretaries ? a low-status, feminine gender-typed occupation within a hyper-masculine organization. Findings reveal that for women of the lower class, the organizing cultural schema of the multi-level contract is that of achieving respectability through military service, which means being included in the national collective. Conversely, for middle-class women, it is the sense of entitlement that shapes their contract with the military, which they expect to signify and maintain their privileged status. Thus, while for the lower class, the multi-level contract is about inclusion within the boundaries of the national collective, for the dominant groups, this contract is about reproducing social class hierarchies within national boundaries.

Ultrasonography and radiography of the right stifle revealed signs of joint collapse and periarticular swelling. Computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the bone density of the medial femoral condyle of the right hindlimb and lateral femoral condyle of the left hindlimb. Euthanasia was recommended based on the severity of the lesions. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed extensive separation of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex from the subchondral bone of the femoral condyles. The histological features suggest an ischaemic aetiology; comparisons are made with lesions of osteochondrosis and avascular necrosis of bone.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.
