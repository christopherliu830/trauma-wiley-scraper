AB  - Summary The cervical spine is approached in two separate anatomic and functional regions: the craniocervical junction (occiput, C1 and C2) and the subaxial spine (C3 to C7). Injury to the craniocervical junction or cervical spine trauma is usually indirect, related to forces transmitted through the head. Current recommendations for initial imaging in adults with suspected cervical spine injury is a thin slice CT of the cervical spine. The most common fracture of C1 is a bilateral vertical fracture through the neural arch. Fractures of C2 may occur in isolation or in association with additional cervical spine fractures. The most common fracture of C2 involves the odontoid, followed by Hangman's fracture, anteroinferior endplate (hyperextension teardrop) and least commonly, isolated C2 body or posterior element fractures. A burst fracture commonly results from combined axial loading and flexion vector in C5, C6, and C7 locations. Compression fractures are common in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

AB  - Summary The shoulder has greatest range of motion of any joint in the body, and is a frequent site of injury. Shoulder girdle includes proximal humerus, scapula, and lateral clavicle. The anatomic structures involved in fracture of the proximal humerus include humeral head, anatomic neck, surgical neck, and greater and lesser tuberosities. The fractures to the proximal humerus result from a direct blow, fall on an outstretched hand in the elderly, or are related to glenohumeral joint fracture-dislocation. Fractures of the humeral shaft may result from direct trauma, high-velocity motor vehicle accidents or a fall. Scapular fractures are infrequent as the scapula is surrounded and protected by large and prominent muscle attachments. Acromioclavicular joint injury is commonly due to a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Radiographs are generally the first step in initial imaging modality for patients with shoulder trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background The Trauma Pod (TP) vision is to develop a rapidly deployable robotic system to perform critical acute stabilization and/or surgical procedures, autonomously or in a teleoperative mode, on wounded soldiers in the battlefield who might otherwise die before treatment in a combat hospital could be provided. Methods In the first phase of a project pursuing this vision, a robotic TP system was developed and its capability demonstrated by performing selected surgical procedures on a patient phantom. Results The system demonstrates the feasibility of performing acute stabilization procedures with the patient being the only human in the surgical cell. The teleoperated surgical robot is supported by autonomous robotic arms and subsystems that carry out scrub-nurse and circulating-nurse functions. Tool change and supply delivery are performed automatically and at least as fast as performed manually by nurses. Tracking and counting of the supplies is performed automatically. The TP system also includes a tomographic X-ray facility for patient diagnosis and two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic data to support interventions. The vast amount of clinical protocols generated in the TP system are recorded automatically. Conclusions Automation and teleoperation capabilities form the basis for a more comprehensive acute diagnostic and management platform that will provide life-saving care in environments where surgical personnel are not present.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Abstract Blunt chest trauma is a common occurrence in vehicle accident. Cardiac injuries following nonpenetrating thoracic trauma have been reported. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to coronary artery involvement is a rare but extremely serious condition for the high risk of undetected diagnosis. Blunt thoracic trauma may obscure typical chest pain associated with cardiac ischemia especially in patients with high tolerance of pain or secondary administration of analgesic drugs. We report two consecutive cases of young adults admitted to our emergency department after motorcycle accident and concomitant anterior STEMI due to occlusion of left anterior descending artery. In both cases primary percutaneous coronary intervention with a second generation drug eluting stent implantation was successfully performed. Imaging with intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography showed the mechanisms of coronary occlusion, allowing an optimal stent implantation and avoiding procedural complications in this complex setting.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate a model-independent, multi-directional anisotropy (MDA) metric that is analytically and experimentally equivalent to fractional anisotropy (FA) in single-direction diffusivity, but potentially superior to FA in its sensitivity to the underlying anisotropy of multi-directional diffusivity. Materials and Methods An expression for MDA was defined from the orientation distribution function (ODF) and its analytical relation to FA was derived. Simulations of single and crossed double-fibers were performed using a compressed-sensing-accelerated diffusion-spectrum-imaging (CS-DSI) scheme. In vivo brain imaging using CS-DSI was performed on eight healthy subjects. MDA was compared with FA and with another ODF-based metric known as generalized FA (GFA). Results In simulated single-direction fibers, MDA was shown to be equivalent to FA (from FA?=?0.2 to 0.8). In crossed fibers, MDA provided superior differentiation of the underlying anisotropy as compared to FA and GFA. In vivo analysis shows that the MDA was superior to both FA (P?=?0.015) and GFA (P?=?0.021) in terms of its relative accuracy in crossed fiber regions. Conclusion MDA provides a potentially superior measure of fiber anisotropy relative to conventional FA or GFA, and may be used to improve the assessment of disease in regions with multi-directional brain fibers.

AB  - Rationale Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the recovery process post-stroke is essential; however, longer-term recovery studies are lacking. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) can image biological recovery processes, but is limited by spatial resolution and its targeted nature. Untargeted mass spectrometry imaging offers high spatial resolution, providing an ideal ex vivo tool for brain recovery imaging. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to image a rat brain 48 h after ischaemic stroke to locate the infarcted regions of the brain. PET was carried out 3 months post-stroke using the tracers [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO and [18F]IAM6067 for sigma-1 receptors to image neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, respectively. The rat brain was flash-frozen immediately after PET scanning, and sectioned for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging. Results Three months post-stroke, PET imaging shows minimal detection of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, indicating that the brain has stabilised. However, MALDI-MS images reveal distinct differences in lipid distributions (e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) between the scar and the healthy brain, suggesting that recovery processes are still in play. It is currently not known if the altered lipids in the scar will change on a longer time scale, or if they are stabilised products of the brain post-stroke. Conclusions The data demonstrates the ability to combine MALD-MS with in vivo PET to image different aspects of stroke recovery.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the role of levator ani trauma in anal incontinence (AI), whilst controlling for anal sphincter injury. Methods The records of 1273 patients who had attended a tertiary urogynaecology unit between 1st of January to 31st December 2016 were reviewed. AI was assessed using St Mark's score and visual analogue scale (VAS). Levator muscle and anal sphincter trauma were examined by translabial ultrasound using tomographic imaging, with archived data sets investigated blinded against all clinical data. A complete avulsion was diagnosed if at least three central tomographic slices showed an abnormal muscle insertion, rated separately for each side. A significant anal sphincter defect was diagnosed if at least four out of six slices showed a defect of ≥ 30°. Results Avulsion was associated with St Mark's score (P = 0.005) and VAS bother of AI (P = 0.022) both on univariate analysis and when controlling for external anal sphincter (EAS) trauma on translabial imaging, forceps, body mass index (BMI) and age (P = 0.011 and P = 0.04, respectively). AI expressed as a binary variable was significantly associated with avulsion on univariate analysis (P = 0.011), although the association became nonsignificant after controlling for anal sphincter trauma, age, BMI and forceps delivery (P = 0.084). Conclusion In this retrospective observational study, we found a weak association between levator ani avulsion and measures of AI, which largely remained significant when controlling for anal sphincter trauma. However, given the large data set, any clinical effect of levator trauma on AI is likely to be minor.

AB  - Objective To describe the technique and findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? protocol in dogs suffering from trauma. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive processing speed is crucial for human cognition and declines with aging. White matter hyperintensity (WMH), a common sign of WM vascular damage in the elderly, is closely related to slower psychomotor processing speed. In this study, we investigated the association between WMH and psychomotor speed changes through a comprehensive assessment of brain structural and functional features. Multi-modal MRIs were acquired from 60 elderly adults. Psychomotor processing speeds were assessed using the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A). Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between TMT-A and brain features, including WMH volumes in five cerebral regions, diffusivity parameters in the major WM tracts, regional gray matter volume, and brain activities across the whole brain. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to demonstrate the contribution of each index to slower psychomotor processing speed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that WMH volume in the occipital lobe and fractional anisotropy of the forceps major, an occipital association tract, were associated with TMT-A. Besides, resting-state brain activities in the visual cortex connected to the forceps major were associated with TMT-A. Hierarchical regression showed fractional anisotropy of the forceps major and regional brain activities were significant predictors of TMT-A. The occurrence of WMH, combined with the disruption of passing-through fiber integrity and altered functional activities in areas connected by this fiber, are associated with a decline of psychomotor processing speed. While the causal relationship of this WMH-Tract-Function-Behavior link requires further investigation, this study enhances our understanding of these complex mechanisms.

AB  - Background Trauma systems have improved outcomes for injured patients, but might be challenging to implement. We assessed the implementation of a trauma system in Norway after recommendations for a national trauma system were published in 2007, with a focus on elements in acute care hospitals. Methods All hospitals in Norway, except for the four regional trauma centres, admitting injured patients at the time of the study were included in a telephone survey. The questionnaire was administered during May 2013 by the regional trauma coordinators who interviewed the local trauma coordinator and/or the local doctor responsible for trauma care in all the acute care hospitals. The main categories were availability of the trauma team and team training, written procedures, preparedness and training of personnel. The compliance to a set of 17 predefined trauma system criteria was evaluated at each institution. Results Of the 35 acute care hospitals in Norway admitting trauma patients at the time of the survey, all were included. The median number of fulfilled criteria was 14. Major deficiencies were found in fulfilling competence criteria, maintaining a local trauma registry, and trauma audits. The number of fulfilled criteria correlated strongly with the size of the hospital and the frequency of trauma team activation. Conclusions Shortcomings in requirements for lower-level trauma care hospitals correlate to hospital size and frequency with which the trauma team is activated. In order to fulfill the minimum requirements, smaller hospitals should receive more attention.

AB  - Abstract Background Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) occurs in 0.2?2.7% of blunt trauma patients and has up to 30% mortality. Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83?100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20?67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002?0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314?0.068), respectively. Conclusions Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95?97% and reduces its hazards.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a high-resolution, multimodal and translatable imaging protocol to characterize experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Small animal imaging modalities include fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either lateral fluid percussion (LFP) or controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI with mild or moderate severity. Baseline FDG-PET and MRI scans were conducted prior to injury and at various times post-TBI. FDG-PET/CT images were acquired on a Siemens Inveon Multimodality scanner based on IV injection of 37 ? 74 MBq (1 ? 2 mCi) of FDG. Diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopic images along with susceptibility and T1/T2-weighted images were acquired on a Bruker Biospec 7T/20 cm magnet running Paravision 5.1. Results: For translatable FDG-PET imaging, a tail vein injection of FDG with 45 minutes of anesthetized uptake and 30 minutes of scanning was optimal. With the brain centered in the field of view, uptakes (ipsilateral and contralateral) were normalized by cerebellar uptake since blood sampling was not conducted. The 2-hour MRI protocol included fast spin echo (100 um), 3D multi-echo gradient echo susceptibility (100 um), 4-shot EPI-based continuous arterial spin labeling (152 um), 8-shot EPI-based with three direction diffusion (100 um), and single voxel PRESS spectroscopy(3 mm) Conclusions: The impact of TBI on military service members is significant with more than 5,500 soldiers diagnosed with TBIs. Early diagnosis and development of an effective treatment for veterans with TBI is a priority for the military. A multimodal and multi-parameter imaging protocol for experimental TBI that is both translatable and efficient (high throughput) is pivotal for studying neuroprotection, regeneration, and plasticity. An optimized small animal imaging protocol was developed to investigate longitudinal changes in glucose utilization (FDG-PET/CT), cortical volume, diffuse axonal injury, perfusion, and metabolite concentration (MRI).

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - ABSTRACT The integrity of the fornix using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in adolescent participants with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) compared to a demographically matched control group was examined. Fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix was elevated in the mild traumatic brain injured group. Performance on the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) was lower in the group with mTBI. A relation was found between lower performance on cognitive tasks and higher FA. The potential role of fornix injury as a basis of memory and processing speed deficits in mTBI is discussed.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract The prevention of hospital acquired pressure ulcers in critically ill patients remains a significant clinical challenge. The aim of this trial was to investigate the effectiveness of multi-layered soft silicone foam dressings in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) pressure ulcers when applied in the emergency department to 440 trauma and critically ill patients. Intervention group patients (n = 219) had Mepilex? Border Sacrum and Mepilex? Heel dressings applied in the emergency department and maintained throughout their ICU stay. Results revealed that there were significantly fewer patients with pressure ulcers in the intervention group compared to the control group (5 versus 20, P = 0·001). This represented a 10% difference in incidence between the groups (3·1% versus 13·1%) and a number needed to treat of ten patients to prevent one pressure ulcer. Overall there were fewer sacral (2 versus 8, P = 0·05) and heel pressure ulcers (5 versus 19, P = 0·002) and pressure injuries overall (7 versus 27, P = 0·002) in interventions than in controls. The time to injury survival analysis indicated that intervention group patients had a hazard ratio of 0·19 (P = 0·002) compared to control group patients. We conclude that multi-layered soft silicone foam dressings are effective in preventing pressure ulcers in critically ill patients when applied in the emergency department prior to ICU transfer.

AB  - Summary A digital image can be printed on film or paper as a hard copy, or it can be displayed on a cathode ray tube video monitor or a liquid crystal display as a soft copy. The quality of a digital image is generally measured by three parameters: spatial resolution, density resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Medical Imaging was used by radiologists for diagnostic purposes. This chapter highlights the generic radiology workflow. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS)-based multimedia imaging informatics is a system integration of multimedia imaging informatics with patient imaging, which requires workflow and diagnostic components and procedures. The chapter describes the principle of digital mammography, a critical component of total digital imaging operation in a hospital. It summarizes the hybrid direct slot-scanning method. The chapter also describes several current clinical and work-in-progress magnetic resonance (MR) image types that can be generated from MR signals, and some of them have been used in clinical environment.
