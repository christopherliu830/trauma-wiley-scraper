AB  - Abstract We treated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) and evaluated the effect of treatment on white matter reorganization using MRI. We subjected male Wistar rats (n?=?17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n?=?9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n?=?8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p?<?0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T2 in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, compared with FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FT and T2 can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe case mix variation among institutions, and report adverse event rates in congenital cardiac catheterization by case type. Background: Reported adverse event rates for patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization vary considerably, due to non-comparable standards of data inclusion, and highly variable case mix. Methods: The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Outcomes Project (C3PO) has been capturing case characteristics and adverse events (AE) for all cardiac catheterizations performed at six pediatric institutions. Validity and completeness of data were independently audited. Results: Between 2/1/07 and 4/30/08, 3855 cases (670 biopsy, 1037 diagnostic, and 2148 interventional) were recorded, median number of cases per site 480 (308 to 1526). General anesthesia was used in 70% of cases (28 to 99%), and 22% of cases (15 to 26%) were non-electively or emergently performed. Three institutions performed a higher proportion of interventions during a case, 72 to 77% compared to 56 to 58%. The median rate of AE reported per institution was 16%, ranging from 5 to 18%. For interventional cases the median rate of AE reported per institution was 19% (7 to 25%) compared to 10% for diagnostic cases (6 to 16%). The incidence of AE was significantly higher for interventional compared to diagnostic cases (20% vs 10%, p<0.001), as was the incidence of higher severity AE (9% vs 5%, p<0.001). Adverse events in biopsy cases were uncommon. Conclusions: In this multi-institutional cohort, the incidence of AE is higher among interventional compared to diagnostic cases, and is very low among biopsy cases. Equitable comparisons among institutions will require the development and application of risk adjustment methods.

AB  - Abstract This paper contrasts the loss of mind from the loss of brain cells in Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions with the threats to one's mind from the mindlessness of others from a cognitive-analytic perspective. Case studies are presented that show how the therapeutic framework of Cognitive-Analytic Therapy (CAT: Ryle 1990, 1995, 1997) can bring containment for both client and therapist for clients facing this dilemma, particularly when past trauma is potentially overwhelming. This is set in a dialogue with the pioneering work of Tom Kitwood (1990, 1995, 1997) in dementia care, in which Kitwood's thesis of the ?malignant social psychology? surrounding people with dementia is re-stated in terms of ?reciprocal roles? developed in Cognitive-Analytic Therapy.

AB  - Objective:? This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a four-session, caregiver?child Intervention, the Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), to prevent the development of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provided within 30 days of exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Method:? One-hundred seventy-six 7 to 17-year-old youth were recruited through telephone screening based on report of one new distressing posttraumatic stress symptom after a PTE. Of those, 106 youth were randomly assigned to the Intervention (n = 53) or a four-session supportive Comparison condition (N = 53). Group differences in symptom severity were assessed using repeated measures with mixed effects models of intervention group, time, and the interaction of intervention and time. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess treatment condition and any subsequent traumas experienced as predictors for full and partial PTSD diagnosis at 3-month follow-up. An exploratory chi-square analysis was performed to examine the differences in PTSD symptom criteria B, C, and D at follow-up. Results:? At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, past trauma exposures and symptom severity. At follow-up, the Intervention group demonstrated significantly fewer full and partial PTSD diagnoses than the Comparison group on a standardized diagnostic measure of PTSD. Also, there was a significant group by time interaction for Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children?s Posttraumatic Stress and Anxiety Indices as the CFTSI group had significantly lower posttraumatic and anxiety scores than the Comparison group. Conclusions:? The results suggest that a caregiver?youth, brief preventative early intervention for youth exposed to a PTE is a promising approach to preventing chronic PTSD.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Polyheal compared with surgery in treating chronic wounds with exposed bones and/or tendons (EB&T) due to trauma in France, Germany and the UK, from the perspective of the payers. Decision models were constructed depicting the management of chronic wounds with EB&T and spanned the period up to healing or up to 1 year. The models considered the decision by a plastic surgeon to treat these wounds with Polyheal or surgery and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of Polyheal at 2010/2011 prices. Using Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to increase the probability of healing from 0Â·93 to 0Â·98 and lead to a total health-care cost of ?7984, ?7517 and ?8860 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Management with surgery is expected to lead to a total health-care cost of ?12 300, ?18 137 and ?11 330 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Hence, initial treatment with Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to lead to a 5% improvement in the probability of healing and a substantial decrease in health-care costs of 35%, 59% and 22% in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Within the models' limitations, Polyheal potentially affords the public health-care system in France, Germany and the UK a cost-effective treatment for chronic wounds with EB&T due to trauma, when compared with surgery. However, this will be dependent on Polyheal's healing rate in clinical practice when it becomes routinely available.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the consequent progression to cirrhosis is expected to become a major cause of liver transplantation. This will exacerbate the organ donor shortage and mean that ?marginal? fatty liver grafts are more frequently used. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a fast, objective, and non-destructive method to detect change in the endogenous fluorophores distribution and could prove to be a valuable tool for NAFLD diagnosis and transplant graft assessment. Materials and Methods A system was constructed consisting of a fibre probe with two laser diodes that provided excitation light at 375 and 405?nm, and an imaging spectrograph system. This was used to distinguish fluorescence spectra acquired from the harvested livers from mice with NAFLD of differing severity (healthy, mild steatotic and steatohepatitic). The fluorescence data were entered into a sparse multiclass probabilistic algorithm for disease classification. Histopathology, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and alanine transaminase (ALT) assays were conducted in addition to the fluorescence measurements Results TBARS and ALT assays enabled differentiation of the steatohepatitic group from the mild steatosis and control groups (P?â‰¤?0.028) but failed to separate the mild steatotic group from the control group. The three groups were all clearly differentiated from each other using fluorescence spectroscopy, and classification accuracy was found to be 95%. Conclusion Fluorescence spectroscopy appears to be a promising approach for the analysis of diseased liver tissue. Lasers Surg. Med. 43:392?400, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Concussion pathophysiology in humans remains incompletely understood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has identified microstructural abnormalities in otherwise normal appearing brain tissue, using measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). The results of prior DTI studies suggest that acute alterations in microstructure persist beyond medical clearance to return to play (RTP), but these measures lack specificity. To better understand the observed effects, this study combined DTI with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), which employs a more sophisticated description of water diffusion in the brain. A total of 66 athletes were recruited, including 33 concussed athletes, scanned within 7?days after concussion and at RTP, along with 33 matched controls. Both univariate and multivariate methods identified DTI and NODDI parameters showing effects of concussion on white matter. Spatially extensive decreases in FA and increases in AD and RD were associated with reduced intra-neurite water volume, at both the symptomatic phase of injury and RTP, indicating that effects persist beyond medical clearance. Subsequent analyses also demonstrated that concussed athletes with higher symptom burden and a longer recovery time had greater reductions in FA and increased AD, RD, along with increased neurite dispersion. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of concussion from acute injury to RTP using combined DTI and NODDI, significantly enhancing our understanding of the effects of concussion on white matter microstructure.

AB  - Abstract Background Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is traditionally used to image patients in restrictive positions, with few devices allowing for upright, brain-dedicated imaging. Our team has explored the concept of wearable PET imagers which could provide functional brain imaging of freely moving subjects. To test feasibility and determine future considerations for development, we built a rudimentary proof-of-concept prototype (Helmet_PET) and conducted tests in phantoms and four human volunteers. Methods Twelve Silicon Photomultiplier-based detectors were assembled in a ring with exterior weight support and an interior mechanism that could be adjustably fitted to the head. We conducted brain phantom tests as well as scanned four patients scheduled for diagnostic F18-FDG PET/CT imaging. For human subjects the imager was angled such that field of view included basal ganglia and visual cortex to test for typical resting-state pattern. Imaging in two subjects was performed ~4Â hr after PET/CT imaging to simulate lower injected F18-FDG dose by taking advantage of the natural radioactive decay of the tracer (F18 half-life of 110Â min), with an estimated imaging dosage of 25% of the standard. Results We found that imaging with a simple lightweight ring of detectors was feasible using a fraction of the standard radioligand dose. Activity levels in the human participants were quantitatively similar to standard PET in a set of anatomical ROIs. Typical resting-state brain pattern activation was demonstrated even in a 1Â min scan of active head rotation. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of imaging a human subject with a novel wearable PET imager that moves with robust head movements. We discuss potential research and clinical applications that will drive the design of a fully functional device. Designs will need to consider trade-offs between a low weight device with high mobility and a heavier device with greater sensitivity and larger field of view.

AB  - Background: Few data are available to establish recommendations for trace element supplementation during critical illness. This study quantified the loss of several elements and assessed the adequacy of manganese and selenium in parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods: Men with traumatic injuries were grouped by renal status: adequate (POLY; n = 6), acute failure with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH; n = 2), or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD; n = 4). PN supplied 300 ?g/d manganese and 60 ?g/d selenium. Urine and effluent (from artificial kidneys) were collected for 3 days and analyzed for boron, manganese, nickel, and silicon using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, and for selenium using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: POLY manganese and selenium excretion averaged (standard deviation [SD]) 7.9 (3.3)? g/d and 103.5 (22.4) ?g/d, respectively. All elements except selenium were detected in dialysate (prior to use). CVVHD effluent contained 3.5 and 7.3 times more manganese and nickel than CVVH ultrafiltrate, respectively. Loss of manganese averaged 2.6%, 21%, and 73% of PN amounts for POLY, CVVH, and CVVHD groups, respectively. Discussion: Minimal loss of manganese compared with the amount in PN suggests that excessive amounts are retained. POLY patients excreted more selenium than was in PN, indicating negative balance. POLY losses of boron and silicon were less than that published for healthy adults, reflecting less than typical intake, whereas loss during CVVH was in the normal reference range, possibly because of added intake from boron contamination of replacement fluids. All patients lost more nickel than amounts published for healthy adults. Conclusions: Current guidelines of 60-100 ?g/d of parenteral manganese may be excessive for trauma patients. The uptake of manganese and nickel from contaminants in CVVHD dialysate should be investigated.

AB  - Background The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of three-dimensional power Doppler imaging (3D-PDI) in the assessment of the patency of the fallopian tubes during hystero-salpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Methods HyCoSy using contrast medium echovist was done on 67 subfertile women. 3D-PDI and two-dimensional (2D) gray-scale imaging were used to visualize the contrast medium in the tubes. Results Contrast medium echovist produced prominent signals on the 3D-PDI image. Free spill of the fallopian tubes which had had the proximal part visualized was demonstrated in 114 (91%) tubes using 3D-PDI technique and in 58 (46%) tubes using conventional HyCoSy. The mean duration of imaging procedure was less than 3D-PDI. A significantly lower volume of contrast medium (5.9?+?0.6?ml) was used for 3D-PDI in comparison with volume (11.2?+?1.9?ml) used for conventional HyCoSy. Conclusions The 3D-PDI method appeared to have advantages over the conventional HyCoSy technique, especially in terms of visualization of spill from the distal end of the tube which was achieved twice as often with the 3D technique. The shorter duration of the imaging and lower volume of the contrast medium used suggested that the 3D-PDI technique may have a better side-effect profile. The 3D-PDI technique allowed better storage of the information for re-analysis and archiving than 2D scanning.

AB  - Aim:? While volumetric and metabolic imaging on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients has been intensively performed, few studies using electroencephalograms (EEG) have been done as yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate abnormalities in functional connectivity of cortical networks in PTSD. Methods:? Non-linear interdependence (NI), a measure of bidirectional, non-linear information transmission between two time series, was used. Resting EEG were recorded for 18 PTSD patients and 18 sex-matched healthy subjects on 16 channels with their eyes closed. Results:? The NI patterns in PTSD patients were hemisphere asymmetric: an increase in NI in the fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the left hemisphere (F7, F3, T3, C3, T5 and P3) and a decrease in the fronto-parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere (F4, C4, P4 and O2). The non-linearity of NI in EEG, estimated from the surrogate data method, exhibited an increase in the PTSD patients as compared with that of healthy subjects, particularly in the left hemispheric cortex. Conclusion:? Abnormal functional connectivity in PTSD can be assessed using NI, a measure of multi-channel EEG.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Spinal clearance in unconscious children following traumatic brain injury is an area of controversy. The risk of significant injury in this high-risk group needs to be balanced against that of prolonged spinal immobilization and all its implications. No national or international guideline exists to aid clinicians faced with such a scenario. This article reviews traumatic spinal injury in children looking at prevalence, risk factors, anatomical considerations, and radiological investigation. Spinal immobilization is discussed along with the use of appropriate and targeted radiological investigations to aid clearance.

AB  - Abstract Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is an uncommon medical condition that may be encountered by otolaryngologists and facial plastic surgeons. TTS begins with damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central sensory connections, causing anesthesia in a dermatomal distribution. With repeated scratching and manipulation, an ulceration occurs, often in the alar region. In this multi-institutional report, we summarize a small series of patients with TTS. Treatment options are discussed along with a review of the relevant literature. Although rare, it is important that practicing otolaryngologists be familiar with the classic signs and symptoms of this condition in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary Bone metastases can be classified into osteolytic, osteoblastic/sclerotic, or mixed phenotypes. Imaging plays a vital role in the detection, evaluation, and monitoring of osseous metastatic disease. Plain radiographs can be used to assess the alignment of bone/vertebrae, the presence of fractures, and?by measuring cortical thickness?the risk for fracture. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a method of measuring bone mineral density that is in widespread use for osteoporosis detection. Radionuclide bone scintigraphy (RBS) demonstrates areas of active bone remodeling through the phosphate groups in the administered radiotracers binding to hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix. Micro-SPECT (?SPECT) is a preclinical version of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) that is used in animals. Due to high sensitivity, only tiny amounts of radiotracer are needed, and multiple tracers can be used to image several molecular events simultaneously.
