AB  - Abstract Advances in interventional radiology and surgical techniques now allow complex abdominal diseases to be more successfully treated in small animals. Abdominal vascular alterations, acquired as individual process or as complication of other lesions such as neoplasia, can be life-threatening or at least greatly limit curative interventions of underlying diseases. Computed tomography (CT) and high-definition ultrasonography are now readily available in veterinary referral centers. Yet, there is little information currently available on the use of these modalities for the diagnosis and characterization of these vascular alterations. The purpose of this article is to review the CT and ultrasonographic findings of acquired vascular diseases in the abdomen of dogs and cats, using both the veterinary and human medicine literature as references, and highlighting essential concepts through figures.

AB  - Abstract This article discusses critically the focus on stress symptoms when treating traumatized refugees. It describes common challenges that practitioners meet, when working with extreme trauma. It suggests three concepts that might help to understand the complicated dynamics of severe traumatization. These concepts deal as well with the nature of post-traumatic problems as with the way they might be treated. A clinical case is used to exemplify and discuss the concepts. Finally the article offers some thoughts on the special dynamics of the situation of refugees.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

AB  - Neoplastic meningitis, an unusual complication of systemic cancer, is becoming more common as cancer patients live longer. Although leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors are usually associated with multifocal neurological signs, the authors report on 4 patients who presented with normal findings on neurological exammation. One man had severe headache and complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bram revealed gadolmium enhancement of multiple cranial nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was positive for melanoma. One woman presented with severe migratory retroorbital headaches. MRIs of the brain with and without gadolinium appeared normal CSF cytology was positive for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. One man presented with morning headache, and a woman presented with back pain. Both had CSF cytologies positive for lymphoma. Neoplastic meningitis can occur without abnormalities on neurological or MRI examinations. Lumbar punctures should be performed on cancer patients with severe, unusual, or prolonged headaches.

AB  - Abstract This paper explores the social interaction among participants in a church service in an online multi-user virtual reality (VR) environment. It examines some of the main features of prayer meetings in a religiously-oriented virtual world and also what sets this world apart from other virtual worlds. Next, it examines some of the issues of research ethics and methods that are raised in the study of online behavior in virtual worlds. The paper then analyzes the text exchanges between participants in a virtual church service and some of the ways in which these compare with the content of a conventional church service. Finally, the paper draws out some implications for our understanding of the relation between interaction in the virtual and in the ?real? world.

AB  - Aim:? To determine whether intrasubject reproducibility could be observed in the frontal cortex and to assess the mental-health status of subjects in each session. Methods:? We measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) during a letter version of the verbal fluency task using near-infrared spectroscopy imaging in twenty healthy adults over two sessions approximately two months apart. Additionally, the mental-health status of the subjects in each session was evaluated according to the State?Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the Profile of Mood States, and the revised edition of the Neuroticism?Extroversion?Openness Personality Inventory. The association between those scores and [oxy-Hb] changes during the verbal fluency task in each session was investigated. Results:? Performance on the verbal fluency task was about equal across the two sessions, and frontal activation during the task was observed globally in approximately the same region. In the test?retest reliability, acceptable values were shown in both the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of the mean [oxy-Hb] changes and the correlation coefficients of the whole waveforms for each subject in the two sessions. Mental-health status as measured by several questionnaires was within the healthy range, and no correlation with the frontal activation was seen, except in several channels. Conclusion:? The current results suggest that the measurement experience exerted very little influence, except for in a very small region. In addition, the intrasubject reproducibility of frontal activation measured by multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy was well demonstrated in mentally healthy subjects at intervals of two months.

AB  - Since the brain's gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) metabolite concentrations differ, their partial volumes can vary the voxel's 1H MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) signal, reducing sensitivity to changes. While single-voxel 1H-MRS cannot differentiate between WM and GM signals, partial volume correction is feasible by MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) using segmentation of the MRI acquired for VOI placement. To determine the magnitude of this effect on metabolic quantification, we segmented a 1-mm3 resolution MRI into GM, WM and CSF masks that were co-registered with the MRSI grid to yield their partial volumes in approximately every 1 cm3 spectroscopic voxel. Each voxel then provided one equation with two unknowns: its i- metabolite's GM and WM concentrations CiGM, CiWM. With the voxels' GM and WM volumes as independent coefficients, the over-determined system of equations was solved for the global averaged CiGM and CiWM. Trading off local concentration differences offers three advantages: (i) higher sensitivity due to combined data from many voxels; (ii) improved specificity to WM versus GM changes; and (iii) reduced susceptibility to partial volume effects. These improvements made no additional demands on the protocol, measurement time or hardware. Applying this approach to 18 volunteered 3D MRSI sets of 480 voxels each yielded N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline and myo-inositol CiGM concentrations of 8.5?±?0.7, 6.9?±?0.6, 1.2?±?0.2, 5.3?±?0.6mM, respectively, and CiWM concentrations of 7.7?±?0.6, 4.9?±?0.5, 1.4?±?0.1 and 4.4?±?0.6mM, respectively. We showed that unaccounted voxel WM or GM partial volume can vary absolute quantification by 5?10% (more for ratios), which can often double the sample size required to establish statistical significance.

AB  - Background Extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma has been described in veterinary medicine in association with neoplasia, intervertebral disk disease, and snake envenomation. There are rare reports of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation with no known cause in human medicine. Multiple cases of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma have not been described previously in veterinary medicine. Objectives To describe the signalment, clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and surgical outcomes in histopathologically confirmed extraparenchymal spinal cord hematomas in dogs with no identified underlying etiology. Animals Six dogs had MRI of the spinal cord, decompressive spinal surgery, and histopathologic confirmation of extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma not associated with an underlying cause. Methods Multi-institutional retrospective study. Results Six patients had spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation. MRI showed normal signal within the spinal cord parenchyma in all patients. All hematomas had T2-weighted hyperintensity and the majority (5/6) had no contrast enhancement. All dogs underwent surgical decompression and most patients (5/6) returned to normal or near normal neurologic function postoperatively. Follow-up of the patients (ranging between 921 and 1,446 days) showed no progression of neurologic clinical signs or any conditions associated with increased bleeding tendency. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Before surgery and histopathology confirming extraparenchymal hematoma, the primary differential in most cases was neoplasia, based on the MRI findings. This retrospective study reminds clinicians of the importance of the combination of advanced imaging combined with histopathologic diagnosis. The prognosis for spontaneous spinal cord extraparenchymal hematoma with surgical decompression appears to be favorable in most cases.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - Spectral Imaging Microscopy (SIM) is a technique for performing image-enabled spectroscopic analysis using a standard light microscope. We employed a prototype to a current, commercially available, spectral imaging system (NuanceTM, CRI, Inc.) that electro-optically selects narrow bands of light to be collected by a cooled, monochrome CCD camera. For each sample, images were taken every 10?nm from 420?nm to 720?nm to create a spectral image ?stack.? Analysis of the images with a prototype to the Nuance TM Analyze software (CRI, Inc.) gave both standard color (RGB) and spectral information at each pixel of the images. A representative 40x field was spectrally imaged from H&E slides of 104 biopsy specimens of mycosis fungoides (MF). Optical densities and spectral properties of small lymphocytes were determined. Hyperchromatic cells were pseudocolored to show their distribution. In addition to the important architectural features of MF, SIM can define whether hyperchromatic or normochromatic small lymphocytes are epidermotropic in the lesion by setting appropriate threshold values. Hyperchromasia can be attributed to increased nuclear eosinophilia or basophilia. These differences are difficult to estimate by eye. Since lymphoblasts have enlarged nuclei with dispersed chromatin, a combination of spectral and spatial data is required for their analysis.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising cellular vehicle for gene therapy of malignant gliomas due to their property of tumor tropism. However, MSCs may show bidirectional and divergent effects on tumor growth. Therefore, a robust surveillance system with a capacity for noninvasive monitoring of the homing, distribution and fate of stem cells in vivo is highly desired for developing stem cell-based gene therapies for tumors. In this study, we used ferritin gene-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track the tumor tropism of MSCs in a rat orthotopic xenograft model of malignant glioma. MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Intra-arterial, intravenous and intertumoral injections of these FTH transgenic MSCs (FTH-MSCs) were performed in rats bearing intracranial orthotopic C6 gliomas. The FTH-MSCs were detected as hypointense signals on T2- and T2*-weighted images on a 3.0 T clinical MRI. After intra-arterial injection, 17% of FTH-MSCs migrated toward the tumor and gradually diffused throughout the orthotopic glioma. This dynamic process could be tracked in vivo by MRI up to 10 days of follow-up, as confirmed by histology. Moreover, the tumor tropism of MSCs showed no appreciable impact on the progression of the tumor. These results suggest that FTH reporter gene-based MRI can be used to reliably track the tropism and fate of MSCs after their systemic transplantation in orthotopic gliomas. This real-time in vivo tracking system will facilitate the future development of stem cell-based therapies for malignant gliomas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Procedural cooperation between cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist to facilitate interventions such as device delivery or angioplasty (hybrid procedure) has become increasingly common in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. Design.? Data were prospectively collected using a multicenter registry (C3PO). Between February 2007 and December 2008, seven institutions submitted data regarding 7019 cardiac catheterization procedures. Procedural data and adverse events (AEs) of 128 hybrid procedures were evaluated. Results.? There was significant variability in the number of hybrid procedures per center, ranging from one to 89 with a median of eight. A total of 60% of interventional (vs. strictly diagnostic) hybrid procedures were performed by one center. The median weight was 3.7?kg (0.7?86?kg). Single-ventricle circulation was present in 60% of the procedures. Hybrid procedures included: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement (n = 55), vascular rehabilitation (n = 25), ventricular septal defect (VSD) device closure (n = 7), valvotomy (n = 3), and diagnostic hybrid procedures (n = 38). Sixteen AEs occurred in 15/128 (12%) procedures. These included minor or trivial AEs (n = 9), moderate AEs (n = 5), major AEs (n = 1), and catastrophic AEs (n = 1). The type of AE documented included arrhythmias (n = 6), hypoxia or hypotension (n = 3), vessel or cardiac trauma (n = 2), and other events (n = 5). Of documented AEs, 9/16 (56%) were classified as not preventable, 6/16 (38%) as possibly preventable, and 1/16 (6%) as preventable. The incidence of AE related to PDA stent placement with surgical exposure (5/50, 10%) was significantly lower when compared with PDA stent placement performed percutaneously (4/5, 80%, P= .002). Conclusion.? Hybrid procedures appear to have a low incidence of associated major AEs. PDA stent placement performed as a palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or complex single/two ventricle patients may have a lower incidence of AEs if performed using a direct approach with surgical exposure rather than a percutaneous approach. Accurate definitions of these innovative procedures are required to facilitate prospective data collection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Continuous maturation of cerebral white matter (WM) in the postadolescent period is not fully understood. To elucidate the time course and location of possible postadolescent maturational changes in cerebral WM, we studied 60 healthy male subjects who were in their second to seventh decade using diffusion-weighted imaging. Mean diffusivity (MD) in subcortical WM was measured in 78 cortical regions in each subject's brain using an automated method. Regression analysis was used to model the age-related change in MD by either a linear or a quadratic function in each region. Age-related changes in subcortical MD were best modeled by either a linear function or a quadratic function in 27 regions including language-related regions, visual or multimodal areas in the bilateral occipital and temporal lobes, limbic areas including the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, and the bilateral postcentral and left precentral gyri. In these regions, the MD rapidly decreased until middle age and thereafter reached a plateau. Our results revealed microstructural changes in local subcortical WM and suggests a continuing maturational process in postoadolescent periods. Hum Brain Mapp 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Abstract Haematuria is a sign that can arise from a constellation of disorders, ranging from urinary tract infection to invasive malignancy. The authors review imaging modalities for the investigation of haematuria and highlight how imaging is key to the exclusion of potentially serious causative aetiologies.
