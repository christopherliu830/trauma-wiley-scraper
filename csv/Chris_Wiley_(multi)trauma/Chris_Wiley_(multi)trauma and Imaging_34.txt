AB  - Abstract Background and aims Resilience and recovery are of increasing importance in the field of alcohol dependence (AD). This paper describes how imaging studies in man can be used to assess the neurobiological correlates of resilience and, if longitudinal, of disease trajectories, progression rates and markers for recovery to inform treatment and prevention options. Methods Original papers on recovery and resilience in alcohol addiction and its neurobiological correlates were identified from PubMed and have been analyzed and condensed within a systematic literature review. Results Findings deriving from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have identified links between increased resilience and less task-elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia, and benefits of heightened neural pre-frontal cortex (PFC) engagement regarding resilience in a broader sense; namely, resilience against relapse in early abstinence of AD. Furthermore, findings consistently propose at least partial recovery of brain glucose metabolism and executive and general cognitive functioning, as well as structural plasticity effects throughout the brain of alcohol-dependent patients during the course of short-, medium- and long-term abstinence, even when patients only lowered their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. Additionally, specific factors were found that appear to influence these observed brain recovery processes in AD, e.g. genotype-dependent neuronal (re)growth, gender-specific neural recovery effects, critical interfering effects of psychiatric comorbidities, additional smoking or marijuana influences or adolescent alcohol abuse. Conclusions Neuroimaging research has uncovered neurobiological markers that appear to be linked to resilience and improved recovery capacities that are furthermore influenced by various factors such as gender or genetics. Consequently, future system-oriented approaches may help to establish a broad neuroscience-based research framework for alcohol dependence.

AB  - Canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. A retrospective study was undertaken of all dogs that were presented between January 1999 and January 2004 to the Animal Health Trust for the treatment of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Five cases were identified, and their median survival time was 211 days (95 per cent confidence interval 80 to 352) with two of the five dogs remaining alive at the end of the study, 826 and 1628 days from diagnosis with no clinical signs of disease. The protocol was well tolerated with only one of the five dogs showing toxicity associated with carboplatin and all dogs that started radiotherapy completing it. Compared with results of previous studies, these cases suggest that surgical cytoreduction followed by coarse fractionated radiotherapy together with carboplatin may be a useful way to treat this tumour. Carboplatin alone caused partial remission in the two cases where it was used as neo-adjunctive therapy.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of multi-family therapy at reducing the addiction severity and at improving the psychological and family dynamics of opiate addicts receiving methadone treatment at a public treatment center. The study compares multi-family therapy with a reflecting team (MFT-RT) and a standard treatment following a methadone maintenance treatment program. The results show that multi-family therapy with a reflecting team effectively reduces the addiction severity in several of the areas evaluated and noted that this effect is superior to standard treatment. The psychotherapy patients showed improvement in the areas of employment and social support; their drug use diminished and their psychiatric condition improved. At the same time, they needed a lower daily dose of methadone. In addition, the group undergoing standard treatment showed a noteworthy deterioration in their medical condition. Both groups showed a significant increase in their alcohol use. When applied to family treatments, the systemic-constructivist approach by the reflecting team offers combined techniques that can help improve care for the families of patients with addiction problems.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims The gold standard procedure after a severe nerve injury is the nerve autograft, yet this technique has drawbacks. In recent years, progress has been made in the development of artificial nerve guides to replace the autograft, but no device has been able to demonstrate superiority. The present study introduces an adaptable foundation design for peripheral nerve regeneration. Methods Silk fibroin was electrospun, creating a tri-layered material with aligned fiber surfaces and a randomly deposited fiber interior. This material was rolled into a micro-channeled conduit, which was then enveloped by a jacket layer of the same tri-layered material. Results The proposed implant design succeeds in incorporating various desirable aspects of synthetic nerve guides, while facilitating the surgical implantation process for medical application. The aligned fiber surfaces of the conduit support axon guidance, while the tri-layered architecture improves its structural integrity compared with a fully aligned fiber material. Moreover, the jacket layer creates a small niche on each end which facilitates surgical implantation. An in vivo study in rats showed that nerve regeneration using this device was comparable to results after direct suture. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study, therefore, advances the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts by creating an optimized guidance conduit design capable of successful nerve regeneration.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated but permission was given for post mortem examination and the use of materials in research.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic stream-lined approach could be routinely used in the evaluation of the fetal intracranal anatomy, and which could be used to effectively and efficiently exclude all major intracranial malformation. Three planes were determined to be independent without overlay. Following the establishment of these three independent oblique planes across the intracranial anatomy, there were applied clinically to determine whether such planes would be sufficient to diagnose the major intracranial abnormalities. After retrospectively examining the various imaging levels taken, it was independently determined that three levels of intracranial imaging provided the greatest anatomic view of the entire fetal brain: the lateral ventricular level (Level I); the medial-thalamic level (Level II); and the inferior-posterior fossa view (Level III). We examined 131 cases of intracranial abnormalities that were prenatally diagnosed between 14 and 24?weeks gestation. One investigator was given the three-level view protocol to determine if the anomalies could be identified using this system. It was determined that, of the 131 abnormal cases, 126 (96.2%) were diagnosed using Levels I, II or III, independently or in combination. There were no false-positive test results. The present study investigated the efficacy of a three level view (TLV) imaging of the fetal brain representing a complete 2-D examination. We found this approach to be applicable throughout pregnancy and suitable for visualization of normal intracranial structures as well as the identification of abnormalities.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Current imaging-based morphometric indicators of osteoarthritis (OA) using whole-compartment mean cartilage thickness (MCT) and volume changes can be insensitive to mild degenerative changes of articular cartilage (AC) due to areas of adjacent thickening and thinning. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate cartilage thickness-based surface roughness as a morphometric indicator of OA. 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were collected from osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) subjects with Kellgren?Lawrence (KL) OA grades of 0, 2, and 4 (n?=?10/group). Femoral and tibial AC volumes were converted to two-dimensional thickness maps, and MCT, arithmetic surface roughness (Sa), and anatomically normalized Sa (normSa) were calculated. Thickness maps enabled visualization of degenerative changes with increasing KL grade, including adjacent thinning and thickening on the femoral condyles. No significant differences were observed in MCT between KL grades. Sa was significantly higher in KL4 compared to KL0 and KL2 in the whole femur (KL0: 0.55?±?0.10?mm, KL2: 0.53?±?0.09?mm, KL4: 0.79?±?0.18?mm), medial femoral condyle (KL0: 0.42?±?0.07?mm, KL2: 0.48?±?0.07?mm, KL4: 0.76?±?0.22?mm), and medial tibial plateau (KL0: 0.42?±?0.07?mm, KL2: 0.43?±?0.09?mm, KL4: 0.68?±?0.27?mm). normSa was significantly higher in KL4 compared to KL0 and KL2 in the whole femur (KL0: 0.22?±?0.02, KL2: 0.22?±?0.02, KL4: 0.30?±?0.03), medial condyle (KL0: 0.17?±?0.02, KL2: 0.20?±?0.03, KL4: 0.29?±?0.06), whole tibia (KL0: 0.34?±?0.04, KL2: 0.33?±?0.05, KL4: 0.48?±?0.11) and medial plateau (KL0: 0.23?±?0.03, KL2: 0.24?±?0.04, KL4: 0.40?±?0.10), and significantly higher in KL2 compared to KL0 in the medial femoral condyle. Surface roughness metrics were sensitive to degenerative morphologic changes, and may be useful in OA characterization and early diagnosis. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective To report on a large multi-institutional series of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) partial nephrectomy (PN) and analyse renal function and short-term oncological outcomes. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive cases of LESS-PN performed between November 2007 and March 2012 at 11 participating institutions. Demographic data and data on the main peri-operative outcomes and complications were gathered and analysed. Kidney function was evaluated by measuring serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Chronic kidney disease was defined in stages for each patient according to the National Kidney Foundation, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. Results A total of 190 cases were included in this analysis. The mean renal tumour size was 2.6?cm, and the mean PADUA score was 7.2. The median operating time was 170?min with a median estimated blood loss of 150?mL. A clampless technique was used in 70 cases (36.8%) and the median warm ischaemia time (WIT) was 16.5?min. PADUA score independently predicted the length of WIT (low vs high score: odds ratio 5.11, CI 1.50?17.41, P = 0.009; intermediate vs high score: odds ratio 5.13, CI 1.56?16.88, P = 0.007). The overall postoperative complication rate was 14.7%. Where a clamping technique was used, a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration and a significant decrease in eGFR were observed postoperatively and at 6 months. On multivariate analysis PADUA score was the only predicting factor. Overall survival rates were 99, 97 and 88% at 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up, respectively, while disease-free survival rates were 98% at 12-month and 97% at 24- and 36-month follow-up. Conclusion The study showed that LESS-PN is effective in terms of renal function preservation and oncological control at short- and intermediate-term follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Diagnosing high intracranial pressure by clinical and diagnostic imaging is particularly challenging for chronic or slow-growing lesions. The aim of this prospective case-control study is to determine whether the neuroscore and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are related to the direct measurement of intracranial pressure in sheep affected by intracranial slow-growing lesions due to chronic cerebral coenurosis (Coenurus cerebralis). Seventeen affected and 10 control sheep were included. All animals underwent a neurological examination, MRI of the brain, and direct measurement of intracranial pressure. The severity of clinical signs and MRI findings were scored. Data were statistically analyzed. The invasive intracranial pressure value was higher in affected animals. A severely altered neuroscore is related to an increased intracranial pressure beyond the normal threshold (P < 0.05). The volume of the calvarium was larger in affected animals than in control animals (P = 0.0001) and was positively influenced by the presence and volume of the parasitic cyst (r = 0.7881, P < 0.01). Several degrees of deviation and deformation of both the ventricular system and brain parenchyma were detected by MRI. Subjective MRI findings were not associated with intracranial hypertension. In conclusion, this study shows that in sheep affected by slow-growing lesions, severe alterations in the neuroscore and the results of objective MRI are related to an increased intracranial pressure beyond the normal threshold.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.

AB  - Mastectomy, body image and therapeutic massage: a qualitative study of women's experience Despite the wealth of literature concerning the impact of breast loss on a woman's body image, sexual and psychological adjustment, there have been few studies within the medical and nursing literature directly quoting a woman's private perspective; how in her words she experiences her changed body. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions for addressing the problem of altered body image (ABI); healthcare professionals often feel at a loss in knowing how to help women cope ( Hopwood  a second phase piloted a massage intervention as a means of helping them adjust to living with their changed body image. Listening to their experience, in combination with the therapeutic massage, allowed deep access and insight into the nature of the women's trauma. The experiences of the three women in this study suggest there may be a group of women whose needs are overlooked and who, despite their prosthesis and reassurances that they are disease-free, opt to conceal the problems they have in living with a changed image. The availability of a body-centred therapy might help with certain aspects of adjustment as revealed by this study.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - This review defines terms such as accuracy, validity, and reliability, which are used to describe the quality of methods for taking x-rays and for analyzing digital images. Values for these parameters are described for techniques of taking standardized x-rays such as ear-rod fixation and fixation by use of teeth with a dental impression. In addition, values are given for linear measurements on digitized images and for quantitative image subtraction. Differences are addressed between quantitative subtraction with a reference ramp and relative subtraction using the computer-assisted densitometric image analysis (CADIA) system. The relationship between radiographic bone height and clinical attachment level is also discussed. Finally, present and future use in the periodontal office of linear radiographic measurements on digital images and digital subtraction is discussed. J Periodontol 2000;71:497-503.

AB  - Summary The knee is the largest and most complex joint in the body and a wide variety of bone and soft tissue injuries are seen in the knee. Trauma to the knee can result in injury to the bone, articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments. Fractures of the proximal tibia, particularly those that extend into the knee joint, are serious injuries that frequently result in functional impairment. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have given this modality a prominent role in the detection and classification of fractures in and around the knee. With the advent of high-performance multi-detector CT, isotropic data sets can be generated with subsecond gantry rotation times and submillimetre slice thickness. CT arthrography can clearly demonstrate many lesions in the plethora of internal derangement of the knee. CT arthrography also deserves its advantage as it may be used to evaluate knee injuries in patients where magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. In this article we discuss the indications for imaging of knee injuries by CT, present the advantages of multi-detector CT and CT arthrography, and provide examples that highlight the utility of CT in the evaluation of the knee injuries.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are compared for the evaluation of patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). MRI with gadolinium administration is the current gold standard for identifying retrocochlear lesions causing asymmetric SNHL. The study seeks to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ABR in screening for possible retrocochlear pathology. Most important among SNHL etiologies are neoplastic lesions such as vestibular schwannomas, cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors, as well as multiple sclerosis, stroke, or other rare nonneoplastic causes. The study results will allow the author to recommend a screening algorithm for patients with asymmetric SNHL. Study Design: The study is a multi-institutional, institutional review board approved, prospective, nonrandomized comparison of ABR and MRI for the evaluation of patients with asymmetric SNHL. Methods: Three hundred twelve patients (between the ages of 18 and 87) with asymmetric SNHL completed the study. Asymmetric SNHL was defined as 15 dB or greater asymmetry in two or more frequencies or 15% or more asymmetry in speech discrimination scores (SDS). These patients prospectively underwent both ABR and MRI. The ABR and MRI were interpreted independently in a blinded fashion. In addition to the ABR and MRI results, a variety of clinical and demographic data were collected. Results: Thirty-one (9.94%) patients of the study population of 312 were found on MRI to have lesions causing their SNHL. Of the 31 patients with causative lesions on MRI there were 24 vestibular schwannomas, 2 glomus jugulare tumors, 2 ectatic basilar arteries with brainstem compression, 1 petrous apex cholesterol granuloma, 1 case of possible demyelinating disease, and 1 parietal lobe mass. Twenty-two of the 31 patients had abnormal ABRs, whereas 9 patients (7 with small vestibular schwannomas) had normal ABRs. This gives an overall false-negative rate for ABR of 29%. The false-positive rate was found to be 76.84%. Sensitivity of ABR as a screening test was 71%, and specificity was 74%. Conclusions: Ten percent of patients with asymmetric SNHL (by this study's criteria) are likely to have causative lesions found on MRI. Although the recently reported annual incidence of vestibular schwannoma in the general population is 0.00124%, for patients with asymmetric SNHL in this study, the incidence was 7.7% (nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher). ABR has been demonstrated to have low sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of these patients and cannot be relied on as a screening test for patients with asymmetric SNHL. Keeping the use of MRI conditional on the results of ABR will annually result in missed or delayed diagnosis of causative lesions in 29 patients per 1,000 screened. The author recommends abandoning ABR as a screening test for asymmetric SNHL and adoption of a focused MRI protocol as the screening test of choice (within certain guidelines).
