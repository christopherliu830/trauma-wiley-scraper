AB  - Background and Objective Investigations have shown that pulsed lasers tuned to 6.1?µm in wavelength are capable of ablating ocular and neural tissue with minimal collateral damage. This study investigated whether a miniature B-scan forward-imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT) probe can be combined with the laser to provide real-time visual feedback during laser incisions. Study Design/Methods and Materials A miniature 25-gauge B-scan forward-imaging OCT probe was developed and combined with a 250?µm hollow-glass waveguide to permit delivery of 6.1?µm laser energy. A gelatin mixture and both porcine corneal and retinal tissues were simultaneously imaged and lased (6.1?µm, 10?Hz, 0.4?0.7?mJ) through air. The ablation studies were observed and recorded in real time. The crater dimensions were measured using OCT imaging software (Bioptigen, Durham, NC). Histological analysis was performed on the ocular tissues. Results The combined miniature forward-imaging OCT and mid-infrared laser-delivery probe successfully imaged real-time tissue ablation in gelatin, corneal tissue, and retinal tissue. Application of a constant number of 60 pulses at 0.5?mJ/pulse to the gelatin resulted in a mean crater depth of 123?±?15?µm. For the corneal tissue, there was a significant correlation between the number of pulses used and depth of the lased hole (Pearson correlation coefficient?=?0.82; P?=?0.0002). Histological analysis of the cornea and retina tissues showed discrete holes with minimal thermal damage. Conclusions A combined miniature OCT and laser-delivery probe can monitor real-time tissue laser ablation. With additional testing and improvements, this novel instrument has the future possibility of effectively guiding surgeries by simultaneously imaging and ablating tissue. Lasers Surg.

AB  - 19F MRI and optical imaging are two powerful noninvasive molecular imaging modalities in biomedical applications. 19F MRI has great potential for high resolution in vivo imaging, while fluorescent probes enable ultracontrast cellular/tissue imaging with high accuracy and sensitivity. A bimodal nanoprobe is developed, integrating the merits of 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging into a single synthetic molecule, which is further engineered into nanoprobe, by addressing shortcomings of conventional contrast agents to explore the quantitative 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging and cell tracking. Results show that this bimodal imaging nanoprobe presents high correlation of 19F MR signal and NIR fluorescence intensity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this nanoprobe enables quantitative 19F MR analysis, confirmed by a complementary fluorescence analysis. This unique feature can hardly be obtained by traditional 19F MRI contrast agents. It is envisioned that this nanoprobe can hold great potential for quantitative and sensitive multi-modal molecular imaging.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Disentangling the putative impact of cannabis on brain morphology from other comorbid substance use is critical. After controlling for the effects of nicotine, alcohol and multi-substance use, this study aimed to determine whether frequent cannabis use is associated with significantly smaller subcortical grey matter volumes. Design Exploratory analyses using mixed linear models, one per region of interest (ROI), were performed whereby individual differences in volume (outcome) at seven subcortical ROIs were regressed onto cannabis and comorbid substance use (predictors). Setting Two large population-based twin samples from the United States and Australia. Participants A total of 622 young Australian adults [66% female; ?age = 25.9, standard deviation SD) = 3.6] and 474 middle-aged US males (?age = 56.1SD = 2.6) of predominately Anglo-Saxon ancestry with complete substance use and imaging data. Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury were excluded. Measurements Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and volumetric segmentation methods were used to estimate volume in seven subcortical ROIs: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Substance use measurements included maximum nicotine and alcohol use, total life-time multi-substance use, maximum cannabis use in the young adults and regular cannabis use in the middle-aged males. Findings After correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.007), cannabis use was unrelated to any subcortical ROI. However, maximum nicotine use was associated with significantly smaller thalamus volumes in middle-aged males. Conclusions In exploratory analyses based on young adult and middle-aged samples, normal variation in cannabis use is unrelated statistically to individual differences in brain morphology as measured by subcortical volume.

AB  - Abstract Background Voice changes after thyroidectomy are common but not always related to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. We evaluated if RLN neuromonitoring correlated with non-RLN injury-related changes in voice after thyroidectomy. Methods Prospective multi-dimensional voice assessment was conducted on patients undergoing thyroidectomy before, 1?4 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Voice outcome (VO) was determined as normal (NormVO) or negative (NegVO) based upon combinations of patient-reported symptoms, videolaryngoscopy, a composite of acoustic measurements, and clinician-perceived voice quality. Groups with and without neuromonitoring were compared for early and durable differences in VO. Results Ninety-one patients underwent thyroidectomy; 39 with RLN neuromonitoring and 52 without. The two study groups were similar with regard to baseline characteristics including voice assessment. There was no difference in NegVO between neuromonitored and non-monitored patients at 1?4 weeks (n?=?89; 32% vs. 27%; P?=?0.81) and 6 months (n?=?71, 14% vs. 7%; P?=?0.42) after thyroidectomy. Neuromonitoring was associated with a 48-min increase in median operative time, but this finding was not statistically significant in a multivariate model. Conclusion In this study, recurrent laryngeal neuromonitoring did not appear to influence non-RLN injury related VO as measured by a comprehensive multidimensional voice assessment. J. Surg.

AB  - Understanding early differential response of brain during whole body radiation or cranial radiation exposure is of significant importance for better injury management during accidental or intentional exposure to ionizing radiation. We investigated the early microstructural and metabolic profiles using in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) following whole body and cranial radiation exposure of 8 Gy in mice using a 7.0 T animal MRI system and compared profiles with sham controls at days 1, 3, 5 and 10 post irradiation. A significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) values was found in hippocampus, thalamic and hypothalamic regions (p?<?0.05) in both whole body and cranial irradiated groups compared with controls, suggesting radiation induced reactive astrogliosis or neuroinflammatory response. In animals exposed to whole body radiation, FA was significantly decreased in some additional brain regions such as sensory motor cortex and corpus callosum in comparison with cranial irradiation groups and controls. Changes in FA were observed till day 10 post irradiation in both the groups. However, MRS study from hippocampus revealed changes only in the whole body radiation dose group. Significant reduction in the ratios of the metabolites myoinositol (mI, p?=?0.02) and taurine (tau, p?=?0.03) to total creatine were observed, and these metabolic alterations persisted till day 10 post irradiation. To the best of our knowledge this study has for the first time documented a comparative account of microstructural and metabolic aspects of whole body and cranial radiation induced early brain injury using in vivo MRI. Overall our findings suggest differential response at microstructure and metabolite levels following cranial or whole body radiation exposure. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.

AB  - Abstract Objective Because the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) transverse relaxation time (T2) of cartilage is sensitive to organization of collagen fibers in the cartilage, it may be a noninvasive image marker for senescent changes in cartilage collagen and early cartilage degeneration. The purpose of this study was to determine age-dependent differences in cartilage T2 values in healthy asymptomatic women. Methods Quantitative T2 maps of patellar cartilage from 30 asymptomatic women ages 22?86 years were obtained using a 3.0T MRI scanner. The study population was stratified by age into 4 cohorts: 18?30, 31?45, 46?65, and 66?86 years. Spatial differences in cartilage T2 were determined as a function of normalized distance from bone. Older groups were compared with the 18?30-year-old group to determine the effects of age on cartilage T2 values. Regions were considered statistically significantly different if the mean T2 values between groups differed at P < 0.05. Results Mean cartilage T2 profiles were nearly identical for the 2 youngest cohorts. Compared with the 18?30-year-old group, T2 values were statistically significantly longer in the superficial 40% of cartilage in the 46?65-year-old group and over the entire cartilage thickness in the 66?86-year-old group. Conclusion The location of T2 elevations in women over the age of 45 years is consistent with the theory that senescent changes of cartilage collagen begin near the articular surface and progress to the deeper cartilage with advancing age.

AB  - Abstract Chronic abuse of cocaine or alcohol is associated with structural, neuropathological and cognitive impairments that have been documented extensively. Little is known, however, about neurobiochemical changes in chronic substance abusers.We performed MRI and multi-slice brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to assess neuronal viability (via N-acetylaspartate (NAA)) and white matter metabolite status in 22 4-months-abstinent individuals dependent on crack cocaine only and on both crack cocaine and alcohol. Compared to 11 non-dependent controls we found (1) significantly lower NAA measures in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the combined cocaine-dependent groups; (2) comparable spatial distribution and magnitude of these NAA effects for both cocaine-dependent groups; (3) higher choline-containing metabolites in frontal white matter of individuals dependent on both cocaine and alcohol; (4) absence of brain atrophy in both abstinent cocaine-dependent samples; and (5) partial recovery from prefrontal cortical NAA loss, primarily with abstinence from alcohol. The MRSI findings suggest preferential neuronal damage to the frontal cortex of both cocaine-dependent samples and gliosis in frontal white matter of individuals dependent on both alcohol and cocaine, conditions that persist for more than 4 months of abstinence.

AB  - Summary Background Few noninvasive methods are available for equine hoof wall evaluation. The highly organised wall structures and composition of proteoglycans and collagens may make this region amenable to quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques of T1? and T2 mapping to identify pathology related to proteoglycan content and collagen organisation respectively. Objective To establish normative T1? and T2 values of the equine hoof wall of 3-year-old Quarter Horses with histological comparison. Study design Cadaveric anatomical study. Methods Six cadaveric left thoracic feet from 3-year-old racing Quarter Horses with no reported lameness were evaluated using T1? and T2 mapping. Mapping was performed at six regions of interest at the toe of each hoof including proximal and distal regions of the inner epidermis, stratum lamellatum and corium. Histology was evaluated for standard hoof morphology and proteoglycan staining. Results T2 values of the stratum lamellatum and corium were similar (42.9 [95% CI: 41.6?44.2] ms and 44 [95% CI: 42.7?45.3] ms respectively), but both were significantly different to the inner epidermis (35.8 [95% CI: 34.5?37.1] ms, P<0.001). T1? values for the inner epidermis, stratum lamellatum and corium were significantly different (25.1 [95% CI: 23.1?27.1] ms, 44.4 [95% CI: 42.4?46.4] ms and 50.1 [95% CI: 48.1?52.1] ms, respectively, P<0.001). Histology demonstrated normal organised morphology. Proteoglycan staining was only visible in the stratum lamellatum and corium. Main limitations Cadaveric study with frozen samples used. Conclusions Variation of qMRI metrics through the depth of the equine hoof wall was found. Although the highly ordered environment of collagen may contribute to T2 values, there was lack of evidence to support proteoglycan content as a major contributor of T1? values. It is possible T1? values had a greater dependence on total water content as the lowest values were seen in the epidermis. Additional research using qMRI is needed to determine mapping values in different disease states.

Conclusions Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent and clinically highly heterogeneous neurological disorder with large socioeconomic consequences. TBI severity classification, based on the hospital admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ranges from mild (GCS 13?15) and moderate (GCS 9?12) to severe (GCS ≤ 8). The GCS reflects the risk of dying from TBI, which is low after mild (?1%), intermediate after moderate (up to 15%) and high (up to 40%) after severe TBI. Intracranial damage can be focal, such as epidural and subdural haematomas and parenchymal contusions, or diffuse, for example traumatic axonal injury and diffuse cerebral oedema, although this distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Study of the cellular and molecular post-traumatic processes is essential for the understanding of TBI pathophysiology but even more to find therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs to be eventually used in human beings. To date, studies in vitro and in vivo, mainly in animals but also in human beings, are unravelling the pathological TBI mechanisms at high pace. Nevertheless, TBI pathophysiology is all but completely elucidated. Neuroprotective treatment studies in human beings have been disappointing thus far and have not resulted in commonly accepted drugs. This review presents an overview on the clinical aspects and the pathophysiology of focal and diffuse TBI, and it highlights several acknowledged important events that occur on molecular and cellular level after TBI.

AB  - Abstract Desmoid type fibromatosis is an uncommon benign disease entity of which its etiology is currently unknown. It constitutes 0.3% of all solid neoplasms, but it is rarely seen in the breast and even more scarcely reported to develop in association with breast implant. We present ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 29-year-old female patient with fibromatosis after breast implant surgery. Knowledge of imaging findings of breast fibromatosis associated with implant will be helpful for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

AB  - Abstract Background Previous studies have documented differences in neural activation during language processing in individuals with Down syndrome (DS) in comparison with typically developing individuals matched for chronological age. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation during language processing in young adults with DS to typically developing comparison groups matched for chronological age or mental age. We hypothesised that the pattern of neural activation in the DS cohort would differ when compared with both typically developing cohorts. Method Eleven persons with DS (mean chronological age?=?18.3; developmental age range?=?4?6 years) and two groups of typically developing individuals matched for chronological (n?=?13; mean age?=?18.3 years) and developmental (mental) age (n?=?12; chronological age range?=?4?6 years) completed fMRI scanning during a passive story listening paradigm. Random effects group comparisons were conducted on individual maps of the contrast between activation (story listening) and rest (tone presentation) conditions. Results Robust activation was seen in typically developing groups in regions associated with processing auditory information, including bilateral superior and middle temporal lobe gyri. In contrast, the DS cohort demonstrated atypical spatial distribution of activation in midline frontal and posterior cingulate regions when compared with both typically developing control groups. Random effects group analyses documented reduced magnitude of activation in the DS cohort when compared with both control groups. Conclusions Activation in the DS group differed significantly in magnitude and spatial extent when compared with chronological and mental age-matched typically developing control groups during a story listening task. Results provide additional support for an atypical pattern of functional organisation for language processing in this population.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (which acquires data as a volume, instead of a series of planes, eliminating gating) to evaluate fetal cardiac anatomy and function. We evaluated 10 human fetuses including several with congenital heart disease. Transabdominal scanning was performed using a real-time three-dimensional echocardiography system. Four 1.5 second volume clips at 20 volumes/second were obtained for each fetal heart and stored for off-line analysis. Data were reviewed on a graphics workstation. Our results showed that fetal heart data could be acquired rapidly. Fetal heart data were displayed as 3 simultaneous planes. The reviewer could manipulate plane orientation and position in the volume to optimize views. Cardiac motion could be accelerated, slowed, stopped or viewed at its original speed. Although image quality did not equal high-end equipment, cardiac structures, views and function could be consistently visualized. Abnormal structures were readily detected. In conclusion, real-time three-dimensional fetal echocardiography is a feasible and potentially important new technique that will gain importance as equipment performance improves.

AB  - Purpose As deep neural networks achieve more success in the wide field of computer vision, greater emphasis is being placed on the generalizations of these models for production deployment. With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security measures and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity. Methods In this paper, we implement cyclic weight transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multisite learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions. Results The MSL model attains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0.914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0.646 and average correlation of 0.871. Conclusions We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.
