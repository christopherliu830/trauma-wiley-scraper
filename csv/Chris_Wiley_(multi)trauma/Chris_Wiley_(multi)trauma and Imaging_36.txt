AB  - Abstract Membrane lesions play an early role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Using a new albumin-targeted contrast agent (MS-325), sarcolemmal integrity of two animal models for muscular dystrophy was studied by MRI. Intravenously injected MS-325 does not enter skeletal muscle of normal mice. However, mdx and Sgca-null mutant mice, animal models for Duchenne and sarcoglycan-deficient limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, respectively, showed significant accumulation of MS-325 in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that contrast agent-enhanced MRI could serve as a common, noninvasive imaging procedure for evaluating the localization, extent, and mechanisms of skeletal muscle damage in muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, this method is expected to facilitate assessment of therapeutic approaches in these diseases. Magn Reson Med 44:655?659, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Conventional diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI suffers from free water contamination due to the finite voxel size. The most common case of free water contamination occurs with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in voxels located at the CSF-tissue interface, such as at the ventricles in the human brain. Another case refers to intra-tissue free water as in vasogenic oedema. In order to avoid the bias in diffusion metrics, several multi-compartment methods have been introduced, which explicitly model the presence of a free water compartment. However, fitting multi-compartment models in DW MRI represents a well known ill conditioned problem. Although during the last decade great effort has been devoted to mitigating this estimation problem, the research field remains active. The aim of this work is to introduce the design, characterise the NMR properties and demonstrate the use of two dedicated anisotropic diffusion fibre phantoms, useful for the study of free water elimination (FWE) and mapping models. In particular, we investigate the recently proposed FWE diffusion tensor imaging approach, which takes explicit account of differences in the transverse relaxation times between the free water and tissue compartments.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed to determine the frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging and the need for emergency neurosurgery in children with normal mental status following a post-traumatic seizure (PTS). Methods We searched six electronic databases from inception to October 15, 2018, to identify studies including children under 18 years with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 after an immediate PTS. Relevant non-English articles were translated to determine eligibility. Results We performed random effect meta-analyses and assessed heterogeneity with I2. The pooled estimate of the frequency of TBI, from seven studies, was 13.0% (95% CI: 4.0?26.1; I2 = 81%). Data on the need of emergency neurosurgery were reported in four studies and the pooled estimate of its frequency was 2.3% (95% CI: 0.0?9.9; I2 = 86%). Two studies reported on children with isolated PTS without any other signs of head injury, representing 0.1% of patients in both studies, for a total of 76 children. Of these, only three had TBI and one underwent neurosurgery. Conclusion Children with immediate PTS and normal mental status frequently have TBI with a substantial need for neurosurgery. Clinicians should strongly consider neuroimaging for these children, although prolonged observation may be considered for those with isolated PTS.

AB  - Abstract High-field magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to study posterior fossa morphology in 27 patients with major depression and 36 normal control subjects. Depressed patients demonstrated smaller brain stem and cerebellar vermis than controls. These differences were highly significant for the anterior cerebellar vermis and medulla. There was also a striking age-related decline in midbrain size in depressed patients as well as in controls. Our results are consistent with several lines of evidence implicating a role for the cerebellar vermis in affective disorders and, in addition, provide the first MR documentation of the differential effects of aging on posterior fossa morphology in normal subjects compared with patients with major depression.

AB  - To be able to determine if endodontic treatment of apical pathosis is successful or not, healing of lesions is followed up by radiographic imaging. This can be done by observing changes in apical radiolucencies. Recently, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been introduced as a method of gaining an unabridged view of dental anatomy, thus eliminating some of the most prevalent problems, such as superimposition and distortion. CBCT reduces false diagnosis and is rapidly replacing other radiographic techniques in diagnosis, quality control of treatment methods and techniques, and outcome assessment. Healing assessment using conventional and newer three-dimensional imaging includes, but is not limited to, periapical osseous lesions, conditions of the maxillary sinus, status after endodontic surgery, hard tissue deposition in regeneration procedures, and horizontal root fractures. Due to a low predictive value of two-dimensional periapical radiographs to distinguish between periapical disease and health, future assessment of endodontic treatment efficacy may include 3D imaging from small field-of-view CBCT units.

AB  - Abstract Raman spectroscopy is an emerging technique in bioanalysis and imaging of biomaterials owing to its unique capability of generating spectroscopic fingerprints. Imaging cells and tissues by Raman microspectroscopy represents a nondestructive and label-free approach. All components of cells or tissues contribute to the Raman signals, giving rise to complex spectral signatures. Resonance Raman scattering and surface-enhanced Raman scattering can be used to enhance the signals and reduce the spectral complexity. Raman-active labels can be introduced to increase specificity and multimodality. In addition, nonlinear coherent Raman scattering methods offer higher sensitivities, which enable the rapid imaging of larger sampling areas. Finally, fiber-based imaging techniques pave the way towards in?vivo applications of Raman spectroscopy. This Review summarizes the basic principles behind medical Raman imaging and its progress since 2012.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to develop a diffusion tensor MR imaging pulse sequence that allows whole brain coverage with isotropic resolution within a clinically acceptable time. A single-shot, cardiac-gated MR pulse sequence, optimized for measuring the diffusion tensor in human brain, was developed to provide whole-brain coverage with isotropic (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) spatial resolution, within a total imaging time of approximately 15 min. The diffusion tensor was computed for each voxel in the whole volume and the data processed for visualization in three orthogonal planes. Anisotropy data were further visualized using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm. Finally, reconstruction of fiber-tract trajectories i.e., ?tractography? was performed. Images obtained with this pulse sequence provide clear delineation of individual white matter tracts, from the most superior cortical regions down to the cerebellum and brain stem. Because the data are acquired with isotropic resolution, they can be reformatted in any plane and the sequence can therefore be used, in general, for macroscopic neurological or psychiatric neuroimaging investigations. The 3D visualization afforded by maximum intensity projection imaging and tractography provided easy visualization of individual white matter fasciculi, which may be important sites of neuropathological degeneration or abnormal brain development. This study has shown that it is possible to obtain robust, high quality diffusion tensor MR data at 1.5 Tesla with isotropic resolution (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) from the whole brain within a sufficiently short imaging time that it may be incorporated into clinical imaging protocols.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Infrared thermal imaging (IRTI) is a new technique for detecting deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on DVT's infrared presentation and distribution characteristics (PDCs). A method that is singularly sensitive to DVT is needed. They, therefore, enrolled 157 subjects with suspected lower extremity DVT in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial using IRTI, and Doppler compression ultrasonography (CPUS) to verify the clinical value of IRTI. Methods An IRTI system could precisely measure and store real-time thermal images. A double-blind, controlled clinical study using IRTI and detection on 157 patients with suspected DVTs, evaluating the following parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive prescreening, negative prescreening, false positivity, false negativity, and diagnostic accordance of IRTI with CPUS for detecting DVT were conducted. Results Of 140 subjects who underwent screening both IRTI and CPUS detect were included for analyses. According to their IRTI DVT's presentation and distribution characteristics, patients were divided into IRTI- negative (n?=?59) and IRTI-positive (including suspicious IRTI positive) (n?=?81) groups. CPUS identified 80 DVT-negative and 60 DVT-positive patients. The sensitivity of IRTI for detecting DVT was 88.33%, specificity 65.00%, false-positive diagnosis 11.67%, false-negative diagnosis 35.00%, positive prescreening 65.43%, negative prescreening 88.14%, diagnostic accordance rate 75.00%. IRTI results accorded with CPUS results (P = .001) except for the positivity incidence (?2?=?39.997, P?<?.001). Conclusions IRTI could be used to supplement CPUS detection for detecting DVTs and adjunctive diagnostic screening.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.

AB  - Abstract Aim. To recognize epileptic spasms (ES) as a seizure type after traumatic brain injury (TBI), accidental or non-accidental, in infants and children. In the process, we aim to gain some insight into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in ES. Methods. A retrospective electronic chart review was performed at the Children's Hospital of Michigan from 2002 to 2012. Electronic charts of 321 patients were reviewed for evidence of post-traumatic epilepsy. Various clinical variables were collected including age at TBI, mechanism of trauma, severity of brain injury, electroencephalography/neuroimaging data, and seizure semiology. Results. Six (12.8%) of the 47 patients diagnosed with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) had ES. Epileptic spasms occurred between two months to two years after TBI. All patients with ES had multiple irritative zones, manifesting as multifocal epileptiform discharges, unilateral or bilateral. Cognitive delay and epileptic encephalopathy were seen in all six patients, five of whom were free of spasms after treatment with vigabatrin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Conclusion. The risk of PTE is 47/321(14.6%) and the specific risk of ES after TBI is 6/321 (1.8%). The risk of ES appears to be high if the age at which severe TBI occurred was during infancy. Non-accidental head trauma is a risk factor of epileptic spasms. While posttraumatic epilepsy (not ES) may start 10 years after the head injury, ES starts within two years, according to our small cohort. The pathophysiology of ES is unknown, however, our data support a combination of previously proposed models in which the primary dysfunction is a focal or diffuse cortical abnormality, coupled with its abnormal interaction with the subcortical structures and brainstem at a critical maturation stage.

AB  - Abstract Integration of the neural processes in the human brain is realized through interconnections that exist between different neural centers. These interconnections take place through white matter pathways. White matter tractography is currently the only available technique for the reconstruction of the anatomical connectivity in the human brain noninvasively and in vivo. The trajectory and terminations of white matter pathways are estimated from local orientations of nerve bundles. These orientations are obtained using measurements of water diffusion in the brain. In this article, the techniques for estimating fiber directions from diffusion measurements in the human brain are reviewed. Methods of white matter tractography are described, together with the current limitations of the technique, including sensitivity to image noise and partial voluming. The applications of white matter tractography to the topographical characterization of the white matter connections and the segmentation of specific white matter pathways, and corresponding functional units of gray matter, are discussed. In this context, the potential impact of white matter tractography in mapping the functional systems and subsystems in the human brain, and their interrelations, is described. Finally, the applications of white matter tractography to the study of brain disorders, including fiber tract localization in brains affected by tumors and the identification of impaired connectivity routes in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases, are discussed.

AB  - Purpose To measure the transverse relaxation time T2* in healthy human cervical spinal cord gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) at 3T. Methods Thirty healthy volunteers were recruited. Axial images were acquired using an averaged multi-echo gradient-echo (mFFE) T2*-weighted sequence with 5 echoes. We used the signal equation for an mFFE sequence with constant dephasing gradients after each echo to jointly estimate the spin density and T2* for each voxel. Results No global difference in T2* was observed between all GM (41.3 ± 5.6 ms) and all WM (39.8 ± 5.4 ms). No significant differences were observed between left (43.2 ± 6.8 ms) and right (43.4 ± 5.5 ms) ventral GM, left (38.3 ± 6.1 ms) and right (38.6 ± 6.5 ms) dorsal GM, and left (39.4 ± 5.8 ms) and right (40.3 ± 5.8 ms) lateral WM. However, significant regional differences were observed between ventral (43.4 ± 5.7 ms) and dorsal (38.4 ± 6.0 ms) GM (p < 0.05), as well as between ventral (42.9 ± 6.5 ms) and dorsal (37.9 ± 6.2 ms) WM (p < 0.05). In analyses across slices, inferior T2* was longer than superior T2* in GM (44.7 ms vs. 40.1 ms; p < 0.01) and in WM (41.8 ms vs. 35.9 ms; p < 0.01). Conclusions Significant differences in T2* are observed between ventral and dorsal GM, ventral and dorsal WM, and superior and inferior GM and WM. There is no evidence for bilateral asymmetry in T2* in the healthy cord. These values of T2* in the spinal cord are notably lower than most reported values of T2* in the cortex.

AB  - Abstract We describe the case of a 35-year-old man who had suffered a severe multitrauma with blunt thoracic injury, left scapula and humerus fractures 5 years earlier. At the time of the trauma, a diaphragmatic lesion went unnoticed. Five years later, the patient had a 24-h history of increasingly severe abdominal pain with repeated vomiting. Helical CT showed a portion of the left hemidiaphragm avulsed from its insertions on the ribs with large-bowel loop obstruction herniated in the left hemithorax. The preoperative CT diagnosis was confirmed by surgery: reduction of the hernia and reinsertion of the hemidiaphragm to the lumbocostal arch were performed.

AB  - Abstract Theoretical models for lexical access to visual objects have been based mainly on adult data. To investigate the developmental aspects of object recognition and lexical access in children, a large-scale functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed in 283 normal children ages 5?18 using a word?picture matching paradigm in which children would match an aurally presented noun to one of two pictures (line drawings). Using group Independent Component Analysis (ICA), six task-related components were detected, including (a) the posterior superior temporal gyrus bilaterally; (b) the fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle occipital gyri bilaterally; (c) the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the left precuneus, the left superior/middle temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate; (d) the right medial fusiform gyrus; (e) a left-lateralized component including the inferior/middle frontal, middle temporal, medial frontal, and angular gyri, as well as the thalamus and the posterior cingulate; and (f) the ventral/anterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally. Increased activation associated with age was seen in the components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) for object recognition, and (c) and (f) likely associated with semantic maintenance and response selection. Increased activation associated with task performance was seen in components (b) and (d) (ventral visual pathway) while decreased activation associated with task performance was seen in component (f) (ventral/anterior inferior frontal gyrus). The results corroborate the continued development of the ventral visual pathway throughout the developmental period. Hum Brain Mapp 2006. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Accumulation of paired helical filament tau contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 18F-flortaucipir is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand sensitive to tau in AD, but its clinical utility will depend in part on its ability to predict cognitive symptoms in diverse dementia phenotypes associated with selective, regional uptake. We examined associations between 18F-flortaucipir and cognition in 14 mildly-impaired patients (12 with cerebrospinal fluid analytes consistent with AD pathology) who had amnestic (n?=?5) and non-amnestic AD syndromes, including posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, n?=?5) and logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA, n?=?4). Amnestic AD patients had deficits in memory; lvPPA in language; and both amnestic AD and PCA patients in visuospatial function. Associations with cognition were tested using sparse regression and compared to associations in anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). 18F-flortaucipir uptake was expected to show regionally-specific correlations with each domain. In multivariate analyses, uptake was elevated in neocortical areas specifically associated with amnestic and non-amnestic syndromes. Uptake in left anterior superior temporal gyrus accounted for 67% of the variance in language performance. Uptake in right lingual gyrus predicted 85% of the variance in visuospatial performance. Memory was predicted by uptake in right fusiform gyrus and cuneus as well as a cluster comprising right anterior hippocampus and amygdala; this eigenvector explained 57% of the variance in patients' scores. These results provide converging evidence for associations between 18F-flortaucipir uptake, tau pathology, and patients' cognitive symptoms.
