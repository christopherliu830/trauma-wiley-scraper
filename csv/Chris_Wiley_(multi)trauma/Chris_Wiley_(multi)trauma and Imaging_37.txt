AB  - Abstract A perilymphatic fistula (PLF) is an abnormal communication between the inner and middle ear resulting in vestibular or cochlear symptoms. We review three pediatric traumatic temporal bone fractures with pneumolabyrinth, confirmed radiologically by the presence of air within the cochlea (pneumocochlea) or vestibule (pneumovestibule). Patients were treated conservatively with complete resolution of vestibulopathy. Hearing outcome was variable and worse in two patients with pneumocochlea. A pneumolabyrinth on radiologic imaging confirms a PLF and obviates the need for exploration to reach a diagnosis. We suggest exploration be reserved for patients with persisting cerebrospinal fluid leakage, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, or vestibular symptomatology. Laryngoscope, 2011

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The regrowth of amputated appendage extremities and the distal tips of digits represent models of tissue regeneration in multiple vertebrate taxa. In humans, digit tip injuries, including traumatic amputation and crush injuries, are among the most common type of injury to the human hand. Despite clinical reports demonstrating natural regeneration of appendages in lower vertebrates and human digits, current treatment options are suboptimal, and are complicated by the anatomical complexities and functions of the different tissues within the digits. Results: In light of these challenges, we focus on recent advancements in understanding appendage regeneration from model organisms. We pay special attention to the cellular programs underlying appendage regeneration, where cumulative data from salamanders, fish, frogs, and mice indicate that regeneration occurs by the actions of lineage-restricted precursors. We focus on pathologic states and the interdependency that exists, in both humans and animal models, between the nail organ and the peripheral nerves for successful regeneration. Conclusions: The increased understanding of regeneration in animal models may open new opportunities for basic and translational research aimed at understanding the mechanisms that support limb regeneration, as well as amelioration of limb abnormalities and pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Acquisition of multimodal brain imaging data for the same subject has become more common leading to a growing interest in determining the intermodal relationships between imaging modalities to further elucidate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Multimodal data have previously been individually analyzed and subsequently integrated; however, these analysis techniques lack the ability to examine true modality inter-relationships. The utilization of a multiset canonical correlation and joint independent component analysis (mCCA?+?jICA) model for data fusion allows shared or distinct abnormalities between modalities to be examined. In this study, first-episode schizophrenia patients (nSZ=19) and matched controls (nHC=21) completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan at 7 T. Grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used as features in a mCCA?+?jICA model. Results of the mCCA?+?jICA model indicated three joint group-discriminating components (GM-CSF, WM-ALFF, GM-ALFF) and two modality-unique group-discriminating components (GM, WM). The joint component findings are highlighted by GM basal ganglia, somatosensory, parietal lobe, and thalamus abnormalities associated with ventricular CSF volume; WM occipital and frontal lobe abnormalities associated with temporal lobe function; and GM frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe abnormalities associated with caudate function. These results support and extend major findings throughout the literature using independent single modality analyses. The multimodal fusion of 7 T data in this study provides a more comprehensive illustration of the relationships between underlying neuronal abnormalities associated with schizophrenia than examination of imaging data independently.

AB  - Abstract Objective Yiqifumai injection is a compound Chinese medicine used to treat microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases clinically. Our previous study proved that Yiqifumai injection pretreatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced venular albumin leakage in rat mesentery. This study aimed to investigate whether Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability and corresponding contribution of its main ingredients. Methods Rats were challenged by lipopolysaccharide infusion (5 mg/kg/h) for 90 minutes. Yiqifumai injection (160 mg/kg/h), Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h), Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h), and Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h) + Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h) were infused 30 minutes before (pretreatment) or after (post-treatment) lipopolysaccharide administration. Results Both pretreatment and post-treatment with Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral venular albumin leakage during lipopolysaccharide infusion and cerebrovascular hyperpermeability at 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide infusion. Yiqifumai injection restrained the decreased junction protein expression, adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria complex I, II, IV, and V activities. Moreover, Yiqifumai injection inhibited toll-like receptor-4 expression, Src phosphorylation, and caveolin-1 expression. Its main ingredients Rb1 and Sch alone worked differently, with Rb1 being more effective for enhancing energy metabolism, while Sch attenuating toll-like receptor-4 expression and Src activation. Conclusion Yiqifumai injection exerts a protective and ameliorated effect on cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability, which is more effective than any of its ingredients, possibly due to the interaction of its main ingredients through a multi-pathway mode.

AB  - Abstract Laser-induced thermal effects in optically trapped microspheres and single cells are investigated by quantum dot luminescence thermometry. Thermal spectroscopy has revealed a non-localized temperature distribution around the trap that extends over tens of micrometers, in agreement with previous theoretical models besides identifying water absorption as the most important heating source. The experimental results of thermal loading at a variety of wavelengths reveal that an optimum trapping wavelength exists for biological applications close to 820 nm. This is corroborated by a simultaneous analysis of the spectral dependence of cellular heating and damage in human lymphocytes during optical trapping. This quantum dot luminescence thermometry demonstrates that optical trapping with 820 nm laser radiation produces minimum intracellular heating, well below the cytotoxic level (43 °C), thus, avoiding cell damage.

AB  - Background Smaller hippocampal volume in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features. Methods Case-control cross-sectional studies of U.S. military veterans (n = 282) from the Iraq and Afghanistan era were grouped into PTSD (n = 142) and trauma-exposed controls (n = 140). Participants underwent clinical evaluation for PTSD and associated clinical parameters followed by MRI at 3 T. Segmentation with FreeSurfer v6.0 produced hippocampal subfield volumes for the left and right CA1, CA3, CA4, DG, fimbria, fissure, hippocampus-amygdala transition area, molecular layer, parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, and tail, as well as hippocampal meshes. Covariates included age, gender, trauma exposure, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication use, total hippocampal volume, and MRI scanner model. Results Significantly lower subfield volumes were associated with PTSD in left CA1 (P = 0.01; d = 0.21; uncorrected), CA3 (P = 0.04; d = 0.08; uncorrected), and right CA3 (P = 0.02; d = 0.07; uncorrected) only if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume was included as a covariate. A trend level association of L-CA1 with PTSD (F4, 221 = 3.32, P = 0.07) is present and the other subfield findings are nonsignificant if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume is not included as a covariate. PTSD-associated differences in global hippocampal shape were nonsignificant. Conclusions The present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.

AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Objective? To describe the clinical presentation, ultrasound findings, management and outcome in horses with muscle tear injuries of the hindlimbs. Design? Retrospective case series Procedure? Medical records of eight horses were reviewed and information on signalment, history, presenting complaint, physical examination findings and further diagnostic tests were recorded. Diagnosis of muscle injury was determined by the presence of abnormal ultrasound findings, compared with the contralateral limb, and, when required, nuclear scintigraphy. Follow-up information was obtained via telephone interviews with owners, trainers and referring veterinarians. Results? Muscle tears causing lameness were identified in the middle gluteal (3), semitendinosus (1), semimembranosus (2) and gracilis (2) muscles. Tears were classified by ultrasound imaging as partial (6) or complete (2). The degree of lameness did not appear to be indicative of the extent of injury or of completion of healing. Long-term follow-up was available for seven horses and the outcome was favourable in six cases. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis and assessment of moderate to severe muscle strain injuries. The prognosis appears to be favourable in most cases, although recurrence of injury and lameness can delay the return to athletic activity and an inferior outcome with persistent gait abnormality may occur.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a method to obtain anatomical information from the brain in vivo that is not typically available by optical imaging because of this organ's opacity. MR is nondestructive and obtains deep tissue contrast with 100-µm3 voxel resolution or better. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) may be used to observe axonal transport and localized neural activity in the living rodent and avian brain. Such enhancement enables researchers to investigate differences in functional circuitry or neuronal activity in images of brains of different animals. Moreover, once MR images of a number of animals are aligned into a single matrix, statistical analysis can be done comparing MR intensities between different multi-animal cohorts comprising individuals from different mouse strains or different transgenic animals, or at different time points after an experimental manipulation. Although preprocessing steps for such comparisons (including skull stripping and alignment) are automated for human imaging, no such automated processing has previously been readily available for mouse or other widely used experimental animals, and most investigators use in-house custom processing. This protocol describes a stepwise method to perform such preprocessing for mouse. ? 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Abstract Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been specifically designed to produce undistorted three-dimensional information of the maxillofacial skeleton, including the teeth and their surrounding tissues with a significantly lower effective radiation dose compared with conventional computed tomography (CT). Periapical disease may be detected sooner using CBCT compared with periapical views and the true size, extent, nature and position of periapical and resorptive lesions can be assessed. Root fractures, root canal anatomy and the nature of the alveolar bone topography around teeth may be assessed. The aim of this paper is to review current literature on the applications and limitations of CBCT in the management of endodontic problems.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

AB  - Fully bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) represent a novel approach for the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery stenosis, providing temporary vessel scaffolding with drug-eluting capability during the restenosis-prone phase of the vascular healing. Beyond this initial critical period, when mechanical scaffolding support is no longer necessary, the device is bioresorbed, restoring the normal vascular physiology with the aim to eliminate the long-term safety concerns related to permanent metallic implants. Nonetheless, current BRS technology suffers from limited mechanical properties as compared to available metallic platforms, requiring careful attention to lesion preparation, accurate vessel sizing, and implantation technique. Intravascular imaging has played an important role in providing knowledge on the acute effects after BRS deployment, and it helped refine the current technique of BRS implantation. In addition, extensive work with multiple intravascular imaging modalities have also contributed to the understanding of the unique dynamic vascular changes that are experienced in the treated segment from post-implantation up to complete device bioresorption. In this manuscript, we review the role of invasive imaging modalities?from angiography to sound- and light-based techniques?to guide BRS implantation procedures, to assess its acute results postimplantation, and the changes experienced in the long-term until complete bioresorption has ensued. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord remain challenging due to the small cross-sectional size of the cord and susceptibility-related distortions. Although partially addressable through parallel imaging, few highly parallel array coils have been implemented for the cervical cord. Here, we developed a 32-channel coil that fully covers the brain and c-spine and characterized its performance in comparison with a commercially available head/neck/spine array. Image and temporal signal-to-noise ratio were, respectively, increased by 2? and 1.8? in the cervical cord. Averaged g-factors at 4? acceleration were lowered by 22% in the brain and by 39% in the spinal cord, enabling 1-mm isotropic R = 4 multi-echo magnetization prepared gradient echo of the full brain and c-spine in 3:20 min. Diffusion imaging of the cord at 0.6 ? 0.6 ? 5 mm3 resolution and tractography of the full brain and c-spine at 1.7-mm isotropic resolution were feasible without noticeable distortion. Improvements of this nature potentially enhance numerous basic and clinical research studies focused on spinal and supraspinal regions. Magn Reson Med, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk factors include a first idiopathic DVT, strongly suggesting the existence of undiagnosed and/or unidentified prothrombotic abnormalities. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of locally increased red blood cell (RBC) aggregation on DVT pathogenesis in a rabbit model. Methods: DVT presence, flow and aggregation were measured in situ with ultrasound. Greatly enhanced aggregation was achieved by covalent linkage of Pluronic F98 to the RBC surface; coating with Pluronic F68, which very mildly enhances aggregation, was used as a coating control. On day 1, endothelial damage and a partial stenosis were surgically created on the left femoral vein whereas the right femoral vein was not manipulated. Results: A thrombus was formed within 30?min in six out of seven left femoral veins of animals receiving a 30% volume blood exchange with F98-coated RBC, whereas a thrombus occurred in only one out of seven veins in F68-transfused controls. In vivo imaging using quantitative ultrasound confirmed increased aggregation in the thrombosed veins of the F98 group compared with the F68 group and the contralateral vessel. For each group, five animals were followed for 2?weeks before being killed. In F98-transfused animals, lysis of clots occurred and the presence of chronic thrombi totally occluding the vein in three out of five animals was confirmed by histology. Conversely, in the F68 group, a single disorganized blood clot was observed in one out of five animals. Conclusions: A marked increase in RBC aggregation promotes thrombosis in rabbit femoral veins, confirming a pathophysiological role of locally altered hemorheology in the onset of DVT.

AB  - Summary Background Previous studies investigating factors associated with survival following endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursa are limited. Objectives To investigate the factors associated with survival in horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated endoscopically and to describe the bacterial isolates involved in the synovial infections. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods Medical records from 128 horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated by endoscopic lavage at seven equine hospitals were reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine survival and return to athletic performance. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards survival models were used to determine factors associated with survival. Results Horses underwent one (n = 107), two (n = 19), or three (n = 2) surgeries. Survival to hospital discharge was 84.4%. Univariable survival analysis revealed that administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.18?0.91, P = 0.03). Increased mortality was associated with bone fracture/osteomyelitis (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12?5.26, P = 0.03), tendon involvement (≥30% cross sectional area) (HR 3.78 95% CI 1.78?8.04, P = 0.001), duration of general anaesthesia (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00?1.02, P = 0.04), post-operative synoviocentesis (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.36?7.43, P = 0.006) and post-operative wound dehiscence (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.08?5.65, P = 0.04). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed reduced mortality after systemic antimicrobial administration prior to referral (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11?0.60, P = 0.002) and increased mortality with tendinous involvement (≥30% cross-sectional area) (HR 7.92, 95% CI 3.31?19.92, P<0.001). At follow-up (median 30 months, range 0.25?13 years, n = 70) 87.1% horses were alive, 7.1% had been euthanised due to the calcaneal injury and 5.7% had been euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses with athletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the same/higher level of exercise, 5.3% to a lower level and 3.5% were retired due to persistent lameness of the affected limb. Main limitations Retrospective study and incomplete follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae has an 84% survival rate to hospital discharge. Tendinous involvement reduced survival whilst systemic antimicrobials administration prior to referral improved survival.

AB  - Abstract Background. The objective of this article was to study the role of high frequency ultrasound and color Doppler imaging in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cervical lymphadenopathy. Methods. The present study was carried out over a period of 18 months and included 64 patients of different age groups presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy. Comprehensive sonographic examination of the neck for cervical lymph nodes was performed using the LOGIQ 500 ultrasound machine (GE Wipro Proseries). The scanning was performed with the patient in the supine position, and with the neck hyperextended using a pad or pillow under the shoulders in order to provide optimum exposure of the neck. The parameters considered in this study included: site, mean long axis (L), mean short axis (S), shape index (S/L), echotexture and homogenicity, margins, ancillary features like calcification, necrosis, posterior enhancement, matting and surrounding tissue changes, vascular pattern, and mean arterial resistive index (RI). These findings were correlated with fine-needle aspiration cytology and excisional biopsy. The nodes were classified as reactive, lymphomatous, and metastatic. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software. A p value of <.05 was considered to be significant. Results. The results showed that malignant lymph nodes, especially metastatic nodes, are mostly accompanied with rounded shape, homogenous echotexture, peripheral vascularity, and significantly high RI. Among these sonographic findings, nodal shape (S/L ratio) and RI were more accurate for differentiating benign from malignant lymph nodes. Most of the malignant nodes had well-defined borders. Calcification, necrosis, posterior enhancement, matting, and hilar flow patterns were characteristically found in tubercular lymphadenitis. A combined ultrasound-guided and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis had a high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (92.3) as compared with situations in which they were used alone. Conclusion. Sonographic findings have a high accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant cervical lymph nodes. An ultrasound scan can be used as the first-line imaging tool in the diagnostic evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy, especially in developing countries like India due to its ease, noninvasiveness, reproducibility, and cost effectiveness. It can also be used as an imaging tool for the guided aspirations. However, because of some overlapping in sonographic appearances of benign and malignant nodes, this modality may not have definite diagnostic values. But when combined with FNA, it has a very high sensitivity and specificity. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2010
