AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Objectives To develop the first high-resolution, multi-scale model of cervical non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) and to predict vagus fiber type activation, given clinically relevant rheobase thresholds. Methods An MRI-derived Finite Element Method (FEM) model was developed to accurately simulate key macroscopic (e.g., skin, soft tissue, muscle) and mesoscopic (cervical enlargement, vertebral arch and foramen, cerebral spinal fluid [CSF], nerve sheath) tissue components to predict extracellular potential, electric field (E-Field), and activating function along the vagus nerve. Microscopic scale biophysical models of axons were developed to compare axons of varying size (Aα-, A?- and Aδ-, B-, and C-fibers). Rheobase threshold estimates were based on a step function waveform. Results Macro-scale accuracy was found to determine E-Field magnitudes around the vagus nerve, while meso-scale precision determined E-field changes (activating function). Mesoscopic anatomical details that capture vagus nerve passage through a changing tissue environment (e.g., bone to soft tissue) profoundly enhanced predicted axon sensitivity while encapsulation in homogenous tissue (e.g., nerve sheath) dulled axon sensitivity to nVNS. Conclusions These findings indicate that realistic and precise modeling at both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales are needed for quantitative predictions of vagus nerve activation. Based on this approach, we predict conventional cervical nVNS protocols can activate A- and B- but not C-fibers. Our state-of-the-art implementation across scales is equally valuable for models of spinal cord stimulation, cortex/deep brain stimulation, and other peripheral/cranial nerve models.

AB  - Summary For many years the search for structural associations of osteoarthritis (OA) pain were based on conventional radiographic imaging that predominantly visualizes bone. As well as being tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the ability to directly visualize all the structures of a joint, including soft tissue and cartilage. Initial MRI studies focused on cartilage assessment, but recently there has been a growing body of work examining the correlation of structural findings with pain in OA and their relation to structural progression. Painful OA knees have more MRI-detected abnormalities and these pathologies are often correlated making individual contributions difficult to assess. However, in large cohort studies, both synovial hypertrophy and large synovial effusions were demonstrated to be more frequent in patients with OA knee pain. Similarly MRI-determined subchondral bone marrow oedema lesions (BME), particularly large ones, are associated with OA knee pain. Meniscal tears in OA knees, although common, have not been linked with pain. Improved, reliable quantification of the structural features and the rapid advances in MRI technology can only improve structure?pain understanding.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To review the literature addressing the assessment and management of pain in patients with polytraumatic injuries including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-related headache, and to identify patient, clinician and systems factors associated with pain-related outcomes. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? We conducted searches in MEDLINE of literature published from 1950 through July 2008. Due to a limited number of studies using controls or comparators, we included observational and rigorous qualitative studies. We systematically rated the quality of systematic reviews, cohort, and case-control design studies. Results.? One systematic review, 93 observational studies, and one qualitative research study met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded no published studies that assessed measures of pain intensity or pain-related functional interference among patients with cognitive deficits due to TBI, that compared patients with blast-related headache with patients with other types of headache, or that assessed treatments for blast-related headache pain. Studies on the association between TBI severity and pain reported mixed findings. There was limited evidence that the following factors are associated with pain among TBI patients: severity, location, and multiplicity of injuries; insomnia; fatigue; depression; and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions.? Very little evidence is currently available to guide pain assessment and treatment approaches in patients with polytrauma. Further research employing systematic observational as well as controlled intervention designs is clearly indicated.

AB  - Abstract Commonly used frameworks for spatial normalization of brain imaging data (e.g., Talairach-space) are based on one or more adult brains. As pediatric brains are different in size and shape from adult brains and continue to develop through childhood, we aimed to assess the influence of age on various spatial normalization parameters. One hundred forty-eight healthy children aged 5?18 years were included in this study. The linear scaling parameters and the deformations from the non-linear spatial normalization to both a standard adult and a custom pediatric template were analyzed within SPM99. The effect of using a brain mask on the linear and of using different levels of constraint on the non-linear spatial normalization was assessed. Of the linear scaling factors, only the X-dimension (left?right) showed a significant age-correlation when based on brain tissue, whereas the overall scaling was not correlated with age. When based on the whole head, a very strong age-effect can be found in all dimensions. Non-linear deformations also show localized correlations with age, most pronounced in parietal and frontal areas. The total amount of volume change is significantly lower when using a pediatric template. It is also substantially influenced by the degree of regularization that is exerted on the spatial normalization parameters. Our results suggest that in the cortical areas showing a strong correlation of deformation with age, caution should be used in assigning imaging results in children to a specific morphological structure. Also, to minimize the amount of deformation during non-linear spatial normalization, a pediatric template should be used. Further implications of our findings on developmental neuroimaging studies are discussed. Hum. Brain Mapping 17:48?60, 2002. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Many would agree that there are two quintessential sexual organs in the female: the clitoris and the brain. Using non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), investigators have gained insight into the mental and physical factors involved in female sexual function. Since only the external clitoral glans is easily accessible for direct measurement, the complete anatomy of the clitoris (including the internal components?paired corpora, crura, and bulbs) has only recently been described, with MRI providing the most sensitive way of distinguishing among the various soft tissue planes. Average sizes of clitoral structures and average distances between the clitoral complex and other pelvic landmarks have been measured. These measurements have been correlated with female sexual function: a longer distance between the clitoral complex and the vaginal lumen correlates with poorer sexual function, consistent with prior imaging studies. However, whether clitoral size influences function is debatable, so further studies are needed. Physiological investigations have demonstrated that female arousal disorder is unlikely to be due to inadequate genital engorgement. Some consider the brain to be the ultimate sexual organ, and several recent studies have used functional MRI (fMRI) to reveal sexual excitability in the brain. The normal sexual response requires deactivation of the frontal lobe and activation of the instinctual limbic system of the midbrain. As MR technology continues to improve, the mysteries of female sexuality will be further unraveled. Clin. Anat. 28:324?330, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was induced by transient (10 min) applications of KCl in agar upon the cortical surface of α-chloralose anaesthetised cats. Its features were compared with CSD resulting from sustained applications of crystalline KCl through a mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DWI) over a poststimulus period of 60?100 min. Individual CSD events were computationally detected with the aid of Savitzky-Golay smoothing applied to critically sampled data derived from regions of interest (ROIs) made up of 2 ? 2 pixel matrices. The latter were consistently placed at three selected sites on the suprasylvian gyrus (SG) and six sites on the marginal gyrus (MG). The CSD events thus detected were then quantitatively characterised for each ROI using the original time series. Both stimuli consistently elicited similar spreading patterns of initial, primary CSD events that propagated over the SG and marginal MG and were restricted to the hemispheres on which the stimuli were applied. There followed secondary events over smaller extents of cortical surface. Sustained stimuli elicited primary and secondary CSD events with similar amplitudes of ADC deflection that were distributed around a single mean. The ADC deflections were also conserved in peak amplitude throughout the course of their propagation. The initial primary event showed a poststimulus latency of 1.1 ± 0.1 min. Successive secondary events followed at longer, but uniform, time intervals of around 10 min. Primary and secondary CSDs showed significantly different velocities of conduction (3.32 ± 0.43 mm min?1vs. 2.11 ± 0.21 mm min?1, respectively; n= 5) across the cerebral hemisphere. In contrast, transient stimuli produced significantly fewer numbers of CSD events (3.8 ± 0.5 events per animal, n= 5) than did sustained stimuli (7.4 ± 0.5 events per animal, mean ±s.e.m., n= 5, P= 0.002). The peak ADC deflection of their primary CSD events declined by ≈30 % as they propagated from their initiation site to the interhemispheric boundary. The primary CSD event following a transient stimulus showed a latency of 1.4 ± 0.1 min. It was followed by successive and smaller secondary ADC deflections that were separated by progressively longer time intervals. Conduction velocities of secondary events were similar to those of primary events. Conduction velocities of both primary and secondary events were slower than their counterparts following a sustained stimulus. ADC changes associated with CSD thus persist at times well after stimulus withdrawal and vary markedly with the nature of the initiating stimulus even in brain regions remote from the stimulus site.

AB  - Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, break down a few days after being assaulted. After a first attempt at denial, the ego is submerged with repressed content. Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to bind the enormous quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge. Repetition, because of its compulsive quality, fails. The victim remains in a state of helplessness against which she resorts to denial, splitting and projection (Freud, 1920, 1926). This strategy is seen, however, as maintaining the victim in a state of helplessness. Thus, I suggest that, overwhelmed, the ego finally resorts to a multi-levelled system of defence. On a first level, fixation to the trauma, like in screen-memories, gives way to a first displacement. On a second level, the adoption of an identity built upon being a victim contributes to the strength of this displacement. On a third level, identification with the aggressor consolidates this defensive strategy by giving meaning to the hostility awakened by the sexual assault.

AB  - Abstract Background The management of hepatic hemangiomas remains ill defined. This study sought to investigate the indications, surgical management and outcomes of patients who underwent a resection for hepatic hemangiomas. Methods A retrospective review from six major liver centres in the United States identifying patients who underwent surgery for hepatic hemangiomas was performed. Clinico-pathological, treatment and peri-operative data were evaluated. Results Of the 241patients who underwent a resection, the median age was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39?53] and 85.5% were female. The median hemangioma size was 8.5?cm (IQR: 6?12.1). Surgery was performed for abdominal symptoms (85%), increasing hemangioma size (11.3%) and patient anxiety (3.7%). Life-threatening complications necessitating a hemangioma resection occurred in three patients (1.2%). Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications occurred in 14 patients (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.8% (n = 2). Of patients with abdominal symptoms, 63.2% reported improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Conclusion A hemangioma resection can be safely performed at high-volume institutions. The primary indication for surgery remains for intractable symptoms. The development of severe complications associated with non-operative management remains a rare event, ultimately challenging the necessity of additional surgical indications for a hemangioma resection.

AB  - (Headache 2011;51:860-868) Migraine is a common, often disabling disorder associated with a significant personal and societal burden. The presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may increase this disability substantially. Migraine and PTSD are both up to 3 times more common in women than in men. The divergence in prevalence rates of migraine and PTSD that occurs between the sexes after puberty suggests that gonadal hormones play an important role. In addition, the preponderance of PTSD in women may be related to their higher rates of interpersonal trauma, the most common cause of PTSD. However, recent data suggest that although the odds of PTSD are increased in both women and men with episodic migraine, this association is stronger in men than women. In this paper, we examine the epidemiology of PTSD and migraine, with an emphasis on the known sex differences. We then discuss the neurobiological changes associated with PTSD, the current hypotheses for the mechanisms relating PTSD and migraine, and the treatment implications of these findings.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Prophylactic mastectomy (PM) is often considered, but variably chosen by women at high inherited risk of breast cancer; few data exist on patient tolerance of intensive breast screening as an alternative to PM. We performed an evaluation of high-risk women's tolerance of a breast screening protocol using clinical breast examination, mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ductal lavage (DL), and of change in attitudes toward PM after screening. Design? A questionnaire assessing tolerance of screening procedures and change in opinion towards PM was designed and administered to 43 study participants, after a median follow-up of 13?months. Responses were evaluated according to patient characteristics, including type of study-prompted interventions, BRCA mutation status, and prior history of cancer, via univariate analysis. Results? Most patients [85.3% (68.9?95.1%)] were more opposed or unchanged in their attitudes towards PM after study participation, with only 14.7% (5.0?31.1%) less opposed (P?=?0.017) despite a short-interval follow-up MRI rate of 71.7% and a biopsy rate of 37%. Lower rates of maximal discomfort were reported with mammogram [2.8% (0?14.5%)] and MRI [5.6% (0?18.7%)] than with DL [28.6% (14.6?46.3%)], with P?=?0.035. Conclusions? Most high-risk women tolerated intensive breast screening well; they were not more inclined towards PM after participating. Future studies should prospectively evaluate larger numbers of high-risk women via multivariate analysis, to determine characteristics associated with preference for breast screening vs. PM.

AB  - ABSTRACT This work evaluates the ability of quantitative MRI to discriminate between normal and pathological human osteochondral plugs characterized by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) histological system. Normal and osteoarthritic human osteochondral plugs were scored using the OARSI histological system and imaged at 3 T using MRI sequences producing T1 and T2 contrast and measuring T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times, magnetization transfer, and diffusion. The classification accuracies of quantitative MRI parameters and corresponding weighted image intensities were evaluated. Classification models based on the Mahalanobis distance metric for each MRI measurement were trained and validated using leave-one-out cross-validation with plugs grouped according to OARSI histological grade and score. MRI measurements used for classification were performed using a region-of-interest analysis which included superficial, deep, and full-thickness cartilage. The best classifiers based on OARSI grade and score were T1- and T2-weighted image intensities, which yielded accuracies of 0.68 and 0.75, respectively. Classification accuracies using OARSI score-based group membership were generally higher when compared with grade-based group membership. MRI-based classification?either using quantitative MRI parameters or weighted image intensities?is able to detect early osteoarthritic tissue changes as classified by the OARSI histological system. These findings suggest the benefit of incorporating quantitative MRI acquisitions in a comprehensive clinical evaluation of OA. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Rapid and accurate recognition of lesions masquerading as acute stroke is important. Any incorrect or delayed diagnosis of stroke mimics will not only increase the risk of being exposed to unnecessary and possibly dangerous interventional therapies, but will also delay proper treatment. In this article, written from a neuroradiologist's perspective, we classified these lesions masquerading as acute stroke into three groups: lesions that may have ?normal imaging,? lesions that are ?symptom mimics? but on imaging clearly not a stroke, and lesions that are ?symptom and imaging mimics? with imaging findings similar to stroke. We focused the review on neuroimaging findings of the latter two groups ending with a suggestion for a diagnostic approach in the form of an algorithm. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of ankle cartilage are observed in degenerative and inflammatory joint disease, but cartilage cannot be directly visualized by radiography. The purpose of this study was therefore to analyze the feasibility and precision of quantitative cartilage imaging in the human hind foot (talocrural, talotarsal, and intertarsal joints), and to report the inter-subject variability for cartilage volume, thickness and surface areas. The feet of 16 healthy volunteers were imaged using a 3D gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence with water-excitation. After interpolation to a resolution of 1 ± 0.125 ± 0.125 mm3 the cartilage plates were segmented, and the cartilage volume, thickness, and surface areas determined. The precision (four repeated measurements) was examined in eight volunteers, the RMS average CV% being 2.1% to 10.9% in single joint surfaces, and ? 3% for the cumulative values of all joints. The mean cartilage thickness ranged from 0.57 ± 0.08 (navicular surface) to 0.89 ± 0.19 mm (trochlear surface for tibia). In conclusion this study shows that it is feasible to quantify thin cartilage layers in the hind foot under in vivo imaging conditions, and that the precision errors are substantially smaller than the inter-subject variability in healthy subjects. ? 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Detecting the presence of injuries to the cervical spine is an important component of the initial assessment of patients sustaining blunt trauma. A small proportion of cervical spine injuries consists of ligamentous disruption. Accurate detection of ligamentous injury is essential as it may result in sequelae including radiculopathy, quadriplegia and death. Flexion?extension (FE) radiography has traditionally been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. There are controversies surrounding the use of FE for alert patients with neck pain. There are studies that call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FE, the high proportion of inadequate FE images due to muscle spasm and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation while awaiting FE. Other literature indicates that FE provides no additional diagnostic information following a multi-detector helical computed tomography. This review evaluates the literature on the utility of FE for the detection of ligamentous injury and explores alternate strategies for clearing the cervical spine of ligamentous injury.
