AB  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a correlate to physical examination in various myelopathies and a predictor of functional outcome. Objectives: To describe associations among MRI features, neurological dysfunction before MRI, and functional outcome in dogs with disk herniation. Animals: One hundred and fifty-nine dogs with acute thoracolumbar disk herniation. Methods: Retrospective case series. Signalment, initial neurological function as assessed by a modified Frankel score (MFS), and ambulatory outcome at hospital discharge and >3 months (long-term) follow-up were recorded from medical records and telephone interview of owners. Associations were estimated between these parameters and MRI signal and morphometric data. Results: Dogs with intramedullary T2W hyperintensity had more severe pre-MRI MFS (median 2, range 0?4) and lower ambulatory proportion at long-term follow-up (0.76) than those dogs lacking hyperintensity (median MFS 3, range 0?5; ambulatory proportion, 0.93) (P=.001 and .013, respectively). Each unit of T2W length ratio was associated with a 1.9 times lower odds of long-term ambulation when adjusted for pre-MRI MFS (95% confidence interval 1.0?3.52, P=.05). Dogs with a compressive length ratio >1.31 (which was the median ratio within this population) had more severe pre-MRI MFS (median 3, range 0?5) compared with those with ratios ≤1.31 (median MFS 3, range 0?4; P=.006). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: MRI features were associated with initial injury severity in dogs with thoracolumbar disk herniation. Based on results of this study, the T2W length ratio and presence of T2W intramedullary hyperintensity appear to be predictive of long-term ambulatory status.

AB  - Entheses are regions where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, and are the primary target in seronegative and other diseases of the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. MRI has been widely used for visualizing features of inflammatory and degenerative MSK disease; however, normal tendons and entheses have short transverse relaxation times (T2), and show little or no signal with conventional clinical MRI pulse sequences, making it difficult to investigate their MR properties. In this study we examined the normal MR morphology of the cadaveric Achilles tendon and enthesis at 3 T using novel three-dimensional ultrashort echo time (3D UTE) Cones sequences, and at 11.7 T using conventional MRI sequences. We also studied the MR properties of the Achilles tendon and enthesis including T2*, T1, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). In addition, MT modeling of macromolecular proton fractions was investigated using 3D UTE Cones sequences at 3 T. Indentation testing was performed to investigate the mechanical properties of the tendons and entheses, and this was followed by histological examination. In total five specimens (<50 years) were investigated. On average, tendons and entheses respectively had T2* values of 0.93 ± 0.48 ms and 2.77 ± 0.79 ms, T1 values of 644 ± 22 ms and 780 ± 55 ms, MTRs of 0.373 ± 0.03 and 0.244 ± 0.009 with an MT power of 1000° and frequency offset of 2 kHz, and macromolecular proton fractions of 18.0 ± 2.2% and 13.9 ± 1.9%. Compared with the tendon, the enthesis generally had a longer T2*, a longer T1, a lower MTR, and a lower macromolecular proton fraction as well as both a higher Young's modulus and stiffness. Results from this study are likely to provide a useful baseline for identifying deviations from the normal in seronegative arthritis and other disease of the entheses.

AB  - Background? Abdominal donor site flaps, including the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (TRAM) and Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery (DIEA) perforator flaps, are the standard in autologous breast reconstruction. With variation in the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall, preoperative imaging is essential for preoperative planning and reducing intraoperative error. Ultrasound has been used previously with varying results, and the quest continues for optimal preoperative assessment. Computerised Tomography Angiography (CTA) has been recently proposed as a non-invasive modality for this purpose. This is the first study to formally compare preoperative Doppler ultrasound with CTA for imaging the DIEA. Methodology? Eight consecutive patients undergoing DIEA perforator flaps for breast reconstruction undertook both CTA and Doppler ultrasound preoperatively. All investigations and procedures were undertaken at the same institution with the same surgeon and radiology team. Results? CTA was superior at identifying the course of the DIEA, its branching pattern and in visualizing its perforators than Doppler ultrasound. Preoperative CTA was highly specific (100%) and more sensitive in mapping and visualising perforators (p?<?0.001). CTA was also proficient at identifying the superficial epigastric arterial system and for effectively displaying the results intraoperatively. CTA was substantially quicker and removed the inter-observer error associated with Doppler ultrasonography. The study was ceased after eight patients due to the overwhelming benefit of CTA over Doppler. Conclusions? CTA is a valuable imaging modality for the preoperative assessment of the donor site vascular supply for TRAM and DIEA perforator flaps.

It is rare to find a Duret haemorrhage on imaging. This case has been presented to highlight the rarity of the condition and the unusual posterior location of the bleed and also the universally fatal nature of these haemorrhages.

AB  - Abstract This article explores the issue of how the potent, alluring image of John Kennedy was constructed. The essay begins with an examination of how, even before reaching the White House, Kennedy was able to develop a multi-faceted image as a man of letters (with the publication of Why England Slept and Profiles in Courage), military hero (through his service in the Navy during the Second World War), precocious politician, erotic symbol and symbol of the family. The importance of image to the outcome of the 1960 presidential campaign, particularly in terms of the television debates with Richard Nixon, is assessed. Kennedy's presidency is examined for the way it reinforced ideas about him that had come to the fore before he became chief executive: his use of the White House to showcase the arts, thereby strengthening his image as a man of letters and cultural refinement; the enhancing of his war-hero status with the release of the Hollywood film PT-109; the continued eroticization of his image through his public links with Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Anita Ekberg; and the prominence of his wife, siblings, children and parents in reinforcing the image of JFK as a symbol of the family. The impact of the assassination is considered for the way it created the Camelot mythology that came to adorn Kennedy's posthumous reputation. How Kennedy's image was sustained from the time of the assassination to recent years ? through film, music, architecture and the visual image ? will also be examined.

AB  - Abstract Aims: This parallel-group, multi-centre, double-blind, randomized-controlled clinical trial was undertaken to compare the clinical outcomes and patient morbidity of coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone or in combination with a connective tissue graft (CAF+CTG) in single Miller Class I and II gingival recessions. Material and Methods: Three centres enrolled 85 patients with one recession each. Surgery was performed elevating a pedicle flap; 42 sites randomly received a graft under the flap. Measurements were taken by blind and calibrated examiners. Outcome measures included recession reduction, complete root coverage (CRC), intra-operative and post-operative morbidity, dentine sensitivity, and side effects. Results: No differences were noted in the intra-operative and post-operative patient-related variables between the two groups. Surgical time was significantly shorter in the CAF group. Recession reduction was not statistically different between the two groups, even though a model showed a tendency towards improved outcomes in sites treated with CAF+CTG (adjusted difference 0.33?mm, 95% CI=?0.06 to 0.72, p=0.1002). Significantly greater probability of CRC was observed after CAF+CTG (adjusted OR=5.09, 95% CI=1.69?17.57, p=0.0033). Dentine hypersensitivity improved in both the groups. Conclusions: Both treatments were effective in providing a significant reduction of the baseline recession and dentine hypersensitivity, with only limited intra-operative and post-operative morbidity and side effects. Adjunctive application of a CTG under a CAF increased the probability of achieving CRC in maxillary Miller Class I and II defects.

AB  - This paper considers the debate over how we attribute beliefs, desires, and other mental states to our fellows. Do we employ a theory of mind? Or do we use simulational brain mechanisms, but employ no theory? One point of dispute between these theories focuses upon our ability to have empathic knowledge of the mind of another. I consider whether an argument posed by Ravenscroft settles the debate in favor of Simulation Theory. I suggest that the consideration of empathy does not settle the dispute. Then I look at recent results from false memory research and other research employing neural imaging. I suggest that new discoveries there may help shape the future of the empirical dimension of the debate.

AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of brachial plexus anatomy bilaterally, not possible by plain radiographs or CT, were presented to the Vascular Surgery, Neurology, and the Neurosurgery departments. Patients were requested for MRI of their brachial plexus. They were referred for imaging and the imaging results were presented to the faculty and housestaff. Our technique was accepted and adopted to begin referrals for MRI evaluation of brachial plexopathy. Over 175 patients have been studied. Eighty-five patients were imaged with the 1.5 Tesla magnet (Signa; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) 3-D reconstruction MRI. Coronal, transverse (axial), oblique transverse, and sagittal plane T1-weighted and selected T2-weighted pulse sequences were obtained at 4?5 mm slice thickness, 40?45 full field of view, and a 512 ? 256 size matrix. Saline water bags were used to enhance the signal between the neck and the thorax. Sites of brachial plexus compromise were demonstrated. Our technique with 3-D reconstruction increased the definition of brachial plexus pathology. The increased anatomical definition enabled the vascular surgeons and neurosurgeons to improve patient care. Brachial plexus in vivo anatomy as displayed by MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and 3-D reconstruction offered an opportunity to augment the teaching of clinical anatomy to medical students and health professionals. Selected case presentations (body builder, anomalous muscle, fractured clavicle, thyroid goiter, silicone breast implant rupture, and cervical rib) demonstrated compromise of the brachial plexus displayed by MRI. The MRI and 3-D reconstruction techniques, demonstrating the bilateral landmark anatomy, increased the definition of the clinical anatomy and resulted in greater knowledge of patient care management. ? 1995 WiIey-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Interforaminal implant surgery requires anatomical knowledge of the area and adequate information on the location of the various landmarks of significance such as the mental foramen, the anterior loop of the inferior alveolar nerve and the mandibular incisive canal. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a relatively new imaging modality that provides a multi-dimensional view of the facial skeleton with, in most instances, lower radiation dose to the patient compared to medical CT. The present study aims to use CBCT to identify and measure variation in the presence and extent of the anterior loop of the inferior alveolar nerve. This information may be used to provide recommendations to the surgeon without access to a 3D scan of the dento-alveolar region. Material and methods Ninety-three patients scanned with a Newtom VG device for a variety of clinical indications were included in this retrospective study. Using the multiplanar capabilities of the device's software the prevalence and length of the anterior loop was assessed. Results The results show that an anterior loop could be identified in 48% of the cases with a mean length (range) of 0.89 mm (0?5.7). Conclusions In almost half of the surveyed cases an anterior loop was present. Even though in 95% of the study cases the loop was <3 mm, a 100% safety margin in the placement of anterior mandibular implants, in the absence of a CBCT scan, would only be achieved with a distance of 6 mm between the anterior border of the mental foramen and the most distal interforaminal implant fixture.

AB  - How can we study the ?quality of psychoanalytic treatments?? The authors attempt to answer this question by discussing a naturalistic, multi-perspective and representative follow-up study of psychoanalyses and long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapies. We studied a representative sample (n = 401) of all the patients who had terminated their psychoanalytic treatments with members of the German Psychoanalytical Association (DPV) between 1990 and 1993. Between 70 and 80 per cent of the patients achieved (average 6.5 years after the end of treatment) good and stable psychic changes according to the evaluations of the patients themselves, their analysts, independent psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic experts, and questionnaires commonly applied in psychotherapy research. The evaluation of mental health costs showed a cost reduction through fewer days of sick leave during the seven years following the end of long-term psychoanalytic treatments. The results achieved using non-psychoanalytical instruments are complemented by the richness of the idiosyncratic findings, gained by the psychoanalytic research instruments.

AB  - A Laser Speckle Perfusion Imaging (LSPI) system has been developed to achieve rapid, high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of tissue blood flow. This study was designed to evaluate LSPI for monitoring dermal blood flow during the wound healing process in a well-established porcine model. Full-thickness excisional wounds (2???2?cm) were created on the dorsal skin of 11 juvenile female red Duroc pigs. The skin wounds were imaged weekly with the LSPI system until day 49 postwounding. Blood flow values for the wounds were normalized using the values from the surrounding healthy skin to account for variations in systemic perfusion from one scan date to the next. An average normalized perfusion value was obtained from the scans of all animals for each time point. Wound perfusion at the time of reepithelialization reached ?165% of the surrounding skin (p?<?0.001). This elevation in wound perfusion slowly and steadily decreased over time, until day 49 postwounding, at which time the values returned to normal. This trend toward decreased wound perfusion over time has previously been reported in human burn wounds using the LSPI instrument. Further, the LSPI data from this study and from other human studies correlates well with data generated using the more widely established Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) technique. The faster scan time and higher resolution of the LSPI method provides a distinct clinical advantage, both in terms of patient comfort and for reliably matching perfusion characteristics to their associated anatomical features. The fast temporal response of the LSPI instrument could be used to monitor vascular responses to mechanical or pharmacological interventions to study dynamic vascular changes to damaged tissues. This study validates LSPI as a tool to measure blood flow in skin wounds and further supports the use of the juvenile female pig as a model of excisional wound healing, yielding results comparable to healing in humans.

AB  - Abstract Detection and accurate classification of traumatic tarsal fractures are important for identifying cases requiring surgical intervention. The aim of this prospective, experimental, methods comparison study was to directly compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tarsal computed tomography (CT), ten-view and two-view digital radiographs for detecting traumatic fractures of the canine tarsus. The working hypothesis was that tarsal fractures would be detected with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using CT imaging compared to radiography, and a ten-view would be superior to a two-view radiographic study. Ten cadaver hind limbs of medium to large dogs received a CT scan and ten-view radiographic study before and after induction of fractures with a hydraulic press. All bones included in the radiographic images were assessed for fractures by two observers and gross dissection was used as the gold standard. The two-view radiographic study (dorsoplantar, lateromedial) was created from the ten-view study and reviewed 2 years later. All limbs sustained fractures, the most common locations were the talus and calcaneus (n = 7). The sensitivity of CT was greater than ten-view radiographic study (77% vs. 57%), while the specificity was similar (97% vs. 98%). The sensitivity and specificity of the ten-view and two-view radiograph studies were similar (57% vs. 55%; both 98%). Computed tomography images were reassessed postdissection to determine if failure to identify fractures resulted from observer error. Overall, CT was better than radiography for detecting fractures of the canine tarsus, however there was little improvement with ten-view compared to two-view radiographic studies.

AB  - Abstract In the past decade, the utility of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images in oral and maxillofacial surgery has seen continuous increase. However, CBCT images are not always able to replace other imaging modalities. Based on the current published knowledge, this paper discusses advantages and limitations of CBCT images in the diagnosis and surgical planning of dentoalveolar procedures, odontogenic cysts, benign and malignant tumours, inflammatory changes, orthognathic surgery, maxillofacial trauma, sinus disorders, and systemic and osseous conditions that manifest in the maxillofacial area. This paper also suggests alternative imaging modalities when CBCT images are not adequate for surgical planning.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess emergency department (ED) doctors? knowledge of radiation doses associated with diagnostic imaging and to describe their practice with regard to informing patients of risk. Design, participants and setting: Prospective, questionnaire-based observational study in May 2009 among all 110 doctors in the EDs of a 570-bed teaching hospital and a 200-bed district hospital. Main outcome measures: Percentage knowledge score; and frequency of discussing radiation risk with patients, based on responses to three scenarios rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where a score of 100 indicates doctors would always discuss it. Results: 96 doctors (87%) completed the questionnaire. The overall mean knowledge score was 40% (95% CI, 38%?43%). Senior doctors scored somewhat higher than junior doctors, but not significantly (42% v 39%; P = 0.75). Over three-quarters of doctors (78%) underestimated the lifetime risk of fatal cancer attributable to a single computed tomography scan of the abdomen. Most doctors (76%) reported never having had any formal training on risks to patients from radiation exposure. The frequency at which doctors would inform patients of the risk of radiation varied greatly depending on the clinical scenario (mean VAS scores, between 38 and 90). Conclusion: Emergency doctors in our sample had a varied knowledge of the risks from radiation exposure, but overall knowledge was poor. Staff should receive education, and the diagnostic imaging request process may need to include information on radiation doses and risks.

AB  - Neuropsychological evaluation of persons with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) symptoms is complicated by multiple factors. The authors explored the impact of mechanism of injury, effort testing performance, and neuropsychiatric status in a sample of military veterans (V-TBI) and civilians (C-TBI) with chronic TBI. V-TBI (n?=?74), C-TBI (n?=?67), and healthy civilian control (C-HC) participants (n?=?66), completed a battery of neuropsychological, effort, and self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Results indicated that C-HC and C-TBI participants exhibited comparably low failure rates on effort tests (6% and 3%, respectively). V-TBI participants exhibited significantly higher rates of failure (18%). Subgroups (n?=?20) of effort-screened participants matched for demographics and disability level were compared regarding neuropsychological performance and neuropsychiatric self-report. Both TBI groups exhibited limited neuropsychological impairment, relative to the C-HC participants. The V-TBI group exhibited pronounced neuropsychiatric symptomology compared with the other participant groups. The implications of these findings are discussed for evaluation in the context of disability and litigation. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the immature brain are more severe and persistent than injuries to the adult brain. Understanding this developmental sensitivity is critical because children under 4 years of age of sustain TBI more frequently than any other age group. One of the first events after TBI is the infiltration and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in the brain, releasing a range of immunomodulatory substances; inhibition of these cells is neuroprotective in other types of neonatal brain injury. This study investigates for the first time the role of MCs in mediating injury in a P7 mouse model of pediatric contusion-induced TBI. We show that various neural cell types express histamine receptors and that histamine exacerbates excitotoxic cell death in primary cultured neurons. Cromoglycate, an inhibitor of MC degranulation, altered the inflammatory phenotype of microglia activated by TBI, reversing several changes but accentuating others, when administered before TBI. However, without regard to the time of cromoglycate administration, inhibiting MC degranulation did not affect cell loss, as evaluated by ventricular dilatation or cleaved caspase-3 labeling, or the density of activated microglia, neurons, or myelin. In double-heterozygous cKit mutant mice lacking MCs, this overall lack of effect was confirmed. These results suggest that the role of MCs in this model of pediatric TBI is restricted to subtle effects and that they are unlikely to be viable neurotherapeutic targets. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary condition characterized by dense hyperostotic lesions with radiographic ?dripping candle wax? appearance. Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 have recently been identified as a cause of melorheostosis. However, little is known about the development, composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the bone lesions. We performed a multi-method phenotype characterization of material properties in affected and unaffected bone biopsy samples from six melorheostosis patients with MAP2K1 mutations. On standard histology, lesions show a zone with intensively remodeled osteonal-like structure and prominent osteoid accumulation, covered by a shell formed through bone apposition, consisting of compact multi-layered lamellae oriented parallel to the periosteal surface and devoid of osteoid. Compared with unaffected bone, melorheostotic bone has lower average mineralization density measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (CaMean: ?4.5%, p?=?0.04). The lamellar portion of the lesion is even less mineralized, possibly because the newly deposited material has younger tissue age. Affected bone has higher porosity by micro-CT, due to increased tissue vascularity and elevated 2D-microporosity (osteocyte lacunar porosity: +39%, p?=?0.01) determined on quantitative backscattered electron images. Furthermore, nano-indentation modulus characterizing material hardness and stiffness was strictly dependent on tissue mineralization (correlation with typical calcium concentration, CaPeak: r?=?0.8984, p?=?0.0150, and r?=?0.9788, p?=?0.0007, respectively) in both affected and unaffected bone, indicating that the surgical hardness of melorheostotic lesions results from their lamellar structure. The results suggest a model for pathophysiology of melorheostosis caused by somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1, in which the genetically induced gradual deterioration of bone microarchitecture triggers a periosteal reaction, similar to the process found to occur after bone infection or local trauma, and leads to an overall cortical outgrowth. The micromechanical properties of the lesions reflect their structural heterogeneity and correlate with local variations in mineral content, tissue age, and remodeling rates, in the same way as normal bone. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of traumatic spino-pelvic dissociation (TSD) treated with modified bilateral triangular fixation. Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.
