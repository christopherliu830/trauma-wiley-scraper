AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) changed radically with the advent of Multi Slice CT (MSCT) which enabled necessary technical improvements for the study of blood vessels, particularly arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has some advantages when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MSCT scanners are widely available in places such as emergency rooms and research centers for the diagnosis and research of stroke. Arterial venous malformations, blunt vascular trauma, aneurysms and several other diseases can also be studied with CTA. Since the early 1990's there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications regarding CTA and its widespread use makes it an essential tool in the radiologist's armamentarium.

AB  - This case study was the first of its kind, where neutron computed tomography (CT) was applied to a wrapped mummified animal. Conventional X-ray CT was also used to allow for meaningful comparison, and complementary data for a comprehensive investigation. Previous applications of both techniques are limited to metallic objects, such as bronze Buddhas. The mummy used in this study (IA.2402) is dated between the Third Intermediate Period (1069?664 bce) to Late Period (664?332 bce) according to the wrapping style, and was originally believed to contain a complete skeleton of a feline. However, precise date and provenance were unknown. Our results prove the presence of only partial juvenile feline remains, and provide a date range for artefact creation (900?804 bce ± 30) and alteration (367?204 bce ± 30). Therefore, this study implements an established imaging technique (neutron CT) in a novel way, while preserving and conserving the intrinsic value of the artefact through non-destructive investigation.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the incidence of spinal fractures and their outcomes in the elderly who fall from low-levels in a suburban county. Design Retrospective county-wide trauma registry review from 2004 to 2013. Setting Suburban county with regionalized trauma care consisting of 11 hospitals. Participants Adult trauma patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted after falling from <3 feet. Measurements Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Results Spinal fractures occurred in 18% of 4,202 older adult patients admitted following trauma over this 10-year time period, in the following distribution: 43% cervical spine, 5.7% thoracic, 4.9% lumbar spine, 36% sacrococcygeal, and 9.6% multiple spinal regions. As compared to non-spinal fracture patients, more spinal fracture patients went to acute/subacute rehabilitation (47% vs 34%, P < .001) and fewer were discharged home (21% vs 35%, P < .001). In-hospital mortality rate in spinal and non-spinal fracture patients was similar (8.5% vs 9.3%, P = .5). Conclusion Low-level falls often resulted in a spinal fracture at a variety of levels. Vigilance in evaluation of the entire spine in this population is suggested.

Ultrasound examination showed hypomotile, fluid-distended small intestines, and thrombosed jejunal veins. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed and showed a CT ?whirl sign,? an important but nonspecific sign of intestinal volvulus in human patients. At surgery, the majority of the small intestine was entangled in the volvulus and showed black discoloration. The patient was euthanized. Postmortem evaluation yielded a diagnosis of jejunoileal mesenteric volvulus secondary to a congenital omphalomesenteric duct remnant.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the suitability of functional and morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model and further to validate that the ischemic injury was successfully induced. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T (Siemens Vision, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) in piglets (n?=?10; age 12?36?h) under general anaesthesia. Hypoxia was induced by ventilation of a gas mixture containing 8% O2 in N2 (AGA, Oslo, Norway). Ischemia was induced by bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (CCA). HI was maintained for 30?min, followed by re-oxygenation with ambient air (21% O2) for 2.5?h. Relative cerebral flow (rCF) was estimated using a single shot SE-EPI sequence (TE?=?85?ms, voxel size 1???1???5?mm3), measuring the first-pass response following bolus injection of an intravascular iron oxide nanoparticulate contrast agent (NC100150 Injection; Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway) at a dose of 4.5?mg Fe/kg. rBF maps were generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from the peak height of a gamma-variate function fitted to the first-pass contrast agent response. The presence of total carotid occlusion was assessed by MR angiography (MRA). MRA images (3D-GRE, TR/TE 4.4?ms/1.8?ms, voxel size 0.9???0.9???1.5?mm3) were acquired after contrast administration; utilizing the T1-effect of NC100150 injection. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously during the experiment via a catheter placed in the femoral artery. Blood gasses and rectal temperature were measured at regular intervals. At the end of the experiment, the piglets were given an overdose of 150?mg/kg Pentobarbital i.v., and a dissection was performed in order to identify structures identified on the MRI. MR angio (MRA) and volume rendering identified a prominent, highly vascularized, defined structure close to the eyeball, medioventrally. At dissection, when comparing with the MR images, the deep gland of the third eyelid, the Harderian gland, corresponded to this structure both by topography and size. It was thick, brownish and finely lobulated, and extended from the cartilage of the third eyelid towards the origin of the extrinsic eye muscles at the apex of the orbit. In contrast, the lacrimal gland presented as a small, soft and pale structure that was difficult to distinguish from the surrounding connective tissue. At histological examination, the Harderian gland consisted mostly of compact areas of alveolar glands with abundant eosinophilic granules. Wide thin-walled vessels were conspicuous in the interlobular connective tissue and the capsule. The present MRI demonstration of the Harderian gland was an accidental finding during an investigation to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model. In pig, this gland has received little attention in the literature. However, taking its size and blood supply into consideration, it must be of significant importance also in the pig. It is mostly studied in rodents and lower vertebrates and is found to possess various endocrine functions as well as exocrine.

AB  - Eccentric exercise affects muscles differentially according to intensity, duration, and previous exposure to the specific exercise activity. We used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences to localize and quantify muscle damage following step exercise and to determine correlations between transverse relaxation time (T2) and other markers of muscle damage. Eight women performed two-step exercise bouts (30?min) separated by 8 weeks. Blood samples, MR scans, measurements of muscle strength, and muscle soreness were obtained immediately before, after, and up to 9 days after each bout. Resting muscle T2 (40.3±0.6?ms) increased exclusively in m. Adductor magnus (AM) in the thigh performing eccentric contractions and peaked 3 days after bout 1 (73.5±9.7?ms, P<0.05). Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity peaked on day 3 after bout 1 and correlated with T2 in AM (r=0.96, P<0.001). After bout 2 CK and T2 were almost unaffected. This indicates that T2-weighted MRI can be applied to identify muscles from which enzymes are being released into the circulation.

AB  - Aims and objectives To explore body image matters amongst patients following massive weight loss. Background In contemporary health care, a growing number of morbidly obese patients are seeking surgical solutions such as bariatric surgery or in other cases engaging with radical lifestyle changes. Massive weight loss can leave patients with a huge excess of lax overstretched skin that in some cases can trigger major body image dissatisfaction or depression. There is a scarcity of research about the needs of this group of patients and this is important for nursing practice. Design A qualitative design using in-depth interviews was employed. Methods Twenty white adults (18 women and two men) were recruited retrospectively amongst patients who had massive weight loss by undergoing bariatric surgery or radical lifestyle changes, aged 29?63 years. All of the participants gave signed informed consent. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results One core theme focusing on body image ugliness and three associated subthemes were identified: the subthemes included feeling socially marginalised, feeling depressed and sexual and intimacy difficulties. Conclusion Body image matters are hugely significant and appear to have a lasting effect on emotional well-being and function, contributing to psychological distress and social isolation. Greater sensitivity is required in enabling patients to work through emotional isolation and shame that has been a part of their childhood. Furthermore more, treatments need to be accessible to this growing patient population such as reconstructive surgery. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses who care for massive weight loss patients need to be mindful of their psychodynamic needs and be non-judgemental and accepting. Moreover, nurses need to be aware of treatment options and be able to assess body image matters and implement quality care for this particular patient group including body image acceptance programmes and support groups.

AB  - Abstract Purpose. To evaluate the sonographic features of traumatic neuromas after neck dissection. Methods. This study included 8 patients whose ages ranged from 36?69 years (mean, 49 years). In all cases, traumatic neuromas were incidentally detected at neck sonography for evaluation of suspected recurrence of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. All sonograms and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results. This study covered 8 cases in which traumatic neuromas were diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and other imaging modalities. None of the patients had clinical signs of neuromas, which were, incidentally, discovered by neck sonography. A noticeable sonographic feature in all cases was an isoechoic mass with internal parallel heterogeneous hyperechogenicity. All patients complained of severe pain during FNAB. The cytological results of 2 patients showed fragments of nerve tissue. The remaining 6 FNABs were nondiagnostic. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in washout fluids from FNAB of all patients were <0.2 ng/mL, indicating nonthyroidal origin. Conclusion. Distinctive sonographic features, sharp pain during FNAB, and low Tg levels in FNAB washout fluid can help to diagnose traumatic neuromas without surgery. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The integration of visual features is important for recognizing objects as a coherent whole, a key domain of difficulty in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We tested the hypothesis that ASD patients exhibit difficulties in facial emotional recognition via perceptual binding difficulties due to weak coherence. We assessed 18 ASD and 27 typically developing individuals for their ability to identify emotional expressions from faces in pictures moving behind a narrow vertical and horizontal slit. In this task, only a single local piece of facial information was provided at any one time through the slit. Using a voxel-based analysis of neurite-orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), we examined the relationship between NODDI index values at each voxel and the behavioral performance of ASD patients in the slit-viewing paradigm. ASD patients demonstrated impaired recognition of facial emotional expression only in horizontal slit-viewing. This deficit was associated with deficits in communication ability. Voxel-based analysis revealed significant negative correlations between behavioral deficits in horizontal slit-viewing and NODDI index values in clusters including the ventral occipital complex region, superior temporal/parietal association areas, and forceps major of the corpus callosum. Our results indicated deficits for the first time in perceptual integration of facial expression across hemispheres in ASD patients due to microstructural disturbances in the corpus callosum and areas related to viewing of the human face. This may underscore the difficulties faced by ASD patients in understanding the emotions of other people, contributing to impairments in communication ability in ASD patients. Autism Res 2019, 00: 1?10. ? 2019 International Society for Autism Research,Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary We assessed ASD and typically developing individuals for their ability to identify emotional expressions from faces in pictures moving behind a narrow vertical and horizontal slit. ASD patients demonstrated impaired recognition of facial emotional expression only in horizontal slit-viewing. Voxel-based analysis revealed significant negative correlations between behavioral deficits and NODDI index values in clusters including the corpus callosum. Our results indicated deficits in perceptual integration of facial expression across hemispheres in ASD patients potentially resulting from microstructural disturbances.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and importance of superficial echogenic lesions around cranial sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and neuroimaging studies of 40 neonates who had superficial echogenic lesions around sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Magnetic resonance imaging (n = 18) and computed tomography (n = 2) were performed within 2 weeks after sonography. We correlated sonographic findings with computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings and analyzed them. We also evaluated the associated lesions, neurologic signs, and follow-up changes. Results Sonographically, the superficial echogenic lesions involved both sulci and perisulcal parenchyma in 39 neonates and were located in the frontal and parietal areas around the sagittal suture in 38 neonates. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in 9 neonates, birth trauma in 3 neonates, a mixed pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and trauma in 3 neonates, nonspecific single infarctions in 2 neonates, and lack of a defined lesion in 1 neonate. The associated lesions were subdural hemorrhage (n = 12), epidural hematoma (n = 4), germinal matrix hemorrhage (n = 3), intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 2), and periventricular leukomalacia (n = 1). All epidural hematomas were associated with scalp hematoma, and 2 patients had skull fractures. One neonate with epidural hematoma associated with a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy pattern showed mild spasticity in both ankles until 16 months. Conclusions Superficial echogenic lesions detected around cranial sutures on neonatal sonography may be an indicator of more serious intracranial lesions such as more extensive hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and intracranial hematomas, including epidural hematoma.

AB  - Abstract The ability to mentally design and evaluate series of future actions has often been studied in terms of planning abilities, commonly using well-structured laboratory tasks like the Tower of London (ToL). Despite a wealth of studies, findings on the specific localization of planning processes within prefrontal cortex (PFC) and on the hemispheric lateralization are equivocal. Here, we address this issue by integrating evidence from two different sources of data: First, we provide a systematic overview of the existing lesion data on planning in the ToL (10 studies, 211 patients) which does not indicate any evidence for a general lateralization of planning processes in (pre)frontal cortex. Second, we report a quantitative meta-analysis with activation likelihood estimation based on 31 functional neuroimaging datasets on the ToL. Separate meta-analyses of the activation patterns reported for Overall Planning (537 participants) and for Planning Complexity (182 participants) congruently show bilateral contributions of mid-dorsolateral PFC, frontal eye fields, supplementary motor area, precuneus, caudate, anterior insula, and inferior parietal cortex in addition to a left-lateralized involvement of rostrolateral PFC. In contrast to previous attributions of planning-related brain activity to the entire dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and either its left or right homolog derived from single studies on the ToL, the present meta-analyses stress the pivotal role specifically of the mid-dorsolateral part of PFC (mid-dlPFC), presumably corresponding to Brodmann Areas 46 and 9/46, and strongly argue for a bilateral rather than lateralized involvement of the dlPFC in planning in the ToL.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ovaries consist of numerous follicles, oocytes, and granulosa cells in different stages of development. Many of these follicles will undergo an apoptotic process during the lifetime of the animal. By using proper tissue preparation methods, the events within the whole ovary can be observed by using 3D confocal microscopy. Methods: Whole ovaries were stained with LysoTracker Red (LT), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) and 1% glutaraldehyde (Glut), dehydrated with methanol (MEOH), and cleared with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate (BABB). Using this tissue preparation technique, the ovary becomes relatively transparent, allowing its morphology to be observed with confocal microscopes. A spectral imaging system (PARISS) located on a conventional microscope was used to interpret the LT dye spectra and fixation products in the tissues with different excitation wavelengths. Results: Apoptosis in the follicle was detected as clusters of intensely stained granulosa cells located in close proximity to the oocytes. The fixation with Glut and PF preserved morphological details, increased tissue fluorescence, thus increased the signal to noise of the background image. Conclusions: Thick tissues can be imaged after they are properly stained, aldehyde fixed, and BABB cleared. LT intensely stained single cells or clusters of apoptotic cells in the follicles and the nucleolus. Spectral differences between LT as an indicator of apoptosis and Glut-PF fixation was used to visualize ovarian morphology and apoptosis. The PARISS spectrophotometer revealed spectral peaks for LT at 609.6 nm and for Glut-PF at 471.3 nm. The proper use of the spectra from these fluorescence molecules is the foundation for high quality morphological images of apoptosis. By sequentially imaging the two probes with a 488 nm laser and a 543/568 nm laser, there was a reduction in fluorescent cross talk and an increase in image quality. ? 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the aetiological associations, neurological sequelae and role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in term newborn infants with seizures. Methods Cohort study of infants ≥37 weeks' gestation delivered in a tertiary level centre, prospectively identified and followed longitudinally for 18?24 months. Results An underlying aetiology was found in 95% of the 77 infants identified with seizures (3.0/1000 live births). The most common diagnosis was hypoxic?ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (65%), followed by neonatal stroke (12%). Nine infants died, 28 of the 68 survivors developed neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), and 15 had recurrent seizures in the first 2 years, with both outcomes more likely in those with a diagnosis other than HIE. Abnormal MRI findings were found in 45 of the 70 infants imaged. The absence of major cerebral lesions was highly predictive of a normal neurological outcome. Conclusion We report the first cohort of term infants with seizures fully investigated by MRI. The universal use of MRI enabled a cause to be identified in 95% of cases. The probability of having NDI or recurrence of seizures was extremely low with absence of major cerebral lesions on MRI. This study demonstrates the added value of MRI for diagnosis of aetiology and the prediction of neurological outcome.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of the present study was to report the clinicopathologic, radiographic and immunohistochemical features of five South American cases of intraosseous xanthomas of the mandible and to compare them to those detected in a literature review. Methods Clinical data were collected from the records of three Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology services in South America and compared with those compiled from a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus). All cases were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD68 and S-100. Results The series comprised four females (80%) and one male (20%) with a mean age of 23.3 ± 10.9 years (range: 13-45 years). In four cases, there was involvement of the posterior region of the mandible (80%). The lesions presented radiographically as unilocular (60%) radiolucencies with punched-out margin (80%). All cases predominantly consisted of CD68-positive and S-100-negative xanthomatous cells. No recurrences were observed after curettage, with a median follow-up of 27 months. Conclusion Intraosseous xanthoma of the jaws is a rare benign disorder. We report here five additional cases affecting the mandible, for a total of 36 cases of the jaws reported in the literature. Overall, this lesion has predilection for posterior sites of the mandible of asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - Abstract Adaptive behavior impairments have been reported in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) but are not typically found following mild TBI. It is possible that mild TBI induces subtle changes in adaptive functioning that are not captured in conventional group comparisons. This study aimed to explore time course changes in adaptive functioning following early mild TBI. Parents of 63 children with mild TBI and 53 children with orthopedic injuries aged between 1.5 and 5 years at the time of injury completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II at three time points: retrospectively to assess pre-injury functioning, then at 6 and 18 months post-injury. Developmental trajectories of adaptive functioning domains (practical, conceptual, and social) reported by parents were modeled using linear mixed-model analyses. Findings suggest that mild TBI may disrupt the expected developmental progression of children's social adaptive behavior, but does not appear to alter practical and conceptual domains.
