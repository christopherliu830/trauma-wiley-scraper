AB  - Abstract When spherical aberration was found to be degrading the performance of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), great interest in image restoration methods arose in the astronomical community. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) method became the preferred tool for restoring such data which typically has Poisson noise characteristics and a low signal-to-noise ratio. Subsequently, corrective optics were inserted into the telescope which is now operating close to the original specifications. However, generalized RL methods and some new techniques based on projections onto convex sets have proved useful both for the present HST data, which are often insufficiently sampled, and also for many other classes of astronomical images. The ST-ECF staff have worked extensively in this and related areas, and some of these developments and their application to real data are described.

AB  - Summary In the horse, the phalanges are the second most common location for the occurrence of osseous cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) after the medial femoral condyle of the stifle. Phalangeal OCLLs occur in a variety of locations, most of which are adjacent to, if not communicating with, a joint. The aetiology of these lesions is considered to be multifactorial by most authors. Horses with OCLLs demonstrate lameness of varying severity. Diagnostic analgesia should be used to localise the lameness. After localisation of the lameness, standard radiographic views of the isolated area should be performed. The radiographic characteristics of OCLLs are dependent on the stage of development of the OCLL; OCLLs may first be identified as a small lucent flattening or depression in the articular surface; however, they may progress to a circular, oval or conical single or multi chambered radiolucency within the bone. There may be a rim of radiodense sclerosis around the lucency. Diagnosis of some OCLLs may only be achieved using nonstandard radiographic views or may require advanced diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of phalangeal cysts may be conservative or surgical. Surgical treatment options generally aim to prevent cyst enlargement and promote filling of the lesion with osseous material. Depending on the cyst, this can be performed arthroscopically or via an extra-articular approach. Occasionally, the severity of proximal interphalangeal joint OCLLs warrants surgical arthrodesis. Overall the prognosis for return to performance for horses with OCLLs ranges from 30?90% but is dependent on the breed, age and intended use of the horse, surface area of weightbearing cartilage affected, concurrent osteoarthritis within the joint and treatment administered.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease whose hallmark is the degeneration of articular cartilage. There is a worsening epidemic of OA in the United States today, with considerable economic costs. In order to develop more effective treatments for OA, noninvasive biomarkers that permit early diagnosis and treatment monitoring are necessary. T1rho and T2 mapping are two magnetic resonance imaging techniques that have shown great promise as noninvasive biomarkers of cartilage degeneration. Each of the two techniques is endowed with advantages and disadvantages: T1rho can discern earlier biochemical changes of OA than T2 mapping, while T2 mapping is more widely available and can be incorporated into existing imaging protocols in a more time-efficient manner than T1rho. Both techniques have been applied in numerous instances to study how cartilage is affected by OA risk factors, such as age and exercise. Additionally, both techniques have been repeatedly applied to the study of posttraumatic OA in patients with torn anterior cruciate ligaments.

AB  - Summary Quantitative neuroimaging techniques have become emerging technologies within clinical practice. In this paper, we survey a few clinical applications where quantification methods have received increasing attention, namely in the area of brain atrophy, lesion load computation and quantification of diffusion processes. We focus on the reliability and reproducibility of such methods and will use the example of quantitative diffusion tensor imaging to discuss methodological details. There, we show possible avenues for evaluating correctness and reliability. On the one hand, we show results from our novel hardware phantom experiments, where axonal fibres are emulated by synthetic industry fibres. On the other hand, we present a new framework for constructing software phantoms which can be used to evaluate, for example, the impact of partial volume effects in case of axonal loss as to be found in multiple sclerosis. Advantages and disadvantages as well as pitfalls of quantification and evaluation techniques are illustrated throughout the paper.

AB  - Introduction: A growing number of surgeons perform lymph node transfers for the treatment of lymphedema. When harvesting a vascularized lymph node groin flap (VGLNF) one of the major concerns is the potential risk of iatrogenic lymphedema of the donor-site. This article helps understanding of the lymph node distribution of the groin in order to minimize this risk. Materials and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing abdominal mapping by multi-detector CT scanner were included and 100 groins analyzed. The groin was divided in three zones (of which zone II is the safe zone) and lymph nodes were counted and mapped with their distances to anatomic landmarks. Further node units were plotted and counted. Results: The average age was 48 years. A mean number of nodes of 6.5/groin was found. In zone II, which is our zone of interest a mean of 3.1 nodes were counted with a mean size of 7.8?mm. In three patients no nodes were found in zone II. In five patients nodes were seen in zone II but were not sufficient in size or number to be considered a lymph node unit. On average the lymph node unit in zone II was found to be 48.3?mm from the pubic tubercle when projected on a line from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine, 16.0?mm caudal to this line, and 20.4?mm above the groin crease. On average the lymph node unit was a mean of 41.7?mm lateral to the SCIV-SIEV confluence. Conclusion: This study provides increased understanding of the lymphatic anatomy in zone II of the groin flap and suggests a refined technique for designing the VGLNF. As with any flap there is a degree of individual patient variability. However, having information on the most common anatomy and flap design is of great value.

AB  - Purpose:?? Lesions of the submandibular gland represent a pleomorphically diverse group making benign and malignant lesions difficult to differentiate from each other. The current series aims to identify the roles of pre-operative cytology and imaging with subsequent histopathology in the management of these lesions. Methods:?? Between 1998 and 2008 fifty-four patients, of median age 54?years (range 25?94), were retrospectively identified. Fifty patients underwent fifty-two surgical procedures involving the submandibular gland. The utility of imaging and cytology was analysed, and the accuracy of cytology correlated with histopathology. Results:?? Pathologies of resected specimens included: sialadenitis; 17 (32%), pleomorphic adenoma; 9 (17%), calculi; 8 (15%), lymphoma; 5 (10%) squamous cell carcinoma; 2 (4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma; 1 (2%) and other; 10 (20%). Twenty-eight patients (52%) underwent fine needle aspiration cytology/core biopsies; of these 25 proceeded to surgery. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of fine needle aspiration cytology correlation with histology were 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4% respectively. Overall, the complication rate was 9.6%. Conclusion:?? This series demonstrates histological outcomes in patients specific to the submandibular salivary gland for which there are few comparative series in the literature. The trans-cervical surgical approach to submandibular gland pathology is a safe and effective method with minimal morbidity. Combining investigative modalities and cytology optimises the diagnosis and management of submandibular salivary gland lesions.

AB  - Abstract Advanced therapies such as bioengineered skin substitutes (BSS) and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) have been shown to promote healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0·00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5·66; adjusted P: 1·3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0·30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·17?0·54; unadjusted P: 5·8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47·9 days (95% CI: 38·2?57·7) with Apligraf, 23·6 days (95% CI: 17·0?30·2) with EpiFix group and 57·4 days (95%CI: 48·2?66·6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3·2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2·5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0·0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.

AB  - Abstract Objectives One of the hallmarks of contemporary osteoporosis and bone loss is dramatically higher prevalence of loss and fragility in females post-menopause. In contrast, bioarchaeological studies of bone loss have found a greater diversity of age- and sex-related patterns of bone loss in past populations. We argue that the differing findings may relate to the fact that most studies use only a single methodology to quantify bone loss and do not account for the heterogeneity and complexity of bone maintenance across the skeleton and over the life course. Methods We test the hypothesis that bone mass and maintenance in trabecular bone sites versus cortical bone sites will show differing patterns of age-related bone loss, with cortical bone sites showing sex difference in bone loss that are similar to contemporary Western populations, and trabecular bone loss at earlier ages. We investigated this hypothesis in the Imperial Roman population of Velia using three methods: radiogrammetry of the second metacarpal (N?=?71), bone histology of ribs (N?=?70), and computerized tomography of trabecular bone architecture (N?=?47). All three methods were used to explore sex and age differences in patterns of bone loss. Results The suite of methods utilized reveal differences in the timing of bone loss with age, but all methods found no statistically significant differences in age-related bone loss. Discussion We argue that a multi-method approach reduces the influence of confounding factors by building a reconstruction of bone turnover over the life cycle that a limited single-method project cannot provide. The implications of using multiple methods beyond studies of bone loss are also discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) containing traces of iron oxide were functionalized by noncovalent lipid-PEG or covalent carboxylic acid function to supply new efficient MRI contrast agents for in vitro and in vivo applications. Longitudinal (r1) and transversal (r2) water proton relaxivities were measured at 300?MHz, showing a stronger T2 feature as an MRI contrast agent (r2/r1?=?190 for CO2H functionalisation). The r2 relaxivity was demonstrated to be correlated to the presence of iron oxide in the SWNT-carboxylic function COOH, in comparison to iron-free ones. Biodistribution studies on mice after a systemic injection showed a negative MRI contrast in liver, suggesting the presence of the nanotubes in this organ until 48?h after i.v. injection. The presence of carbon nanotubes in liver was confirmed after ex vivo carbon extraction. Finally, cytotoxicity studies showed no apparent effect owing to the presence of the carbon nanotubes. The functionalized carbon nanotubes were well tolerated by the animals at the dose of 10?µg?g?1 body weight. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Aims This study aimed at understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with inattention induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI). To eliminate the potential confounding caused by the heterogeneity of TBI, we focused on young adults postsports-related concussion (SRC). Methods Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were collected from 27 young adults post-SRC and 27 group-matched normal controls (NCs), while performing a visual sustained attention task. Task responsive cortical activation maps and pairwise functional connectivity among six regions of interest were constructed for each subject. Correlations among the brain imaging measures and clinical measures of attention were calculated in each group. Results Compared to the NCs, the SRC group showed significantly increased brain activation in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and increased functional connectivity between right inferior occipital cortex (IOC) bilateral calcarine gyri (CG). The left MFG activation magnitude was significantly negatively correlated with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in the NCs, but not in the patients. The right hemisphere CG-IOC functional connectivity showed a significant positive correlation with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in patients, but not in NCs. Conclusion The current data suggest that abnormal left MFG activation and hyper-communications between right IOC and bilateral CG during visual attention processing may significantly contribute to behavioral manifestations of attention deficits in patients with TBI.

AB  - We piloted three-dimensional (3D) body scanning in eating disorder (ED) patients. Assessments of 22 ED patients (including nine Anorexia Nervosa (AN) patients, 12 Bulimia Nervosa (BN) patients, and one patient with Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) and 22 matched controls are presented. Volunteers underwent visual screening, two-dimensional (2D) digital photography to assess perception and dissatisfaction (via computerized image distortion), and adjunctive 3D full-body scanning. Patients and controls perceived themselves as bigger than their true shape (except in the chest region for controls and anorexia patients). All participants wished to be smaller across all body regions. Patients had poorer veridical perception and greater dissatisfaction than controls. Perception was generally poorer and dissatisfaction greater in bulimia compared with anorexia patients. 3D-volume:2D-area relationships showed that anorexia cases had least tissue on the torso and most on the arms and legs relative to frontal area. The engagement of patients with the scanning process suggests a validation study is viable. This would enable mental constructs of body image to be aligned with segmental volume of body areas, overcoming limitations, and errors associated with 2D instruments restricted to frontal (coronal) shapes. These novel data could inform the design of clinical trials in adjunctive treatments for eating disorders.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate if pigment of a dark patch-test substance may affect assessment of perfusion with the laser Doppler imaging technique. Materials:? 13 subjects who previously patch-tested positive with 25% balsam of Peru in petrolatum were re-tested with the same test substance and petrolatum controls applied directly by transparent foils and with much weaker and less pigmented serial doses tested with polyester squares. Readings of perfusion were performed through the test substances and the transparent foils at time intervals up to 4 days while tests were applied and for 5 days following detachment of tests. The instrument set-up of the LDPI was the same as we have suggested for non-pigmented patch-test substances tested on white skin. Results:? Results show that pigment remnants following detachment of the dark pigmented and pasty test substance containing the petrolatum vehicle were prone to affect perfusion assessments by masking detection of perfusion of parts of test sites. A real masking effect is supported by a similar effect with readings of the same tests while they were applied and by no such observable effect with the petrolatum controls or the non-pasty and much less pigmented squares. Conclusion:? The results show that pigment of patch-test substances may affect perfusion assessments with the instrument set-up suggested for non-pigmented substances.

AB  - Abstract Background Intervention on small targets in the lung is difficult, leading our team to develop a highly accurate respiratory correlated image guided surgery (RCIGS) system. Methods Simulated point source targets were implanted into ex vivo porcine and human cadaver lungs attached to a ventilator. The RCIGS system was utilized to guide intervention in the presence of respiratory motion using a commercially available electromagnetic tracking solution. After intervention, the lungs were imaged to determine the target registration error between the target and needle. Results The system tumor position modeling had sub-mm accuracy. The mean intervention error for 12 porcine targets was 3.8?mm. The mean target registration error on four targets in a human cadaver was 4.0?mm at a mean depth of 9?cm. Conclusions The system provides an accuracy for intervention on targets of less than 1?cm in diameter at depths of up to 10?cm. A system of this accuracy outperforms current clinical standards.

AB  - Abstract Preparation of thin serial sections for comparative macromorphologic investigations has always represented a grave technical problem, especially in the case of regions in which bone as well as soft tissue are to be documented within their natural relations to each other in any desired sectional plane. Non-decalcified specimens up to the size of a whole cadaver are embedded in physiologic medium, precisely positioned, and deep-frozen to a specimen-ice block. A newly developed device, working on the basis of blades rotating at high speed, allows quick, successive removal of sections from the surface of the specimen block, with a thickness of each section infinitely variable between 0.1 and 5 mm. Following each cut, the new surface of the block can be documented photographically or on videotape for macromorphologic evaluation. So far more than 1,000 human, animal, and botanical specimens have been sectioned and evaluated with this method. In none of the cases were specimens damaged. Furthermore, any desired sectional plane could be adjusted; consequently a definite correlation between these sections and previous sonography, magnetic resonance (MR), or computed tomography (CT) images could be established. As serial cryosectioning becomes available to a far wider circle of medical and natural scientists, high-quality results should be obtained at lower costs. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Each year, exposure to violent trauma takes its toll on the development of millions of children. When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed. In spite of the serious psychiatric/developmental sequelae of violence exposure, the majority of severely and chronically traumatized children and youth are not found in mental health clinics. Instead, they typically are seen as the ?trouble-children? in schools or emerge in the child protective, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment, and criminal justice systems, where the root of their problems in exposure to violence and abuse is typically not identified or addressed. Usually, providers in all of these diverse service systems have not been sufficiently trained to know and identify the traumatic origins of the children's presenting difficulties and are not sufficiently equipped to assist with their remediation. This multiplicity of traumatic manifestations outside the mental health setting leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are dealing with a supra-clinical problem that can only be resolved by going beyond the child's individual clinical needs to enlist a range of coordinated services for the child and the family. This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.

AB  - Objectives Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is a known sequela of high-energy craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma and can result in stroke or death. The objective of this systematic review is to 1) identify CMF trauma patients who may benefit from BCVI screening and 2) describe the optimal diagnostic and treatment modalities. Study Design Systematic review of the literature (1946?2013). Methods An a priori study protocol was created using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The authors conducted a search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for articles related to BCVI and CMF fractures. All abstracts were reviewed, and data was extracted to determine the incidence of BCVI in the setting of CMF trauma. Individual fracture patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of CMF fracture-associated BCVI was 0.45%. The majority of patients (86.6%) sustained BCVI in the setting of high-energy trauma. The distribution of CMF fractures among BCVI patients was the mandible (12.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.8%). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was the most common diagnostic modality. A total of 63.1% of patients with BCVI were managed medically. The mortality among CMF patients with BCVI was 23.9%, and stroke rate was 47.1%. Conclusion Blunt cerebrovascular injury is a rare but devastating complication of blunt trauma. The recommended screening modality is CTA, and the most common treatment is antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated CMF injury associated with BCVI, highlighting the need for prospective trials to expand current screening criteria.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - Many computer assisted surgery systems are based on intraoperative x-ray images. To achieve reliable and accurate results these images have to be calibrated concerning geometric distortions, which can be distinguished between constant distortions and distortions caused by magnetic fields. Instead of using an intraoperative calibration phantom that has to be visible within each image resulting in overlaying markers, the presented approach directly takes advantage of the physical background of the distortions. Based on a computed physical model of an image intensifier and a magnetic field sensor, an online compensation of distortions can be achieved without the need of an intraoperative calibration phantom. The model has to be adapted once to each specific image intensifier through calibration, which is based on an optimization algorithm systematically altering the physical model parameters, until a minimal error is reached. Once calibrated, the model is able to predict the distortions caused by the measured magnetic field vector and build an appropriate dewarping function. The time needed for model calibration is not yet optimized and takes up to on a CPU. In contrast, the time needed for distortion correction is less than and therefore absolutely acceptable for intraoperative use. First evaluations showed that by using the model based dewarping algorithm the distortions of an XRII with a FOV could be significantly reduced. The model was able to predict and compensate distortions by approximately 80% to a remaining error of (max) ( rms).
