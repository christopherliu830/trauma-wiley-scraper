AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30 healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls, heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time, the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased. These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of paclitaxel administration using a novel drug delivery catheter for the prevention of restenosis in infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions. Background Restenosis continues to be a great challenge after percutaneous revascularization procedures for peripheral arterial disease, particularly for below-the-knee applications. Methods A prospective, multicenter first-in-human registry of a novel delivery catheter delivering liquid paclitaxel was conducted in 10 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint at 6 months was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and the primary safety endpoint at 1, 3, and 6 months were thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Twelve (n?=?12) lesions in ten patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 83.3?±?49.2 mm, with the lesion length range of 30mm to 182 mm. At 6-month follow-up, the rate of CD-TLR was 30% (3 of 10 patients). Zero patients (0 out of 10) demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up intervals. Conclusions This first in-human experience obtained in a multicenter study of real-world de novo and restenotic lesions demonstrates a favorable safety and efficacy profile at 6 months. Randomized comparison to current drug coated balloons should be performed to further validate this approach and positive experience.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Numerous factors may affect men's sexual experiences, including their health status, past trauma or abuse, medication use, relationships, mood, anxiety, and body image. Little research has assessed the influence of men's genital self-image on their sexual function or behaviors and none has done so in a nationally representative sample. Aims The purpose of this study was to, in a nationally representative probability sample of men ages 18 to 60, assess the reliability and validity of the Male Genital Self-Image Scale (MGSIS), and to examine the relationship between scores on the MGSIS and men's scores on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Methods The MGSIS was developed in two stages. Phase One involved a review of the literature and an analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Phase Two involved an administration of the scale items to a nationally representative sample of men in the United States ages 18 to 60. Main Outcome Measures Measures include demographic items, the IIEF, and the MGSIS. Results Overall, most men felt positively about their genitals. However, 24.6% of men expressed some discomfort letting a healthcare provider examine their genitals and about 20% reported dissatisfaction with their genital size. The MGSIS was found to be reliable and valid, with the MGSIS-5 (consisting of five items) being the best fit to the data. Conclusion The MGSIS was found to be a reliable and valid measure. In addition, men's scores on the MGSIS-5 were found to be positively related to men's scores on the IIEF.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relationship between mother and infant within multiproblem, so-called ?hard to reach? families. In an effort to understand factors contributing to problems in caring for the young children of these parents, a group of 47 families was recruited for study by the Clinical Infant Development Program of the National Institute of Mental Health. Serious social pathology was found within 75 percent of families. The lives of mothers in these families was marked by long term disruptions: 64 percent were from families characterized by recurring poverty and psychiatric illness, and 69 percent reported disruptions in parental care prior to age twelve, while more than two-thirds reported a history of being physically and/or sexually abused as children. More than 75 percent of this group of women presently showed psychiatric distress. Many of these women have difficulty in providing adequately for their young children and require innovative intervention programs in order to facilitate parenting.

AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

AB  - Summary Background The GlideScope Cobalt Video laryngoscope is being used more often in children with challenging laryngoscopy. There are, however, no pediatric trials comparing it to flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the current accepted gold standard. This preliminary manikin study compares the first-attempt intubation success of the GlideScope Cobalt video laryngoscope to the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope when performed by attending pediatric anesthesiologists at two major pediatric centers. Methods This prospective randomized, crossover study evaluated 120 attempts (60 with each study device) to intubate the AirSim Pierre Robin manikin (PRM) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and video laryngoscopy (VL). Attending pediatric anesthesiologists from two quaternary pediatric centers were eligible to participate. Each attending anesthesiologist randomly performed a single tracheal intubation attempt with one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation. Blinding was not feasible. We hypothesized that first-attempt success would be higher with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results Thirty anesthesiologists from each center were randomized to use one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. We analyzed all participants' data. There was no overall difference in first-attempt success between VL and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (88.3% vs 85% respectively, P = 0.59). There were significant institutional differences in first-attempt success using VL (76.7% vs 100%). Conclusions There was no difference in first-attempt success of tracheal intubation using VL vs fiberoptic bronchoscopy when performed by attending anesthesiologists at two large pediatric centers. However, institutional differences exist in success rates with VL across the two centers. Results from single-center device evaluations should be verified by multi-center evaluations. A significant proportion of attending anesthesiologists lack experience with advanced airway devices; targeted education may enhance intubation success and patient safety.

AB  - Verbal learning and memory deficits are among the most frequent in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and have been shown to be affected by deficits in other cognitive domains, such as information processing speed and executive functioning (EF). In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the differential impact that EF may exert on verbal learning and memory on both behavioural and neural levels. Seventy pwMS were assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including tests of verbal memory (Selective Reminding Test; SRT) and EF (Stroop test; Phonemic and Alternate Verbal Fluency; Modified Five-Point Test). Structural 3Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were available for 68 patients; cortical thickness of several frontal, pre-frontal, and hippocampal regions was calculated. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that patients' performance on Alternate Fluency Test predicted both their immediate (SRT-LTS: R2 = .38; p < .001; SRT-CLTR: R2 = .42; p < .001) and delayed (SRT-D: R2 = .39; p < .001) verbal memory performance. In addition, we found a significant relationship between the cortical thickness of the hippocampus and several bilateral frontal areas (i.e., anterior cingulate gyrus, superior and inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal cortex, and frontal pole) with verbal memory tests scores (SRT-LTS: R2 = .45; p < .001; SRT-CLTR: R2 = .52; p < .001; SRT-D: R2 = .49; p < .001). These behavioural and MRI results suggest that EF significantly impacts verbal memory performance in pwMS. The understanding of the complex interaction between these distinct cognitive domains can help foster the development of memory rehabilitation paradigms that take into account also the role of executive functioning.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Summary A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was referred for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging due to chronic left hindlimb lameness localised to the foot. On presentation, a previously undiagnosed draining tract was identified at the plantar aspect of the pastern. Radiographs revealed severe osteolysis of the navicular bone. Positive contrast MR fistulography was performed using a gadolinium based contrast agent following conventional MR imaging of the left hind foot. Fistulography allowed characterisation of a fistulous tract, which was closely associated with the deep digital flexor tendon, navicular bursa and osteomyelitis of the navicular bone.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Body image (BI) remains a significant survivorship challenge among breast cancer (BC) survivors. We describe an 8-week group intervention?restoring body image after cancer (ReBIC)?developed to target BI distress for BC survivors. Methods The intervention was informed by interviews with BC survivors and by a descriptive, exploratory approach which adapted guided imagery exercises to address BI. Educational material was selected to address sociocultural factors that may contribute to BI distress and affect adjustment. Videotape reviews and content analyses further refined the intervention. Results The intervention incorporates three active components: psychotherapeutic group principles; guided imagery exercises to address BI; and psychoeducation on relevant socialization factors and gender-based messages internalized by women in Western society. The therapeutic group was a supportive and effective way to assist BC survivors to gain insight on BI impacts, their histories, and relevant sociocultural factors contributing to BI distress. The group also facilitated the working through of grief over multiple losses. Guided imagery was well-received, and appeared to help survivors identify negative and emerging self-schema, as well as facilitate new self-views. Specific themes included negative emotions associated with an altered body and self, grief and loss, isolation, difficulties with sexual intimacy, relationship challenges, and uncertainty around sense of self and future. Conclusion An empirically tested group therapy intervention is described and has implications for survivorship programs to help address BI-related challenges. Future work could consider testing a similar approach tailored for other cancer populations.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT A multitude of morphological aspects of the human middle ear (ME) were studied qualitatively and/or quantitatively through the postprocessing and interpretation of micro-CT (micro X-ray computed tomography) data of six human temporal bones. The samples were scanned after phosphotungstic acid staining to enhance soft-tissue contrast. The influence of this staining on ME ossicle configuration was shown to be insignificant. Through postprocessing, the image data were converted into surface models, after which the approaches diverged depending on the topics of interest. The studied topics were: the ME ligaments; morphometric and mechanical parameters of the ossicles relating to inertia and the ossicular lever arm ratio; the morphology of the distal incus; the contact surface areas of the tympanic membrane (TM) and of the stapes footplate; and the thickness of the TM, round window of the cochlea, ossicle joint spaces, and stapedial annular ligament. Some of the resulting insights are relevant in ongoing discussions concerning ME morphology and mechanical functions, while other results provide quantitative data to add to existing data. All findings are discussed in the light of other published data and many are relevant for the construction of mechanical finite element simulations of the ME. J.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is a rapidly growing area, providing physicians with a valuable diagnostic tool for patient assessment. This paper describes a collaborative model, utilising radiology department ultrasound expertise, to train and credential physicians in PoCUS. A 6-year experience of the implementation and outcomes of the programme established within the emergency departments of a large, multi-campus hospital network are presented. Methods A collaborative model was initially developed and implemented between radiology and emergency departments. Key elements of the programme included hospital executive support, close collaboration with stakeholders, resource allocation, appointment of a sonographer educator, clear scope of practise and robust quality processes. Results Participation grew from 36 emergency physicians in 2011 to 96 physicians in 2016. A total 11064 scans were logged with the programme in the 6-year period. Routine quality audit of 61.8% (6836/11064) of all scans included 2836 Focussed Assessment by Sonography in Trauma (FAST) and 1422 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) examinations. False-positive or false-negative diagnoses occurred in 3.6% (102/2836) FAST and 1.3% (19/1422) AAA cases. No adverse clinical outcomes were reported to involve programme-compliant scans. Conclusion A collaborative model to train and credential physicians in PoCUS has been successfully implemented. The programme grew significantly, produced excellent quality outcomes and resolved many issues of potential conflict related to PoCUS.

AB  - Abstract An increase in the use of condoms by sexual offenders has been observed. This is likely to be due both to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and to prevent the transfer of DNA evidence. In this scenario the detection of condom lubricants at a crime scene could aid in proving corpus delicti. Here we show a novel application of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) for mapping the fingermark ridge pattern simultaneously to the detection of the condom lubricant within the fingermark itself. Two condom brands have been investigated to prove the concept. Condoms were handled producing lubricant-contaminated fingermarks. Images of the ridge pattern were obtained simultaneously to the detection of two lubricants, even several weeks after the fingermark deposition. The results therefore show the potential of MALDI MSI to link the suspect (identification through fingermark ridge pattern) to the crime (detection of condom lubricant) in one analysis. This would enable forensic scientists to provide evidence with stronger support in alleged cases of sexual assault. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Advanced medical imaging is beginning to make inroads into the practice of forensic pathology and medicine, including the associated disciplines of odontology and anthropology. Computed tomography (CT) imaging, in particular, has become a useful tool in medico-legal death investigation in many forensic institutes, and has wide applications in the field of forensic odontology. This chapter will discuss the development of CT imaging, its migration into the realm of forensic practice, and current uses of this technology in the conduct of post-mortem examinations. Particular emphasis will be given to its application to odontology in the areas of age estimation, identification, trauma analysis and Disaster Victim Identification.
