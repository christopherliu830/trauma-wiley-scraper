AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the presentation, diagnosis, cause, complications and outcome in 14 dogs that presented with a parotid sialocoele and that were treated by complete parotidectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-institutional retrospective study. RESULTS Each dog presented with a non-painful, fluctuant, soft tissue mass over the lateral aspect of the face in the region of the parotid salivary gland. Diagnosis was made by sialoradiography (3/14), CT (3/14), ultrasound (11/14) and MRI (2/14). The cause of the sialocoele could be determined in 8 of 14 patients and included: foreign body (2/14), sialolithiasis (1/14), neoplasia (3/14), salivary gland lipomatosis (1/14) and trauma (1/14). Treatment incurred one anaesthetic complication (regurgitation) and seven postoperative surgical complications [self-limiting seroma formation (2/14), haemorrhage (1/14), wound dehiscence (1/14), abscessation 7 months postoperatively (1/14) and facial nerve paralysis (2/14)]. Sialocoele did not recur in any dog during a median follow-up time of 14 months. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Parotidectomy has been considered a technically challenging procedure but can have a good success rate with long-term resolution of the clinical symptoms. Intra- and postoperative complications are reasonably common.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors??? Strauss RP, Ramsey BL, Edwards TC, Topolski TD, Kapp-Simon KA, Thomas CR, Fenson C, Patrick DL Objectives??? To describe stigma experiences of adolescents with congenital and acquired facial differences. Design??? Used baseline cross-sectional stigma-related responses from a four site (Seattle WA, Galveston TX, Chicago IL and Chapel Hill NC) US study enrolling 185 English speaking, US participants ages 11?18?years old with facial differences (60% male; 80% congenital conditions). Closed-ended, self-administered questions drawn from the Youth Quality of Life Instrument ? Facial Differences Module (YQOL-FD) determined perceptions of stigmatization. Mothers (n?=?153) were independently asked seven matching questions. Results??? Frequencies report combined responses of ?sometimes,??fairly often,? and ?very often.? Mother's responses are in parentheses. ?? 35% (47%) noticed people staring at their face in the past week. ?? 28% (43%) talked with others about how their face looks in the past month. ?? 29% (31%) heard others say something about their face in the past month. ?? 32% (32%) told peers about their facial difference in the past month. ?? 12% (12%) felt left out of doing things with peers because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 11% (8%) got into a fight because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 20% (18%) were teased about how their face looks in the past month. Conclusions??? Stigma experiences were frequently reported by youth with facial differences and were correlated with independent parental report. This level of stigma suggests that media and public health interventions may be warranted to reduce discrimination, prejudice and negative adolescent social experiences related to facial difference.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study aims to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) distress on body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression among breast cancer patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the breast cancer advocacy events held at 16 hospitals in Korea. Alopecia distress was assessed using the ?Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia Distress Scale?, body image and psychosocial well-being were measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and breast specific module (BR23), and depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Means of outcomes were compared between low and high CIA distress groups. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between the CIA distress and body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression. Results One hundred sixty-eight breast cancer patients participated in the study; the mean age was 48.4 (SD?=?8.4) years, and 55.3% of the patients experienced higher distress from alopecia. In fully adjusted models, the high distress group was more likely to have a poorer body image than the low distress group (35.2 vs. 62.0; p?<?0.001). Distressed patients were also more likely to report lower emotional (55.3 vs. 76.9; p?<?0.001), role (58.6 vs. 72.0; p?<?0.001), and social functioning (51.3 vs. 70.9; p?<?0.001). The high distress group was also more likely to have depression compared with the low distress group (19.6 vs. 14.8; p?<?0.001). Conclusions Chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress was negatively associated with body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression in women with breast cancer. It is necessary to develop specific interventions to minimize distress due to alopecia for women with breast cancer. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Degeneration of motor neurons and their associated axons is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but reliable noninvasive lesion detection is lacking. In vivo diffusion tensor imaging was performed to evaluate neurodegeneration in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord of wild-type and G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice, an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A statistically significant reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient was observed in the motor nuclei VII and XII of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice relative to wild-type mice. No significant difference in diffusion anisotropy was observed in dorsal white or gray matter in cervical and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. In contrast, statistically significant decreases in axial diffusivity (diffusivity parallel to the axis of the spinal cord) and apparent diffusion coefficient were found in the ventrolateral white matter of G93A-SOD1 mice in both the cervical and lumbar spinal cord. The reduction in axial diffusivity, suggestive of axonal injury, in the white matter of the spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 mice was verified by immunostaining with nonphosphorylated neurofilament. The present study demonstrates that in vivo diffusion tensor imaging-derived axial diffusivity may be used to accurately evaluate axonal degeneration in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract:? Mobile multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners are potentially available to temporary mortuaries and can be operational within 20?min of arrival. We describe, to our knowledge, the first use of mobile MDCT for a mass fatality incident. A mobile MDCT scanner attended the disaster mortuary after a five vehicle road traffic incident. Five out of six bodies were successfully imaged by MDCT in c. 15?min per body. Subsequent full radiological analysis took c. 1?h per case. The results were compared to the autopsy examinations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of imaging with mobile MDCT in relation to mass fatality work, illustrating the body pathway process, and its role in the identification of the pathology, personal effects, and health and safety hazards. We propose that the adoption of a single modality of mobile MDCT could replace the current use of multiple radiological sources within a mass fatality mortuary.

AB  - Sarcomas often occur in patients? extremities and treatment typically involves bone resection/limb salvage surgery. Such treatments leave survivors with physical disfigurements, functional disabilities, and/or emotional traumas. Our post-surgery psychological intervention investigated how these experiences impinge on sarcoma survivors? lives. Twenty-three survivors aged 19?60 years (M = 36 years) participated in a tri-disciplinary (rehabilitative exercise, plastic surgery and psychological) intervention. Of these, 17 participated in psychodynamic counselling, 10 completed a mental-health questionnaire and seven kept a reflective journal. An exemplar case study research design was employed and data were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. The findings reveal that survivors typically experience a number of body image issues and mobility difficulties, which they are reluctant to share with their oncologist in case they are viewed as being ungrateful or vain. In instances where such issues remain unaddressed, then sarcoma survivors have a tendency to adopt avoidant coping strategies and social isolation practices. These practices negatively impact on their mental health and functional quality of life. Hence, it is suggested that a short three part (body image, mobility, and coping strategy) screen be devised and used at all sarcoma 2-year follow-up assessment consults to identify which survivors are in need of psychological assistance.

Methods and results Randomized, controlled, multi-center prospective clinical trial with randomization 2:1 in favor of the OFFII. Primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of successful device placement and defect closure without major complications at hospital discharge. All data were assessed through a core laboratory. Interim analysis was performed when 70% of the patients were treated to evaluate for noninferiority. From a total of 176 randomized subjects, interim analysis was performed on the first 158 patients (65.2% female) (107 OFFII/51 ASO) undergoing device closure at a median weight of 42?kg (range 13-125?kg). Seventy-six percent (120 patients) completed 6-month follow-up. Successful device placement (first attempt) was achieved in 99.1% of the OFF group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.05). Early efficacy success was achieved in 94.4% of the OFFII group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.001). The incidence of major complications was 5.6% for the OFFII group compared to 9.8% for the ASO. Conclusions The OFFII device was not inferior to the ASO with less complications and greater efficacy than the ASO.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs at a high frequency in severe orthopaedic extremity injuries; however, the etiology of traumatic HO is virtually unknown. Osteogenic progenitor cells have previously been identified within traumatized muscle. Although the signaling mechanisms that lead to this dysregulated differentiation pathway have not been identified, it is assumed that inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute to an osteoinductive environment, are necessary for the development of HO. The hypothesis of this study was that cytokines related to chronic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and osteogenesis become up-regulated following severe muscle trauma where HO forms. Classification of these cytokines by their differential expression relative to control muscle will provide guidance for further study of the mechanisms leading to HO. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant up-regulation of cytokines typically associated with HO (e.g., BMP-4, as observed in the genetic form of HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva). Instead, the cytokine gene expression profile associated with the traumatized muscle included up-regulation of cytokines associated with osteogenesis and fibrosis (i.e., BMP-1 and TGF-?1). Using immunohistochemistry, these cytokines were localized to fibroproliferative lesions, which have previously been implicated in HO. This study identifies other cell and tissue-level interactions in traumatized muscle that should be investigated further to better define the etiology of HO. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background:?? Autologous reconstruction with the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator (DIEP) flap is increasingly utilized for breast reconstruction. However, situations arise in which the DIEP flap is not an appropriate option, including the presence of a midline abdominal scar or an inadequate volume of abdominal tissue. While other donor sites may be considered, the stacked DIEP flap, in which the perforators of both hemi-abdominal walls are utilized in a single vascular pedicle, provides a safe technique to utilize the integument of both hemi-abdominal walls. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a stacked DIEP flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the abdominal wall was undertaken, with each DIEA, its branching pattern, and all musculocutaneous perforating branches mapped using three-dimensional software reconstructions. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and guide planning for a stacked DIEP flap. Unique anatomy between individuals required a range of variations in flap anatomy, with the contralateral DIEA, SIEA, or perforators each used to perfuse the contralateral hemi-abdominal wall. There was a 100% flap survival, with no donor site morbidity reported. Conclusion:?? The stacked DIEP flap is a safe and reliable technique for augmenting the perfusion of the abdominal wall in cases where the single pedicle DIEP flap is limited. The anatomical basis of the flap can be planned preoperatively with CTA, facilitating faster operating times and good outcomes.

AB  - Objectives People living with HIV (PLWH) have multidimensional concerns requiring person-centred care. Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improves outcomes. No brief PROM currently reflects the breadth of concerns for PLWH. This study sought to identify priority outcomes for PLWH, model current practice, explore views on introducing PROMs into routine care, and devise a model for person-centred care incorporating the PROM. Methods A cross-national multi-centre study (London, Brighton and Dublin) was carried out. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with adult PLWH, HIV health care professionals and HIV commissioners (responsible for planning and commissioning services) were performed. Interviews were analysed using thematic and framework analysis. Results PLWH (n = 28), professionals (n = 21) and commissioners (n = 8) described concerns related to living with HIV across six domains: physical (e.g. pain and gastrointestinal symptoms), cognitive (e.g. memory and sleep), psychological (e.g. anxiety and depression), social (e.g. isolation and intimacy), welfare (e.g. finances and fears regarding change of immigration status), and information (e.g. long-term outcomes) needs. Themes were highly inter-related, impacting across domains of need (e.g. physical and cognitive problems impacting on psychological and social wellbeing). Perceived benefits of using PROMs in routine HIV care included improved person-centredness, patient empowerment, fewer missed concerns, increased engagement with services, and informed planning of services. Potential challenges included heterogeneity of PLWH, literacy, and utility for those who struggle to engage with care. Conclusions This study presents a novel model of person-centred care incorporating an HIV-specific PROM. The model reflects priorities of key stakeholders. Explicit use of PROMs in routine HIV care could afford benefits for PLWH, clinical teams and commissioners.

AB  - Abstract It has been argued that the new technologies of medicine privilege the image over the actual body and its experience, so that the patients themselves may ?vanish? behind the images. A case study is used to explore this from the patient?s point of view. What evidence is there that alienation or other dysfunctional effects can actually happen? In this example of the high-tech medicine of lung cancer treatment, it was demonstrable that the process of diagnosis was not only dependent on, but also in some ways distorted by, the reliance on technologies. It was not necessarily true, however, that the machines and the images themselves proved alienating to the patient, or produced a feeling of disembodiment. It was the system in which they were used, their translation into records and decisions, which was deeply alienating, with only lip-service paid to the principles of patient-centredness or the inclusion of the patient as a partner in decision making. Features of the contemporary British health service which seem to foster this are discussed.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Translations of summary In this paper, I propose a psychoanalytic reading of some of the writings of Amelia Rosselli, a trilingual poet who, at the age of seven, lost her father Carlo, who was persecuted and murdered by Mussolini's regime. History and her history conflate into personal and collective trauma which defies human possibilities to work through and mourn. Rosselli's work testifies to such predicament of the human subject of the 20th century, his/her dislocation, alienation and internal irreconcilable divisions. In particular I examine Diary in three tongues, which is the most autobiographical of her works and a self-analytic piece, written after the conclusion of her second analysis. In the Diary, Rosselli employs textual strategies which convey the fragmentation and destructuring of language, where her traumatic experience resides as a wound inflicted to the symbolic order. I propose that her writings contain her unconscious memories in an estranged and melancholic language which becomes the crucible to express her impossible mourning, in a complex mixture of Eros and Thanatos which allowed her to survive psychically and to create a very personal experimental poetic discourse which made her a literary figure of international acclaim. My primary engagement will be with Freud's theory of mourning and melancholia and its successive elaboration by Kristeva, who maintains that the melancholic discourse finds its expression in the pre-verbal and infra-verbal aspects of language, which she calls ?semiotics?, in dialectic articulation with its symbolic components. Drawing on literary texts, significant inferences can be made on the psychoanalytic listening to the prosodic aspects of language as the carrier of inchoate forms of representation of that which exceeds language: trauma, raw affects, mnemic traces, that is, the unrepresented and/or unrepresentable.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Traumatic occlusion (TO) can cause morphofunctional alterations that interfere in the homeostasis of the periodontium. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of TO on the periodontal repair process for teeth following subluxation. Materials and Methods Ninety Wistar rats aged 12 weeks were divided into three groups: control (C), subluxation (S) and subluxation with traumatic occlusion (S+TO). Subluxation was created with an impact force of 900 cN applied by a tensiometer and TO was created with a direct composite resin filling. Healing after two experimental periods of 7 and 21 days was assessed histologically. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post hoc tests were used for group comparison. Results At 7 days, there was a significant increase in periodontal ligament (PDL) width and amorphous fundamental substance, as well as a significant bone area reduction in groups S and S+TO. After 21 days, there was a significant PDL width increase in group S+TO, and in the percentage of collagen fibres in group S, whereas group S+TO showed a 52% bone area reduction compared to the same group at 7 days. Subluxation with or without TO caused only superficial root resorption. However, only group S+TO showed damage to the repair process of resorbed root areas after 21 days. Conclusion TO can increase damage to the PDL after subluxation and it can also delay the repair process after PDL damage.

AB  - Abstract Wrist tendons may be affected by a variety of pathologic conditions, including those caused by trauma and overuse, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, or infection. Sonography is a very sensitive means of detecting tendinous pathology because of its spatial resolution and its comparative and dynamic capabilities. Its wide availability makes it the preferred first-line imaging modality in the case of wrist pain. This article reviews the pathologic conditions that may involve the wrist and their sonographic appearances. ? 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound 32: 462?469, 2004

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent modality to depict and study the complex anatomy of the skull using multi-planar 2D images as well as 3D renderings. The foramina of the skull have been described on CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformations are rare in dogs; however, hypermotility or stenosis can cause severe neurologic compromise secondary to compression of the spinal cord. Atlantooccipital overlapping is rostral malposition of the atlas and axis resulting in compression of the cerebellum and kinking of the medulla oblongata. Benign calvarial hyperostosis has been described in young Bull Mastiffs as a diffuse thickening of the bones of the calvarium, with some similarities to craniomandibular osteopathy. Skull fractures due to trauma are best appreciated on CT images. CT features of osteomyelitis in the skull include soft tissue swelling, multifocal bone lysis with poorly defined cortical margins, regions of sclerosis, and irregular periosteal reaction.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.
