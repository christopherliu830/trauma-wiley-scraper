AB  - Purpose The ability to register image data to a common coordinate system is a critical feature of virtually all imaging studies. However, in spite of the abundance of literature on the subject and the existence of several variants of registration algorithms, their practical utility remains problematic, as commonly acknowledged even by developers of these methods. Methods A new registration method is presented that utilizes a Hamiltonian formalism and constructs registration as a sequence of symplectomorphic maps in conjunction with a novel phase space regularization. For validation of the framework a panel of deformations expressed in analytical form is developed that includes deformations based on known physical processes in MRI and reproduces various distortions and artifacts typically present in images collected using these different MRI modalities. Results The method is demonstrated on the three different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities by mapping between high resolution anatomical (HRA) volumes, medium resolution diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and HRA volumes, and low resolution functional MRI (fMRI) and HRA volumes. Conclusions The method has shown an excellent performance and the panel of deformations was instrumental to quantify its repeatability and reproducibility in comparison to several available alternative approaches.

AB  - Expensive telepathology programs are known for long. Instant messaging, in contrast, is a new trend that will permeate serious enterprises, including dermatopathology. We present an adaptation of microscopy to the MSN Messenger that allows simple and instant sharing of images through the Internet. Any digital camera can act as a webcam, even if no picture is taken. Images through a camera tethered to a microscope can be captured into the PC in real time as video. An inexpensive Belkin VideoBus II card (?$50) between the AV cable of the camera and the PC, using an USB port, is used as the capture device (among others). In the MSN Messenger v. 6.1, the Audio/Video Tuning Wizard (from ?Tools?) is notified that the Belkin capture mode will be used as video-composite input. The same card could optionally capture audio from any microphone. The above procedure will produce relatively high quality images in the Messenger image subwindow when the digital camera is activated. The interlocutor can broadcast images back. The only limitation is the relatively small size of the Messenger window. This is an example of current mass-appeal technologies that presage the marriage of teledermatopathology and instant messaging.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Abstract Acute cerebral lesions are associated with dysregulation of brain glucose homeostasis. Previous studies showed that knockdown of Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 impaired outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion and that widely expressed intracellular RS1 (RSC1A1) is involved in transcriptional and post-translational down-regulation of SGLT1. In the present study, we investigated whether SGLT1 is up-regulated during traumatic brain injury (TBI) and whether removal of RS1 in mice (RS1-KO) influences SGLT1 expression and outcome. Unexpectedly, brain SGLT1 mRNA in RS1-KO was similar to wild-type whereas it was increased in small intestine and decreased in kidney. One day after TBI, SGLT1 mRNA in the ipsilateral cortex was increased 160% in wild-type and 40% in RS1-KO. After RS1 removal lesion volume 1 day after TBI was reduced by 12%, brain edema was reduced by 28%, and motoric disability determined by a beam walking test was improved. In contrast, RS1 removal did neither influence glucose and glycogen accumulation 1 day after TBI nor up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-6 or microglia activation 1 or 5 days after TBI. The data provide proof of principle that inhibition or down-regulation of SGLT1 by targeting RS1 in brain could be beneficial for early treatment of TBI.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering is one of the most promising areas for treatment of various ophthalmic diseases particularly for patients who suffer from limbal stem cell deficiency and this is due to the lack of existence of appropriate matrix for stem cell regeneration. The aim of this research project is to design and fabricate triple layered electrospun nanofibers as a suitable corneal tissue engineering scaffold and the objective is to investigate and perform various in vitro tests to find the most optimum and suitable scaffold for this purpose. Electrospun scaffolds were prepared in three layers. Poly(d, l-lactide-co-glycolide; PLGA, 50:50) nanofibers were electrospun as outer and inner layers of the scaffold and aligned type I collagen nanofibers were electrospun in the middle layer. Furthermore, the scaffolds were cross-linked by 1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and glutaraldehyde. Structural, physical, and mechanical properties of scaffolds were investigated by using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, tensile test, degradation, shrinkage analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, capability to support cell attachment and viability were characterized by SEM, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. According to the result of Brunauer?Emmett?Teller analysis, specific surface area of electrospun scaffold was about 23.7 m2 g-1. Tensile tests on cross-linked scaffolds represented more suitable hydrophilicity and tensile behavior. In addition, degradation rate analysis indicated that noncross-linked scaffolds degraded faster than cross-linked one and cross-linking led to controlled shrinkage in the scaffold. The SEM analysis depicted nano-sized fibers in good shape. Also, the in vitro study represented an improved cell attachment and proliferation in the presence of human endometrial stem cells for both cross-linked and noncross-linked samples. The current study suggests the possibility of producing an appropriate substrate for successful cornea tissue engineering with a novel design.

AB  - Abstract. An accurate assessment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is essential in ensuring correct and timely treatment of this potentially blinding condition. Current modes of assessment are based upon clinical grading by expert examination of retinal changes. However, this may be subjective, unreliable and difficult and there has been significant interest in alternative means of measurement. These have been made possible through technological advancements in image capture and analysis as well as progress in clinical research, highlighting the specific importance of plus disease in ROP. Progress in these two fields has highlighted the potential for digital image analysis of plus disease to be used as an objective, reliable and valid measurement of ROP. The potential for clinical and scientific advancement through this method is argued and demonstrated in this article. Along with the potential benefits, there are significant challenges such as in image capture, segmentation, measurement of vessel width and tortuosity; these are also addressed. After discussing and explaining the challenges involved, the research articles addressing digital image analysis of ROP are critically reviewed. Benefits and limitations of the currently published techniques for digital ROP assessment are discussed with particular reference to the validity and reliability of outcome measures. Finally, the general limitations of current methods of analysis are discussed and more diverse potential areas of development are discussed.

AB  - Aim:? Functional neuroimaging studies to date have indicated prefrontal dysfunction in late-onset major depression (LOD). The relationships between prefrontal dysfunction and clinical characteristics including social functioning, however, have been unclear. The objective of the present study was to evaluate prefrontal hemodynamic response related to an executive task in LOD and to assess the relationship between activation in the prefrontal regions and clinical characteristics including social functioning. Methods:? Twenty-four subjects with LOD and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the present study. Hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal and superior temporal cortical surface area were measured during verbal fluency task (VFT) using 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which enables real-time monitoring of cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the cortical surface area. Results:? The two groups had a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of oxy-hemoglobin concentration change; LOD patients had less activation in a broad area covering both prefrontal and superior temporal cortices than healthy controls. In addition, reduced activation of the frontopolar region had a significant positive correlation with lower self-assessment of social functioning scores in the patient group. Conclusion:? Reduced frontopolar cortical activation was associated with social functioning impairment in patients with LOD, and NIRS may be an efficient clinical tool for monitoring these characteristics.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate: (1) the feasibility of MR microscopy T2* mapping by performing a zonal analysis of spatially matched T2* maps and histological images using microscopic in-plane pixel resolution; (2) the orientational dependence of T2* relaxation of the meniscus; and (3) the T2* decay characteristics of the meniscus by statistically evaluating the quality of mono- and biexponential model. Methods Ultrahigh resolution T2* mapping was performed with ultrashort echo time using a 7 Tesla MR microscopy system. Measurement of one meniscus was performed at three orientations to the main magnetic field (0, 55, and 90°). Histological assessment was performed with picrosirius red staining and polarized light microscopy. Quality of mono- and biexponential model fitting was tested using Akaike Information Criteria and F-test. Results (1) The outer laminar layer, connective tissue fibers from the joint capsule, and the highly organized tendon-like structures were identified using ultra-highly resolved MRI. (2) Highly organized structures of the meniscus showed considerable changes in T2* values with orientation. (3) No significant biexponential decay was found on a voxel-by-voxel?based evaluation. On a region-of-interest?averaged basis, significant biexponential decay was found for the tendon-like region in a fiber-to-field angle of 0°. Conclusion The MR microscopy approach used in this study allows the identification of meniscus substructures and to quantify T2* with a voxel resolution approximately 100 times higher than previously reported. T2* decay showed a strong fiber-to-field angle dependence reflecting the anisotropic properties of the meniscal collagen fibers. No clear biexponential decay behavior was found for the meniscus substructures.

AB  - Recently, using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SRXRF), the copper accumulation in rat aortic elastin and copper topography in human THP-1 cell monolayer have been described. However, it is necessary to locate more accurately cellular copper in the vascular cells and tissues. In the current study, SRXRF coupling with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to image copper in sections of human THP-1 cells and mouse aorta. The results showed that sections of 1?µm thickness are required for SRXRF producing a correlative image with TEM between copper topography and cellular ultrastructure. As compared with SRXRF alone, coupling TEM with SRXRF can clearly identify the location of copper in the nucleus and nucleolus in non-dividing THP-1 cell sections, and can differentiate the copper location at elastic laminae from collagen in mouse aortic sections. Thus, these results revealed new information about the copper topography in vascular cells and tissues and highlighted the potential of TEM-SRXRF to investigate the role of copper in macrophage and aortic homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract We examined the correlation between brain perfusion and age using pulsed arterial spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance images (MRI) in a large number of healthy children. We collected data on brain structural and ASL perfusion MRI in 202 healthy children aged 5?18 years. Structural MRI data were segmented and normalized, applying a voxel-based morphometric analysis. Perfusion MRI was normalized using the normalization parameter of the corresponding structural MRI. We calculated brain perfusion with an adjustment for gray matter density (BP-GMD) by dividing normalized ASL MRI by normalized gray matter segments in 22 regions. Next, we analyzed the correlation between BP-GMD and age in each region by estimating linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial functions, using the Akaike information criterion. The correlation between BP-GMD and age showed an inverted U shape followed by a U-shaped trajectory in most regions. In addition, age at which BP-GMD was highest was different among the lobes and gray matter regions, and the BP-GMD association with age increased from the occipital to the frontal lobe via the temporal and parietal lobes. Our results indicate that higher order association cortices mature after the lower order cortices, and may help clarify the mechanisms of normal brain maturation from the viewpoint of brain perfusion.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - The world has seen a major increase in forced displacement since 2011. As a growing number of states implement restrictive refugee policies, public communication has become essential for refugee organisations. This study analysed, therefore, three international refugee organisations? discursive strategies towards the recent Syrian crisis, as well as their production and the social context. A critical discourse analysis of international press releases (N=122) and six semi-structured interviews with press and regional officers revealed that the observed actors largely dehumanise displaced people and subordinate them to the ?Western self? and state interests; displaced people hardly ever acquire their own voice. The study found that the medium characteristics of press releases and the importance of media attention result in a depersonalising humanitarian discourse. In addition, there were indications of a post-humanitarian discourse that reproduced the humanitarian sector's ?marketisation?. Finally, the examined organisations use the political realist cross-issue persuasion strategy, displaying displaced people as resettlement objects.

AB  - Abstract Background To date, the reliability of ultrasound imaging (USI) measures of the abdominal muscles in children and adolescents during the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test has not been confirmed. Objective To assess the intra-rater reliability of USI measures of the thickness and percentage thickness change of the external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and transversus abdominis (TrA) on both sides of the body during the ASLR test in healthy adolescents. Design Single-group repeated-measures intra-rater reliability study. Setting School. Participants Thirty-nine adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 years. Methods Three repeated USI measurements were recorded in the supine resting position and during the ASLR test at 2 sessions, 6 to 8 days apart. In the supine position, measurements were collected at the end of normal expiration. In the case of ASLR, measurements were collected when the person undergoing examination touched the transverse delimiter with the distal part of their lower leg, that is, to a 30° flexion of the hip. Main Outcome Measurements USI of abdominal muscle thickness. Results By using the mean of 3 measures in the supine, resting position, intra-examiner reliability point estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]3.3) ranged from 0.95 to 0.97 for EO, IO, and TrA. During the ASLR test, the ICC result of thickness measurements of all muscles was also above 0.90. In terms of percentage change of muscle thickness, the highest ICC3.3 result obtained for the TrA was 0.81-0.85; for EO the result ranged from 0.72-0.89, and the result for the IO was between 0.65 and 0.79. Conclusion USI measurements of the thickness of the EO, IO, and TrA muscles at rest and during the ASLR test in healthy adolescents between 13 and 16 years of age are reliable. Because of an increase in the precision of measurements, we recommend using the mean of 3 consecutive measurements of the EO, IO, and TrA muscles in adolescents to ensure a good reliability level. Based on 3 consecutive measurements, good reliability for the percentage change in the TrA thickness was achieved.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - Abstract Background and purpose Abdominal organ motion seriously compromises the targeting accuracy for particle therapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study compares three different abdominal corsets regarding their ability to reduce pancreatic motion and their potential usability in particle therapy. Materials and methods A patient-individualized polyurethane (PU), a semi-individualized polyethylene (PE), and a patient-individualized three-dimensional-scan based polyethylene (3D-PE) corset were manufactured for one healthy volunteer. Time-resolved volumetric four-dimensional-magnetic resonance imaging (4D-MRI) and single-slice two-dimensional (2D) cine-MRI scans were acquired on two consecutive days to compare free-breathing motion patterns with and without corsets. The corset material properties, such as thickness variance, material homogeneity in Hounsfield units (HU) on computed tomography (CT) scans, and manufacturing features were compared. The water equivalent ratio (WER) of corset material samples was measured using a multi-layer ionization chamber for proton energies of 150 and 200 MeV. Results All corsets reduced the pancreatic motion on average by 9.6 mm in inferior?superior and by 3.2 mm in anterior-posterior direction. With corset, the breathing frequency was approximately doubled and the day-to-day motion variations were reduced. The WER measurements showed an average value of 0.993 and 0.956 for the PE and 3DPE corset, respectively, and of 0.298 for the PU corset. The PE and 3DPE corsets showed a constant thickness of 2.8 ± 0.2 and 3.8 ± 0.2 mm, respectively and a homogeneous material composition with a standard deviation (SD) of 31 and 32 HU, respectively. The PU corset showed a variable thickness of 4.2 ? 25.6 mm and a heterogeneous structure with air inclusions with an SD of 113 HU. Conclusion Abdominal corsets may be effective devices to reduce pancreatic motion. For particle therapy, PE-based corsets are preferred over PU-based corset due to their material homogeneity and constant thickness.

AB  - Exercise-induced changes of transverse proton relaxation time (T2), tissue perfusion and metabolic turnover were investigated in the lower back muscles of volunteers by applying muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before and after as well as dynamic 31P-MRS during the exercise. Inner (M. multifidus, MF) and outer lower back muscles (M. erector spinae, ES) were examined in 14 healthy young men performing a sustained isometric trunk-extension. Significant phosphocreatine (PCr) depletions ranging from 30% (ES) to 34% (MF) and Pi accumulations between 95% (left ES) and 120%?140% (MF muscles and right ES) were observed during the exercise, which were accompanied by significantly decreased pH values in all muscles (?pH?≈??0.05). Baseline T2 values were similar across all investigated muscles (approximately 27?ms at 3?T), but revealed right?left asymmetric increases (T2,inc) after the exercise (right ES/MF: T2,inc?=?11.8/9.7%; left ES/MF: T2,inc?=?4.6/8.9%). Analyzed muscles also showed load-induced increases in molecular diffusion D (p?=?.007) and perfusion fraction f (p?=?.002). The latter parameter was significantly higher in the MF than in the ES muscles both at rest and post exercise. Changes in PCr (p?=?.03), diffusion (p?<?.01) and perfusion (p?=?.03) were strongly associated with T2,inc, and linear mixed model analysis revealed that changes in PCr and perfusion both affect T2,inc (p?<?.001). These findings support previous assumptions that T2 changes are not only an intra-cellular phenomenon resulting from metabolic stress but are also affected by increased perfusion in loaded muscles.

AB  - Abstract Purpose? Child sexual abuse (CSA) is rarely addressed in the Arab world. This study examined the prevalence, risk factors and consequences associated with CSA in Lebanese children before, during and after the 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli war. Method? A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered an interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire. Results? In total, 249 (24%) children reported at least one incident of CSA; 110 (11%) occurred before the war, 90 (8%) took place in the 1-year period after the war to the time of the data collection and 49 (5%) occurred during the 33-day war. There were no gender differences in CSA reports before or after the war, but boys reported more incidents during the war than did girls. Girls who reported CSA had higher trauma-related symptoms for sleep disturbance, somatization, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and anxiety than did boys. There were geographic differences in the reports of abuse that may be associated with poverty and living standards. Logistic regression analyses correctly classified 89.9% of the cases and indicated that children's age, family size, fathers' education level and family functioning significantly predicted CSA during the period following the war. Conclusions? The prevalence of CSA in the current study is within the reported international range. Given the increase in the incidents of CSA during the war and the significant findings for family-related risk factors, there is an urgent need to provide multi-component culturally appropriate interventions that target the child and the family system in times of peace and conflict.

AB  - Cartilage is one of the most essential tissues for healthy joint function and is compromised in degenerative and traumatic joint diseases. There have been tremendous advances during the past decade using quantitative MRI techniques as a noninvasive tool for evaluating cartilage, with a focus on assessing cartilage degeneration during osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, after a brief overview of cartilage composition and degeneration, we discuss techniques that grade and quantify morphologic changes as well as the techniques that quantify changes in the extracellular matrix. The basic principles, in vivo applications, advantages, and challenges for each technique are discussed. Recent studies using the OA Initiative (OAI) data are also summarized. Quantitative MRI provides noninvasive measures of cartilage degeneration at the earliest stages of joint degeneration, which is essential for efforts toward prevention and early intervention in OA.

AB  - Summary Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) was developed by the American College of Radiology to standardize breast imaging reporting. Whenever possible, mammography and ultrasound BI-RADS lexicon language is incorporated into the breast MR lexicon (e.g., shape and margin analysis). This chapter presents the key facts of breast MR interpretation and reporting breast MR. In breast MR lexicon lesion type imaging, three types of findings are reported: foci, mass, and non-mass-like enhancement. The chapter illustrates them in a table. It also discusses nipple retraction and invasion, extramammary findings, and kinetic assessment. Key facts and MRI features of common benign breast lesions and BI-RADS assessment categories are also presented.

AB  - We aimed to determine the sensitivity of available ?diagnostic? tests in detecting subclinical abnormalities characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with unexplained isolated myelopathy, and any relationship between test results and level of disability. The trial investigations were carried out in 69 prospectively selected patients with acute or chronic noncompressive myelopathies. Magnetic resonance scans were the most sensitive individual tests, revealing asymptomatic brain lesions in 51 patients (74%, C.I. 64?84). An abnormal IgG/albumin ratio (IgG/A) was present in 29 (42%, C.I. 30?54), oligoclonal bands (OCB) in 27 (39%, C.I. 17?39) and abnormal evoked potentials (EP) (visual and/or auditory brain stem) in 19 cases (28%, C.I. 17?39). OCB and abnormal EP were found significantly less often than in control patients with clinically definite MS (CDMS) and significantly more often than in patients with myelopathy due to other conditions. The number of anatomical brain areas with lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was significantly associated with CSF abnormalities; abnormal EP were correlated with abnormal MRI and elevated CSF immunoglobulins. Clinical classifications, age, symptom duration, disability levels and genetic factors did not appear to influence the prevalence of abnormal MRI or CSF. For the exclusion of compressive and structural diseases of the spinal cord, myelography has been superceded by cervical and thoracic MRI. In addition, MRI of the brain is the investigation of choice in patients with myelopathies that remain unexplained after spinal MRI. However, whether used alone or in combination with other tests, the specificity and predictive value of brain MRI abnormalities for the risk of developing MS, as well as the associated ?false positive? rates, remain to be defined by long-term follow-up of prospectively ascertained and representative cases.
