AB  - Abstract Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), further mild impacts can exacerbate negative outcomes. To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p > 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic volumetric CT in the assessment of the paediatric airway. Methods Ethics board approval was obtained for this retrospective review. Eight infants (median age 6 months, range 3 weeks to 1 year, 50% female) at a tertiary paediatric centre with complex clinical respiratory presentation underwent volumetric CT assessment of their airways. The entire lungs were examined over 1?2 respiratory cycles. In four patients, intravenous contrast was administered to assess for vascular airway compression. The patients were not intubated. CT findings were correlated with bronchography and bronchoscopy, where available. Results Two patients had diffuse tracheobronchomalacia associated with chronic lung disease. One patient demonstrated focal severe cervical tracheomalacia. One patient had a double aortic arch causing fixed narrowing with superimposed malacia of the distal trachea. Four patients had normal airways; one with chronic lung disease, one demonstrating air trapping. CT findings were concordant with bronchography (one case) and bronchoscopy (four cases) in all but one (CT negative, bronchoscopy positive) but did not alter patient management. Conclusion The assessment of the paediatric airway, and in particular for tracheobronchomalacia, is difficult. Assessment with bronchography, bronchoscopy, helical CT and MR have issues with reliability, intubation, intratracheal/bronchial contrast administration and ionising radiation. Volumetric CT assesses the entire central airway in children at much lower radiation dose compared with previous dynamic CT imaging. This non-invasive, rapid assessment obviates the need for patient cooperation and enables evaluation of extratracheal intrathoracic structures. Volumetric CT enables four-dimensional assessment for paediatric tracheobronchomalacia without intubation or patient cooperation and at low radiation dose.

AB  - Abstract Objective To characterize the effects of caregiver mental health and coping strategies on interactions with an injured adolescent acutely after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design Multi-site, cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient setting of 3 tertiary pediatric hospitals and 2 tertiary general medical centers. Participants Adolescents (N = 125) aged 12-17 years, 1-6 months after being hospitalized with complicated mild to severe TBI. Methods Data were collected as part of a multi-site clinical trial of family problem-solving therapy after TBI. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of caregiver and environmental characteristics to the dimensions of effective communication, warmth, and negativity during caregiver-adolescent problem-solving discussions. Main Outcomes Measures Adolescent and caregiver interactions, as measured by the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales. Results Caregivers who utilized problem-focused coping strategies were rated as having higher levels of effective communication (P < .01), as were those with higher socioeconomic status (P < .01). Problem-focused coping style and higher socioeconomic status were also associated lower levels of negative interactions (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Female gender of the adolescent and fewer children in the home were associated with increased parental warmth during the interaction (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Neither adolescent TBI severity nor caregiver depression significantly influenced caregiver-teen interactions. Conclusions Problem-focused coping strategies are associated with higher levels of effective communication and lower levels of caregiver negativity during the initial months after adolescent TBI, suggesting that effective caregiver coping may facilitate better caregiver-adolescent interactions after TBI.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively useful sonographic diagnostic criteria for testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma and to determine significant predictors among the criteria. Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

Materials and Methods This work was approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant. Five healthy right-handed men (age range, 24?37 years) were studied and written informed consent was obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging data acquired with 1-mm slice thickness at a 3.0 Tesla (T) clinical MRI scanner were prepared and analyzed using tractography methods to reconstruct the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways which included the fronto-ponto-cerebellar, parieto-ponto-cerebellar, occipito-ponto-cerebellar, and temporo-ponto-cerebellar tracts. Results We demonstrate the feasibility of tractographic mapping and quantification of the four cortico-ponto-cerebellar system components based on their cortical connections in the healthy human brain using DTI data with thin 1-mm sections. Conclusion In vivo quantification of different cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways based on cortical connection is feasible, using 1-mm slices at 3.0T. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Objective:? Bone involvement in chronic renal failure is manifested long before the initiation of dialysis and is more prevalent in patients receiving inadequate conservative phase management. This study aimed at identifying the extent of renal bone disease among pre-dialysis and maintenance dialysis patients. Method: Thirty-two patients (gr 1) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for variable period of time were compared to twenty newly detected, irregularly treated, (gr 2) pre-dialysis severe renal failure patients for their clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. Result:?Mean age of gr 1 and gr 2 patients was 45?±?14 vs. 34?±?15 years (p?<?0.05). Comparison of blood biochemistry between group 1 and 2 showed serum creatinine 9.9?±?2.9 vs. 13.4?±?4.4?mg/dl (P?<?0.01), calcium 10?±?1.4 vs. 7.4?±?1?mg/dl (p?<?0.001); phosphate 4.4?±?1 vs. 8?±?2?mg/dl (p?<?0.008); ionized calcium 4.7?±?0.1 vs. 3.9?±?0.7?mg/dl (p?<?0.05); alkaline phosphatase 116?±?31 vs. 86?±?31?IU/l (p?<?0.05); and iPTH 72?±?48 vs. 147?±?92?pg/ml (p?<?0.05). Radiological changes present in the two groups were osteopenia-63% vs. 65%(P?=?NS); trabecular resorption-53% vs. 20%(p?<?0.05); soft tissue calcification-31% vs. 10%(p?<?0.05); bone cyst-16% vs. 25%(P?=?NS) and subperiosteal bone resorption-16% vs. 20%(P?=?NS). Tc 99MDP bone scan combined in both groups of patients (n?=?52) showed increased uptake in wrist joint (29%), tibia-fibula (25%), costochondral junction, vertebral column (15% each), sternum (13%), radius and ulna (10%), and calvaria and mandible (8% each). X-ray finding was positive for bone involvement in 59% cases and Tc 99 scan was positive in 80%(p?<?0.05). Association study showed iPTH had a negative correlation with serum calcium (r?=??0.5, p?<?0.05) and a positive correlation with serum phosphate (r?=?0.7, p?<?0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (r?=?0.9, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:?It is concluded that pre-dialysis newly detected renal failure patients may present with deranged calcium homeostasis and can manifest high prevalence of bone involvement when compared to maintenance hemo-dialysis patients.

AB  - Abstract Child abuse is a significant social and public health problem in many societies. One particular form of physical abuse is inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI) ? the so-called ?Shaken Baby Syndrome?. One of the key features associated with ITBI is characteristic ocular findings ? only observed on fundal examination. It is crucial not to miss the diagnosis of ITBI as there may be implications for the safety of the child. The ophthalmologist is one key contributor to the process required to make the diagnosis of ITBI accurately and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. This article discusses some medicolegal implications of examining a child with retinal haemorrhages in the context of suspected ITBI, with practical advice for the ophthalmologist to be as objective and prepared as possible. The scientific validity of some alternative explanations advanced in court is discussed, with a strong emphasis on the literature.

AB  - Abstract Methamphetamine abuse and dependence, frequently accompanied by schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms [methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP)], is a serious public health problem worldwide. Few studies, however, have characterized brain dysfunction associated with MAP, nor investigated similarities and differences in brain dysfunction between MAP and schizophrenia. We compared prefrontal cortical activity associated with stop-signal inhibitory task in 21 patients with MAP, 14 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Both the MAP and the schizophrenia groups showed significantly reduced activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared with controls; however, only the MAP group showed reduced activation in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex. The MAP group demonstrated significant positive correlations between task performance and hemodynamic responses in the bilateral ventrolateral, polar and left dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. The MAP and schizophrenia groups demonstrated a significant difference in the relationship of impulsivity to hemodynamic changes in the bilateral premotor cortex. These findings characterize similarities and differences in prefrontal cortical dysfunction between psychosis associated with methamphetamine and schizophrenia. The reduced hemodynamic changes in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex suggest a common underlying pathophysiology of MAP and schizophrenia, whereas those in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex point to an impaired state that is either inherent or caused specifically by methamphetamine use.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Steady increase in computed tomography (CT) utilisation in the ED was observed in countries such as the USA, Canada, China and Korea; however, limited empirical data are available regarding Taiwan. Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify and compare trends in CT utilisation in the ED over a 5 year period in a medical centre in Taiwan. Methods Electronic chart review was performed in a medical centre with an annual ED census of 80 000 patients. Subjects >20 years of age who underwent CT scans during ED visits from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were identified. Results Among the 333 673 adult ED visits, 43 635 received CT scans, with a utilisation rate of 131 per 1000. Within the 5 year span, patient volume increased by 7.7%, whereas CT utilisation increased by 42.7%. The rates of increase in patient volume and CT utilisation were 5.0% and 32.4% in non-trauma; 19.7% and 97.8% in trauma. CT scans were mostly performed on the head (47%), abdomen (36%), followed by chest (10%) and miscellaneous (7%). An increase of 168% in spinal CTs for trauma patients was observed. An increase in CT utilisation was found in all age groups with a proportionate increase with increasing age in both trauma and non-trauma. Conclusion ED CT utilisation has increased at a rate far exceeding the growth in ED patient volume. This may be attributed to the improved utility of CT in diagnosing serious pathology, more diagnostic indications for CT, ready availability and the necessity for diagnostic certainty in the ED.

AB  - Clinically the outcome of pressure ulcers is predicted by the severity/stage of the ulcer, patient health and health care options. These factors, however, cannot be used to accurately evaluate the prognosis and healing in these ulcers, thus delaying any required change in the treatment plan. Techniques are needed that can help in the assessment of healing and improve the clinical management of these ulcers. Studies of tissue health such as angiogenesis, by measuring blood flow in the ulcer at different time points, has been examined as a way to evaluate the state of healing ulcers. Although the Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager (LDPI) has been used to assess various wounds, there is a need to validate it as a predictor of wound healing. The standard clinical outcome parameter for skin wounds has been time to heal. To validate the LDPI as predictor of healing, however, a measure that gives periodic feedback such as healing rate is a more useful outcome measure. The goal of this study therefore was to determine a protocol for the LDPI and evaluate its ability to predict healing in pressure ulcers. Previous studies have indicated that perfusion values obtained after heat stress may reflect the blood flow more accurately than absolute perfusion values. It was hypothesized that the difference in the blood perfusion after heat provocation is expected to correlate with the healing rate. The selected heat provocation (increase of 20?°F) was evaluated on five spinal cord injured pressure ulcer patients. The LDPI assessment and healing rate measurements were done weekly for 5 weeks. Preliminary results suggest a relationship between the difference in the perfusion and the healing rate for the following week. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact relationship. This tool has the potential to play a critical role in the clinical management of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract The unconscious impact of differences in culture and social class is discussed from the perspective of an analyst practising in London whose ?foreign accent? prevents patients from placing her within the social stratifications by which they feel confined. Because she is seen by them as an analyst from both ?inside? and ?outside? the British psycho-social fabric and cultural complex, this opens a space in the transference that enables fuller exploration of the impact of the British social class system on patients? experience of themselves and their world. The paper considers this impact as a trans-generational trauma of living in a society of sharp socio-economic divisions based on material property. This is illustrated with the example of a patient who, at the point of moving towards the career to which he aspired, was unable to separate a sense of personal identity from the social class he so desperately wanted to leave behind and walk the long avenue of individuation. The dearth of literature on the subject of class is considered, and the paper concludes that not enough attention is given to class identification in training.

AB  - Aim: To review the practice and implications of performing computed tomography (CT) for patients with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. Methods: Patients admitted for RIF pain between July 1998 to April 2000 were classified clinically as having appendicitis, equivocal appendicitis or other conditions. They would all undergo CT abdomen and then managed accordingly. The accuracy of clinical and CT diagnosis were compared, with histology of the resected appendix as gold standard. Results: There were 348 patients with RIF pain and 201 of them underwent CT abdomen. Appendicitis was diagnosed clinically in 45 patients, the remaining patients were either equivocal or suspicious of other conditions. From CT abdomen 82 were diagnosed to be appendicitis and 119 were found to be normal or having other pathology. For those with radiological appendicitis, 74 were proven on histology (sensitivity = 85%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 90% (74/82)). Within the clinical appendicitis group, 37 were confirmed by histology (PPV of clinical diagnosis = 82% (37/45)). Among the equivocal group, 50 patients turned out to be appendicitis. Conclusion: Although CT is useful in diagnosing appendicitis, we do not recommend routine CT abdomen for patients with RIF pain as no significant additional benefit is seen in the group of patients with clinical appendicitis. However, there may be a role for it in patients with equivocal clinical features but a randomized clinical trial is needed for further evaluation.

AB  - Introduction The impact of cervical pathology on performance is of great importance to the equine industry. Accurate diagnosis of cervical disease with imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, requires thorough appreciation of normal cervical anatomy. The objectives of this study were to describe in detail the 3-dimensional anatomy of the equine cervical spine by comparing anatomical sections with corresponding MR and contrast-enhanced CT images in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and to determine the ability of MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging to visualize anatomical structures in the cervical spine. Methods Three cervical spines of young adults (3?8 years), were collected immediately after humane euthanasia. The spine was stabilized on a frame in a natural flexed position with an angle of 20-degrees. MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed within 6 hours after euthanasia. Anatomical sections of 1?cm were made in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and compared with corresponding CT and MR images. The intervertebral disk thickness, facet joint angle, amount of cerebrospinal fluid and amount of synovial fluid within each facet joint were quantified. Results The anatomical locations of clinically important structures including the facet joints, spinal cord, cervical nerve roots and intervertebral disks were reliably identified in the anatomical sections and their corresponding MR images. Contrast-enhanced CT images depicted all osseous borders; MR images were superior for soft tissue structures. Conclusions This study enhances the understanding of normal cervical spine anatomy and the diagnostic usefulness of cervical MRI and contrast-enhanced CT in the horse. Ethical animal research This study was approved by the animal care and use committee of the Mississippi State University, MS, USA. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Abstract Research in humans and animals has shown that negative childhood experiences (NCE) can have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain. Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs.

AB  - Psychological theorizing about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has developed considerably since early behavioural formulations (Brewin, Dalgleish,  Mowrer, 1960) and there have been parallel developments in biological understanding (Yehuda, 1998). However clinical practice has not been affected by the new psychobiology. It is suggested that it is possible to translate this new understanding into a clinically useful analogy that will help circumvent the difficulties of forming a therapeutic alliance with trauma victims which have been reported (Pitman et al., 1991; Scott & Stradling, 1997).
