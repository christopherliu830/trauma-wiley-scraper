AB  - Abstract Quantitative diffusion imaging is a powerful technique for the characterization of complex tissue microarchitecture. However, long acquisition times and limited signal-to-noise ratio represent significant hurdles for many in vivo applications. This article presents a new approach to reduce noise while largely maintaining resolution in diffusion weighted images, using a statistical reconstruction method that takes advantage of the high level of structural correlation observed in typical datasets. Compared to existing denoising methods, the proposed method performs reconstruction directly from the measured complex k-space data, allowing for Gaussian noise modeling and theoretical characterizations of the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed images. In addition, the proposed method is compatible with many different models of the diffusion signal (e.g., diffusion tensor modeling and q-space modeling). The joint reconstruction method can provide significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio relative to conventional reconstruction techniques, with a relatively minor corresponding loss in image resolution. Results are shown in the context of diffusion spectrum imaging tractography and diffusion tensor imaging, illustrating the potential of this signal-to-noise ratio-enhancing joint reconstruction approach for a range of different diffusion imaging experiments.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 188?192 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and psychological characteristics of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients with trauma history. Materials and methods:? The clinical and psychological characteristics of 34 TMD patients with trauma history were compared with those of 340 TMD patients without trauma history. Craniomandibular index (CMI) was used for clinical characteristics of TMD patients. Symptom severity index (SSI) was used to assess the multiple dimensions of pain. Symptom checklist-90-revision (SCL-90-R) was used for psychological evaluation. Results:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed significantly higher CMI and palpation index. TMD patients with trauma history also exhibited higher values in duration, sensory intensity, affective intensity, tolerability, scope of symptom, and total SSI score. In addition, these patients showed significantly higher values in symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Among the symptom dimensions of SCL-90-R, somatization showed the most significant correlations with CMI and SSI. Conclusions:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed more severe subjective, objective, and psychological dysfunction than those without trauma history. Pain of myogenous origin, history of physical trauma, and psychosocial dysfunction were all closely related.

AB  - The anatomy of the cervical spine musculature visible on magnetic resonance (MR) images is poorly described in the literature. However, the correct identification of individual muscles is clinically important because certain conditions of the cervical spine, for example whiplash associated disorders, idiopathic neck pain, cervical nerve root avulsion and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, are associated with different morphological changes in specific muscles visible on MR images. Knowledge of the precise structure of different cervical spine muscles is crucial when comparisons with the contralateral side or with normal are required for accurate description of imaging pathology, management and assessment of treatment efficacy. However, learning the intricate arrangement of 27 muscles is challenging. A multi-level cross-sectional depiction combined with three-dimensional reconstructions could facilitate the understanding of this anatomically complex area. This paper presents a comprehensive series of labeled axial MR images from one individual and serves as a reference atlas of the cervical spine musculature to guide clinicians, researchers, and anatomists in the accurate identification of these muscles on MR imaging.

AB  - Summary Traumatic accidents are responsible for almost half of deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Motor vehicles are most commonly involved, with pedestrian accidents being a leading cause in the 5?9-year age group. Injuries to the urinary tract and associated complications remain a source of significant morbidity following trauma in the pediatric age group. The kidney is also the most commonly injured abdominal organ in children. This chapter reviews the presentation and evaluation of pediatric traumatic injuries of the kidney and evaluates current treatment options. The current evolving literature on nonoperative management of even high-grade renal injuries is reviewed. Ureteral and bladder trauma will also be reviewed.

AB  - Diffusion-weighted imaging, a contrast unique to MRI, is used for assessment of tissue microstructure in vivo. However, this exquisite sensitivity to finer scales far above imaging resolution comes at the cost of vulnerability to errors caused by sources of motion other than diffusion motion. Addressing the issue of motion has traditionally limited diffusion-weighted imaging to a few acquisition techniques and, as a consequence, to poorer spatial resolution than other MRI applications. Advances in MRI imaging methodology have allowed diffusion-weighted MRI to push to ever higher spatial resolution. In this review we focus on the pulse sequences and associated techniques under development that have pushed the limits of image quality and spatial resolution in diffusion-weighted MRI.

AB  - Abstract This work demonstrates the potential of ultrashort TE (UTE) imaging for visualizing graft material and fixation elements after surgical repair of soft tissue trauma such as ligament or meniscal injury. Three asymptomatic patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using different graft fixation methods were imaged at 1.5T using a 3D UTE sequence. Conventional multislice turbo spin-echo (TSE) measurements were performed for comparison. 3D UTE imaging yields high signal from tendon graft material at isotropic spatial resolution, thus facilitating direct positive contrast graft visualization. Furthermore, metal and biopolymer graft fixation elements are clearly depicted due to the high contrast between the signal-void implants and the graft material. Thus, the ability of UTE MRI to visualize short-T2 tissues such as tendons, ligaments, or tendon grafts can provide additional information about the status of the graft and its fixation in the situation after cruciate ligament repair. UTE MRI can therefore potentially support diagnosis when problems occur or persist after surgical procedures involving short-T2 tissues and implants. J. Magn. Reson.

Methods A four-echo gradient-echo sequence was implemented on a 7T scanner. The first echo was used to create TOF-MRA images, while the remaining echoes were combined to visualize CMBs and veins on SWI images. The sequence was evaluated on eight brain tumor patients with known radiation-induced CMBs. Single-echo images were also acquired to visually and quantitatively compare the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of small- and intermediate-vessels between acquisitions. The number of CMBs detected with each acquisition was also quantified. Statistical significance was determined using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Compared with the single-echo sequences, the CNR of small and intermediate arteries increased 7.6% (P?<?0.03) and 9.5% (P?=?0.06), respectively, while the CNR of small and intermediate veins were not statistically different between sequences (P?=?0.95 and P?=?0.46, respectively). However, these differences were not discernible by visual inspection. Also the multi-echo sequence detected 18.3% more CMBs (P?<?0.008) due to higher slice resolution. Conclusion The proposed 7T multi-echo sequence depicts arteries, veins, and CMBs on a single image to facilitate quantitative evaluation of radiation-induced vascular injury. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Summary Comorbidity of trauma and PTSD with addictive disorders is common in adolescents. The interrelationship between the two conditions is complex with addictive behaviors following the trauma, as well as preceding it. While there are established treatments for each of the conditions separately, few treatments addressing the comorbidity have been developed and tested. Little is known about the impact of the comorbid addictive disorders and trauma-related disorders on the adolescent developmental trajectory, the ability of the adolescents to acquire crucial psychosocial skills in the face of these twin disorders. In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated.

AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and is a leading cause of presentations to emergency departments. Understanding the epidemiology of TBI can aid in improving overall management and identifying opportunities for prevention. Currently, there is a paucity of data on paediatric TBI in NSW. The purpose of this study was to determine the demographics, causes, treatment and outcome of TBI at The Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW), a large trauma referral paediatric hospital. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted to CHW emergency from 2006 to 2011 with a TBI. Patients who presented to the emergency department and had a history of TBI with either symptoms of concussion and/or positive computed tomography (CT) findings of head injury were selected. Information regarding demographics, injury pattern, CT findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Results Over the 6-year period, there were 1489 presentations at the CHW. Of these, 65% were male and 35% were female. The mean age was 7 years. A total of 93% were classified as mild, 1.5% as moderate and 5.5% as severe. Sports and recreational injuries accounted for 26% of all TBI presentations, while motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) accounted for 77% of all TBI deaths. Sixty-two per?cent of children underwent a CT brain, and of those, 40% were normal. Conclusion The majority of TBI are mild in nature, with younger children and males at greatest risk. There was a low rate of operative intervention and a high rate of good outcomes. Many injuries may be preventable with the adaptation of better public health education programmes, particularly in very young children and those related to MVAs.

AB  - Abstract Background To investigate the prevalence of findings of spinal injury on computed tomography (CT) images of pediatric trauma patients and to define indicators for the possible presence of spinal injuries. Methods Spinal CT for pediatric trauma patients (age ≤ 12 years) over a 2-year period was retrospectively evaluated for the presence of findings suggestive of spinal injury. Results Of the 773 patients reviewed, 19 (2.4%) showed traumatic spinal lesions on their spinal CT images. These patients were significantly older than those without spinal lesions (mean age 7.9 ± 3.3 years vs 6.1 ± 3.3 years; P = 0.02). The prevalence of spinal trauma was significantly lower in patients aged 0?8 years than in those aged 9?12 years (P = 0.025). Spinal injury was significantly higher in female patients (P = 0.014). Most of the spinal injuries were located at the lumbar and sacral vertebral levels, and most did not cause neurological complications or require surgical treatment. Important indicators of the possible presence of spinal injuries were pain, tenderness, or ecchymosis over the spine, a low Glasgow Coma Scale score (≤12), head injury (for cervical injuries), or intrathoracic injuries and pelvic fractures (for lumbar and sacral injuries). Conclusions Most spinal CT examinations for the diagnosis of spinal injuries in children did not show positive findings. Thus, many children were exposed to an unnecessary high dose of radiation. New clinical evaluation criteria and indicators should be defined to diagnose spinal injuries and avoid unnecessary radiological examinations.

AB  - Abstract Much of the theoretical focus in post-traumatic stress disorder has been on the role of the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Crucially, in unresolved traumatic experiences that underlie clinical presentations, this focus misses the brain areas key to the defence responses of fight, flight and freeze?and the associated affects of anger, fear and grief. The periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, with the hypothalamus, is essential for these somatic and emotional responses to traumatic experiences. We argue that when treatment approaches thought to work at the higher brain levels have been ineffective, it is because they have failed to engage the midbrain and hypothalamic sources of the affective responses to the trauma and to the memory of it. Basic affects have been so overwhelming that dissociation, or a similarly protective neurochemical capping mechanism, has prevented full resolution of the affective content of the adversity. Treatment with the Comprehensive Resource Model? (CRM) aims to clear the clinically relevant residues of adverse experiences by resolving the emotional responses accessed through the body memories. When the trauma has led to overwhelming distress, and/or dissociation, there is a necessity for robust resourcing to be in place before the emotional intensity of that distress is accessed. Resourcing needs to be as proximal to the re-experience as possible to promote complete resolution and in some psychotherapy modalities, the supports provided are somewhat remote from the crucial moments of processing. Therefore, we describe how the CRM seeks to have robustly resourced states present concurrently with traumatised states to avoid overwhelming emotional distress. This allows safe entry into the deepest pain residual from the traumatic event so that it is not overwhelming during processing of the memory, and does not lead to further dissociation, allowing the individual to remain fully present throughout. This ?stepping into the affect? can then be so rapidly effective that we also argue that CRM is not an exposure treatment; re-orientation to the deepest content of the experience resolves the residual distress quickly and permanently through memory reconsolidation. Re-learning at upper brain levels will then follow from the revoking of the affective power, which has previously driven stimulus/context and response learning in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Introduction Haemophilia is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders in the Emergency Department (ED). The most dangerous site of bleeding is the central nervous system. Aims To describe the characteristics of haemophiliacs arrived to our ED following a head trauma and to analyse the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Retrospective, analytical, observational study, conducted in a Paediatric ED. We included haemophilic patients aged from birth to 16 years who consulted after a head trauma over a 6-year period. Data collected included age, type of haemophilia and head trauma, symptoms, prophylaxis status, CT imaging, treatment and number of visits to the ED. Results About 46 males and 85 episodes were analysed. The median age was 2.38 years. Severe haemophilia A was the most frequent type of disease (50%). All head injuries were mild, and the most frequent mechanism was a collision with an object (38.8%). In 62 episodes (72.9%) the patients were asymptomatic. The rest 23 events had symptomatology, being the most common headache (26%), emesis (21.7%) and drowsiness (17.4%). Head CT was obtained in 31 episodes, founding altered results in 10 (6 of them corresponding to ICH). All the patients with ICH had symptomatology. About 37 episodes required admission. Conclusion Intracranial haemorrhage is one of the most dangerous events in haemophiliacs and it may occur after a head trauma. Our study suggests that, in case of head trauma, CT must be obtained in symptomatic patients and in those with additional risk factors. Asymptomatic patients must have prolonged observation.

AB  - Objectives:? This study examined: (i) the prevalence of trauma in a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, and (ii) how trauma histories mediated by interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence impact on the severity of BD. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its relationship to outcomes in BD were also examined. Methods:? Sixty participants were recruited from a geographically well-defined mental health service in Northern Ireland. Self-reported trauma histories, PTSD, interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence and were examined in relation to illness severity. Results:? A high prevalence of trauma was found. Trauma predicted the frequency of hospital admissions (R2?=?0.08), quality of life (R2?=?0.23) and inter-episode depressive symptoms (R2?=?0.13). Interpersonal difficulties, but not alcohol dependence, appeared to play an important role in mediating these adverse effects. While only 8% of the sample met criteria for active PTSD, this comorbid disorder was associated with BD severity. Conclusions:? This study indicates that awareness of trauma is important in understanding individual differences in bipolar presentations. The theoretical and clinical implications of evidence that trauma is related to more adverse outcomes in BD are discussed. The finding that interpersonal difficulties mediate the relationship between trauma and BD severity is novel. The need for adjunctive evidence-based treatments targeting interpersonal difficulties is considered.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.
