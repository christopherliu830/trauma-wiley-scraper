AB  - Background/aim Research into the paid employment of people with spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury is prevalent; however, little research has examined the factors that may support employment for adults with a concomitant spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury (dual diagnosis). This study aimed to determine the level of paid employment reported by people with dual diagnosis and to explore contextual factors that supported paid employment. Methods This cross-sectional cohort study recruited 30 participants with dual diagnosis from a specialist spinal rehabilitation unit. Interviews were conducted during the first five years post-rehabilitation discharge to determine level of paid employment and contextual factors that supported employment. Results At interview, 47% of participants were in paid employment. Employment type at interview indicated a shift away from more physically intensive jobs. Employed and unemployed participants reported a high level of social support and reported experiencing few physical or attitudinal barriers in their day to day lives. These environmental factors did not differentiate between employed and unemployed participants (z range = ?0.98 to ?0.17; P value range = 0.33?0.86). The most common facilitator of employment identified by participants was the personal factor ? motivation (93% of employed participants). Conclusion When considering the impact of contextual factors on paid employment for people with a dual diagnosis of spinal cord injury/traumatic brain injury, personal factors may be of greater influence than environmental factors. Study participants experienced few physical or attitudinal barriers and reported highly supportive interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Abstract Background The intranasal (IN) route for rapid drug administration in patients with brain disorders, including status epilepticus, has been investigated. Status epilepticus is an emergency, and the IN route offers a valuable alternative to other routes, especially when these fail. Objectives To compare IN versus IV midazolam (MDZ) at the same dosage (0.2?mg/kg) for controlling status epilepticus in dogs. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 44) with idiopathic epilepsy, structural epilepsy, or epilepsy of unknown origin manifesting as status epilepticus. Methods Randomized parallel group clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to the IN-MDZ (n = 21) or IV-MDZ (n = 23) group. Number of successfully treated cases (defined as seizure cessation within 5?minutes and lasting for ≥10?minutes), seizure cessation time, and adverse effects were recorded. Comparisons were performed using the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests with statistical significance set at α?<?.05. Results IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ successfully stopped status epilepticus in 76% and 61% of cases, respectively (P = .34). The median seizure cessation time was 33 and 64?seconds for IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively (P = .63). When the time to place an IV catheter was taken into account, IN-MDZ (100?seconds) was superior (P = .04) to IV-MDZ (270?seconds). Sedation and ataxia were seen in 88% and 79% of the dogs treated with IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Both routes are quick, safe, and effective for controlling status epilepticus. However, the IN route demonstrated superiority when the time needed to place an IV catheter was taken into account.

AB  - Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide range of disabilities that cause life-long cognitive impairment and social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are important for improving the life quality of autistic patients. However, in the current practice, diagnosis often has to be delayed until the behavioral symptoms become evident during childhood. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for identifying high-risk ASD infants at as early as six months after birth. This is based on the observation that ASD-induced abnormalities in white matter (WM) tracts and whole-brain connectivity have already started to appear within 24 months after birth. In particular, we propose a novel multikernel support vector machine classification framework by using the connectivity features gathered from WM connectivity networks, which are generated via multiscale regions of interest (ROIs) and multiple diffusion statistics such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and average fiber length. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76% and an area of 0.80 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in comparison to the accuracy of 70% and the AUC of 70% provided by the best single-parameter single-scale network. The improvement in accuracy is mainly due to the complementary information provided by multiparameter multiscale networks. In addition, our framework also provides the potential imaging connectomic markers and an objective means for early ASD diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4880?4896, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Much of the extant literature addressing the psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2 mutation testing and risk management aggregates mutation carriers of all ages in study recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation. This analytic strategy does not adequately address the needs of the youngest genetic testing consumers, i.e., women aged 18?25. Despite low absolute cancer risk estimates before age 30, BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women aged 18?25 feel vulnerable to a cancer diagnosis but find themselves in a management quandary because the clinical utility of screening and prevention options are not yet well defined for such young carriers. We present three cases, selected from a larger study of 32 BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women who completed or considered genetic testing before age 25, to demonstrate the unique developmental, relational and temporal influences, as well as the challenges, experienced by very young BRCA mutation-positive women as they complete genetic testing and initiate cancer risk management. The first case describes the maturation of a young woman whose family participated in a national cancer registry. The second addresses the experiences and expectations of a young woman who completed genetic testing after learning that her unaffected father was a mutation carrier. The third case highlights the experiences of a young woman parentally bereaved in childhood, who presented for genetic counseling and testing due to intense family pressure. Together, these cases suggest that BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18?25 are challenged to reconcile their burgeoning independence from their families with risk-related support needs. Loved ones acting in ways meant to care for these young women may inadvertently apply pressure, convoluting family support dynamics and autonomous decision-making. Ongoing support from competent healthcare professionals will enable these young women to remain informed and receive objective counsel about their risk-management decisions.

AB  - Purpose: AAPM Task Group 111 proposed to measure the equilibrium dose-pitch product for scan modes involving table translation and the midpoint dose DL(0) for stationary-table modes on the central and peripheral axes of sufficiently long (e.g., at least 40 cm) phantoms. This paper presents an alternative approach to calculate both metrics using the measurements of scanning the standard computed tomographic (CT) dosimetry phantoms on CT scanners. Methods: was calculated from CTDI100 and ε(CTDI100) (CTDI100 efficiency), and DL(0) was calculated from and the approach to equilibrium function H(L) = DL(0)/Deq, where Deq was the equilibrium dose. CTDI100 may be directly obtained from several sources (such as medical physicist's CT scanner performance evaluation or the IMPACT CT patient dosimetry calculator), or be derived from CTDIVol using the central to peripheral CTDI100 ratio (R100). The authors have provided the required ε(CTDI100) and H(L) data in two previous papers [X. Li, D. Zhang, and B. Liu, Med. Phys. 39, ? (2012) 10.1118/1.3678990; X. Li, D. Zhang, and B. Liu, Med. Phys., 031903 (10pp.) (2013) 10.1118/1.4790470]. R100 was assessed for a series of GE, Siemens, Philips, and Toshiba CT scanners with multiple settings of scan field of view, tube voltage, and bowtie filter. Results: The calculatedDL(0) and DL(0)/Deq in PMMA and water cylinders were consistent with the measurements on two GE CT scanners (LightSpeed 16 and VCT) by Dixon and Ballard [Med. Phys. 34, 3399?3413 (2007) 10.1118/1.2757084], the measurements on a Siemens CT scanner (SOMATOM Spirit Power) by Descamps et al. [J. Appl. Clin. Med. Phys. 13, 293?302 (2012) 10.1120/jacmp.v13i6.3934], and the Monte Carlo simulations by Boone [Med. Phys. 36, 4547?4554 (2009) 10.1118/1.3223634]. Conclusions: and DL(0) can be calculated using the alternative approach. The authors have provided the required ε(CTDI100) and H(L) data in two previous papers. R100 is presented for a majority of multidetector CT scanners currently on the market, and can be easily assessed for other CT scanners or operating conditions not covered in this study. The central to peripheral Deq ratio is about 1.50 and 1.12 times of R100 for the 32- and 16-cm diameter PMMA phantom, respectively.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at a high incidence, involving millions of individuals in the U.S. alone. Related to this, there are large numbers of litigants and claimants who are referred annually for forensic evaluation. In formulating opinions regarding claimed injuries, the present review advises experts to rely on two sets of information: TBI outcome and neuropsychological dose?response studies of non-litigants and non-claimants, and response bias literature that has demonstrated the relatively high risk of invalid responding among examinees referred within a secondary gain context, which in turn has resulted in the development of specific assessment methods. Regarding prospective methods for detecting possible response bias, both symptom validity tests, for measuring over-reporting of symptoms on inventories and questionnaires, and performance validity tests, for measuring insufficient effort on ability tests, are considered essential.

AB  - ABSTRACT Understanding the anatomical variations in the human cochlea is important for cochlear implants. This study examined these variations using a reconstructed fusion model of the skull and temporal bone. The three-dimensional (3D) digital model of the temporal bone was reconstructed from multiple axial micro-computed tomography (CT) scans of temporal bone and high resolution CT of the skull from 15 cadavers. A skull model was reconstructed and merged with the reconstructed temporal bone. The 3D relationship between the cochlea and the skull's mid-sagittal plane was analyzed. The α and ? angles of the cochlear autogenous rotation and bottom position, respectively, further subdivided the cochlear spatial orientation. The relationship between the base of the cochlea and the round window was evaluated with the Φ angle. Cochlear size was measured and the relationship was statistically analyzed. Cochlear implant electrode arrays were observed in five cases of right-temporal bone specimens. The α, ?, and Φ angles were 46.01?±?9.65, 56.79?±?3.58, and 44.41?±?7.23, respectively. The α angle varied greatly and was negatively correlated to the Φ angle (correlation coefficient?=??0.211, P < 0.05). Among the five specimens, the α and Φ angle of the 2R and 4R cochlear specimens was lower and higher than the mean value, respectively. These measurements revealed variations in the size and position of the cochlea. Some of these variations may require surgical adjustments for insertion of electrodes with cochlear implants and present a greater challenge for implantation of cochlear electrode implantation. These data also provide a better understanding of variations in human cochlear anatomy. Anat Rec, 301:1086?1095, 2018. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Inhibitory control describes a number of distinct processes. Effortless inhibition refers to acts of control that are automatic and reflexive. Effortful inhibition refers to voluntary, goal-directed acts of control such as response flexibility, interference control, cancellation inhibition, and restraint inhibition. Disruptions to a number of inhibitory control processes occur as a consequence of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper reviews the current knowledge of inhibition deficits following childhood TBI, and includes an overview of the inhibition construct and a discussion of the specific deficits shown by children and adolescents with TBI and the factors that mediate the expression of these deficits, including injury-related variables and the expression of pre- and post-injury attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The review illustrates that inhibitory control processes differ in terms of measurement, assessment, and neurological underpinnings, and also that childhood TBI may selectively disrupt particular forms of inhibition.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Abstract The salience network (SN) is mainly involved in detecting and filtering multimodal salient stimuli, and mediating the switch between the default mode network and central executive network. Early studies have indicated a right-sided dominance in the functional organization of the SN; however, the anatomical basis of the functional lateralization remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that the structural connectivity profile between the frontoinsular cortex (FIC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which are two core hubs of the SN, is also dominant in the right hemisphere. Based on diffusion and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) of adult healthy volunteers in independent datasets, we found a stable right-sided laterality of both the FIC-dACC structural and functional connectivity in both the human connectome project cohort and a local Chinese cohort. Furthermore, a significant effect of aging on the integrity of the right FIC-dACC structural connectivity was also identified. The right-sided laterality of the structural organization of the SN may help us to better understand the functional roles of the SN in the normal human brain.

AB  - Abstract Identifying differential responses between sexes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can elucidate the mechanisms behind disease pathology. Peripheral and central inflammation in the pathophysiology of TBI can increase sleep in male rodents, but this remains untested in females. We hypothesized that diffuse TBI would increase inflammation and sleep in males more so than in females. Diffuse TBI was induced in C57BL/6J mice and serial blood samples were collected (baseline, 1, 5, 7 days post-injury [DPI]) to quantify peripheral immune cell populations and sleep regulatory cytokines. Brains and spleens were harvested at 7DPI to quantify central and peripheral immune cells, respectively. Mixed-effects regression models were used for data analysis. Female TBI mice had 77%?124% higher IL-6 levels than male TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, whereas IL-1? and TNF-α levels were similar between sexes at all timepoints. Despite baseline sex differences in blood-measured Ly6Chigh monocytes (females had 40% more than males), TBI reduced monocytes by 67% in TBI mice at 1DPI. Male TBI mice had 31%?33% more blood-measured and 31% more spleen-measured Ly6G+ neutrophils than female TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, and 7DPI, respectively. Compared with sham, TBI increased sleep in both sexes during the first light and dark cycles. Male TBI mice slept 11%?17% more than female TBI mice, depending on the cycle. Thus, sex and TBI interactions may alter the peripheral inflammation profile and sleep patterns, which might explain discrepancies in disease progression based on sex.

AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com

AB  - Abstract A topical trend in clinical research has been the study of repeat trauma, referred to by clinicians as ?injury recidivism,? which lends itself to the assessment of accumulated injuries among ancient people. The present investigation examined the healed injuries among two archaeological skeletal samples from the Kerma period (ca. 2500?1500 BC) of Sudanese Nubia. Both groups were known to have a high prevalence of multiple trauma?80% of 54 adults from the rural sites (O16 and P37) located near Dongola and 42% of 212 adults from the urban site of Kerma sustained nonfatal injuries. It was observed that a higher frequency of multi-injured adults displayed one or more violence-associated injury (cranial trauma, parry fracture). When all injuries were considered 38% of individuals with violence-related injuries had other traumatic lesions in contrast to 22% of individuals who experienced injuries associated with accidental falls (e.g., Colles', Smiths', Galeazzi, and paired forearm fractures), although this difference was not significant. When only the skulls and long bones were evaluated 81% of adults with multiple injuries to these major bones bore one or more violence-related injuries, while 60% of adults with single injuries sustained violence-related injuries. Most individuals with multiple injuries were male and less than 35 years of age; there was no significant difference in the frequency of violence- or accident-related multiple injury between the rural and urban communities. Although it cannot be established whether or not some of an individual's injuries were experienced during simultaneous or independent incidents, the pattern of multiple injury among these two ancient Nubian skeletal samples reflected the profile of injury recidivism observed by modern clinicians cross-culturally.

AB  - Purpose Minimally invasive procedures, such as microwave ablation, are becoming first-line treatment options for early-stage liver cancer due to lower complication rates and shorter recovery times than conventional surgical techniques. Although these procedures are promising, one reason preventing widespread adoption is inadequate local tumor ablation leading to observations of higher local cancer recurrence compared to conventional procedures. Poor ablation coverage has been associated with two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) guidance of the therapy needle applicators and has stimulated investigation into the use of three-dimensional (3D) US imaging for these procedures. We have developed a supervised 3D US needle applicator segmentation algorithm using a single user input to augment the addition of 3D US to the current focal liver tumor ablation workflow with the goals of identifying and improving needle applicator localization efficiency. Methods The algorithm is initialized by creating a spherical search space of line segments around a manually chosen seed point that is selected by a user on the needle applicator visualized in a 3D US image. The most probable trajectory is chosen by maximizing the count and intensity of threshold voxels along a line segment and is filtered using the Otsu method to determine the tip location. Homogeneous tissue mimicking phantom images containing needle applicators were used to optimize the parameters of the algorithm prior to a four-user investigation on retrospective 3D US images of patients who underwent microwave ablation for liver cancer. Trajectory, axis localization, and tip errors were computed based on comparisons to manual segmentations in 3D US images. Results Segmentation of needle applicators in ten phantom 3D US images was optimized to median (Q1, Q3) trajectory, axis, and tip errors of 2.1 (1.1, 3.6)°, 1.3 (0.8, 2.1) mm, and 1.3 (0.7, 2.5) mm, respectively, with a mean ± SD segmentation computation time of 0.246 ± 0.007 s. Use of the segmentation method with a 16 in vivo 3D US patient dataset resulted in median (Q1, Q3) trajectory, axis, and tip errors of 4.5 (2.4, 5.2)°, 1.9 (1.7, 2.1) mm, and 5.1 (2.2, 5.9) mm based on all users. Conclusions Segmentation of needle applicators in 3D US images during minimally invasive liver cancer therapeutic procedures could provide a utility that enables enhanced needle applicator guidance, placement verification, and improved clinical workflow. A semi-automated 3D US needle applicator segmentation algorithm used in vivo demonstrated localization of the visualized trajectory and tip with less than 5° and 5.2 mm errors, respectively, in less than 0.31 s. This offers the ability to assess and adjust needle applicator placements intraoperatively to potentially decrease the observed liver cancer recurrence rates associated with current ablation procedures. Although optimized for deep and oblique angle needle applicator insertions, this proposed workflow has the potential to be altered for a variety of image-guided minimally invasive procedures to improve localization and verification of therapy needle applicators intraoperatively.

AB  - Background Although radiation therapy (RT) contributes to survival benefit in many brain tumor patients, it has also been associated with long-term brain injury. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) represent an important manifestation of radiation-related injury. Purpose To characterize the change in size and number of CMBs over time and to evaluate their relationship to white matter structural integrity as measured using diffusion MRI indices. Study Type Longitudinal, retrospective, human cohort. Population In all, 113 brain tumor patients including patients treated with focal RT (n = 91, 80.5%) and a subset of nonirradiated controls (n = 22, 19.5%). Field Strength/Sequence Single and multiecho susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and multiband, shell, and direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 7 T. Assessment Patients were scanned either once or serially. CMBs were detected and quantified on SWI images using a semiautomated approach. Local and global fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured from DTI data for a subset of 35 patients. Statistical Tests Potential risk factors for CMB development were determined by multivariate linear regression and using linear mixed-effect models. Longitudinal FA was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated for trends. Results All patients scanned at 1 or more years post-RT had CMBs. A history of multiple surgical resections was a risk factor for development of CMBs. The total number and volume of CMBs increased by 18% and 11% per year, respectively, although individual CMBs decreased in volume over time. Simultaneous to these microvascular changes, FA decreased by a median of 6.5% per year. While the majority of nonirradiated controls had no CMBs, four control patients presented with fewer than five CMBs. Data Conclusion Identifying patients who are at the greatest risk for CMB development, with its likely associated long-term cognitive impairment, is an important step towards developing and piloting preventative and/or rehabilitative measures for patients undergoing RT.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Mental imagery may occur in any sensory modality, although visual imagery has been most studied. A sensitive measure of the vividness of imagery across a range of modalities is needed: the shorter version of Bett's Questionnaire upon Mental Imagery (Sheehan, , J. Clin. Psychology, 23, 386) uses outdated items and has an unreliable factor structure. We report the development and initial validation of the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (Psi-Q) comprising items for each of the following modalities: Vision, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Bodily Sensation, and Emotional Feeling. An exploratory factor analysis on a 35-item form indicated that these modalities formed separate factors, rather than a single imagery factor, and this was replicated by confirmatory factor analysis. The Psi-Q was validated against the Spontaneous Use of Imagery Scale (Reisberg et al., , Appl. Cogn. Psychology, 17, 147) and Marks' (, J. Mental Imagery, 19, 153) Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VVIQ-2). A short 21-item form comprising the best three items from the seven factors correlated with the total score and subscales of the full form, and with the VVIQ-2. Inspection of the data shows that while visual and sound imagery is most often rated as vivid, individuals who rate one modality as strong and the other as weak are not uncommon. Findings are interpreted within a working memory framework and point to the need for further research to identify the specific cognitive processes underlying the vividness of imagery across sensory modalities.

AB  - Summary Congenital malformations of the lumbosacral spine include spinal dysraphism and caudal anomalies. Most often, these malformations are discovered prenatally or in early infancy, but some are not diagnosed until late childhood or adulthood. The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate the multi-modality imaging characteristics in these complex anomalies and to provide a systematic radiological approach aiming at improving diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Aim:? The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) show differential activation during an emotional activation task compared with age- and sex-matched controls, by measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated (oxyHb) and deoxygenated (deoxyHb) hemoglobin, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods:? Fourteen patients with PDD and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The relative changes of concentrations of oxyHb and deoxyHb were measured on NIRS during an implicit processing task of fearful expression using Japanese standard faces. Results:? PDD patients had significantly reduced oxyHb changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to healthy controls. Conclusion:? PFC dysfunction may exist in PDD.
