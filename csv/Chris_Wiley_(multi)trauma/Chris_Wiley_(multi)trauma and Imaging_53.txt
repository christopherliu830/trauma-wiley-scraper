AB  - Abstract Identifying the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a critical step toward reducing its debilitating impact. Spontaneous neural activity, measured at rest using various neuroimaging techniques (e.g., regional homogeneity [ReHo], amplitude of low frequency fluctuations [ALFF]), can provide insight about baseline neurobiological factors influencing sensory, cognitive, or behavioral processes associated with PTSD. The present study used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct the largest-to-date quantitative meta-analysis of spontaneous neural activity in PTSD, including 457 PTSD cases, 292 trauma-exposed controls (TECs), and 293 non-traumatized controls (NTCs) across 22 published studies. Five regions-of-interest (ROIs) were identified where activity differed between PTSD cases and controls: one when compared to all controls (left globus pallidus), two when compared to TECs (left inferior parietal lobule [IPL] and right lingual gyrus), and two when compared to NTCs (left amygdala and right caudate head). To corroborate these results, a second analysis was conducted using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on an independent sample of 205 previously-deployed US military veterans. In this analysis, converging evidence from ReHo and ALFF showed that spontaneous neural activity in the left IPL alone was positively correlated with PTSD symptom severity. This result is consistent with theoretical accounts that link left IPL activity with PTSD-relevant processes such as processing of emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) and the extent that attention is captured by salient autobiographical memories. By modeling the neurobiological correlates of PTSD, we can increase our understanding of this debilitating disorder and guide the development of future clinical innovations.

AB  - A ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality encountered in infants and children. Many of them survive through adulthood before diagnosis. Two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. In the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. In this report, we discuss a multi?imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.

PTSD may be the commonest anxiety disorder in ED but it seems to be independent from ED. Clinicians should be aware that PTSD might represent more than just an occasional occurrence in ED clinical work and should know how to approach it.

The course taught participants to apply collaborative and contextually sensitive approaches to enhance social connectedness and resilience in families, communities, and organizations. This article presents core training principles and vignettes which illustrate how those engaging in such interventions must: (1) work in the context of a strong and supportive organization; (2) appreciate the complexity of the systems with which they are engaging; and (3) be open to the possibilities for healing and transformation. The program utilized a combination of didactic presentations, hands-on interactive exercises, case studies, and experiential approaches to organizational team building and staff stress management.

AB  - ABSTRACT A novel method to automatically compute the symmetry plane and to correct the 3D orientation of neuro-images is presented. In acquisition of neuroimaging scans, the lack of perfect alignment of a patient's head makes it challenging to evaluate brain images. By deploying a shape-based criterion, the symmetry plane is defined as a plane that best matches external surface points on one side of the head, with their counterparts on the other side. In our method, the head volume is represented as a re-parameterized surface point cloud, where each location is parameterized by its elevation (latitude), azimuth (longitude), and radius. The search for the best matching surfaces is implemented in a multi-resolution paradigm, and the computation time is significantly decreased. The algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using in both simulated data and in real T1, T2, Flair magnetic resonance patient images. This algorithm is found to be fast (<10s per MR volume), robust and accurate (<.6 degree of Mean Angular Error), invariant to the acquisition noise, slice thickness, bias field, and pathological asymmetries.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.

AB  - The effect of the chemical shift artifact, resulting from misregistration or phase cancellation at the interface between compact and trabecular bone, on apparent bone thickness was quantified in six isolated equine limbs. Sagittal T1-weighted spin echo (SE) and in-phase three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) images were acquired twice with a 1.5?T magnetic resonance (MR) unit, switching the frequency encoding direction between acquisitions. Out-of-phase SPGR images were also obtained. MR images with different frequency encoding directions were compared with each other and to radiographs made from corresponding 3-mm-bone sections. Compact bone thickness was significantly different when comparing images acquired with different frequency encoding directions for both SE and SPGR sequences. Significant differences were identified in the frequency but not the phase encoding direction when measurements of compact bone in MR images were compared with measurements obtained from thin section radiographs for the majority of surfaces studied (P<0.05). Correction of MR measurements with the calculated chemical shift abolished these differences (P>0.05). Measurements of compact bone from out-of-phase SPGR sequences were significantly different than from in-phase sequences (P<0.001) with out-of-phase measurements greater than in-phase measurements by an average of 0.38?mm. These results indicate that the chemical shift artifact results in errors in MR evaluation of compact bone thickness when measurements are performed in the frequency encoding direction or in out-of-phase images. For better accuracy, measurements should be performed parallel to the phase encoding direction and avoiding out-of-phase gradient echo sequences.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Volumetric muscle loss (VML) occurs following significant traumatic injury or surgical removal of skeletal muscle, resulting in nonrecoverable loss of tissue and long-term dysfunction. Perhaps less recognized is that VML injuries inherently disrupt the neuromuscular unit, resulting in fiber denervation and presumptive motor unit rearrangement, expansion, and/or loss. To characterize neural dysfunction we quantified motoneuron axotomy, in efforts to understand how this relates to the temporal coordination of neuromuscular and morphological alterations due to injury. Methods In an established rat tibialis anterior (TA) VML injury model, we examined the motoneuron, skeletal muscle, and maximal isometric torque at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days postinjury. Results Significant axotomy of 57?79% of all TA muscle motoneurons was observed through 21 days postinjury, which was coupled with a 45?90% TA maximal torque deficit. Discussion A ?20% partial ablation of the TA muscle causes disproportionate damage across the motor unit acutely postinjury. Muscle Nerve 57: 799?807, 2018

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury causes post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). About ?50% of patients rupturing their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) will develop PTOA within 1?2 decades of the injury, yet the mechanisms responsible for the development of PTOA after joint injury are not well understood. In this study, we examined whole joint gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) at 1 day, 1-, 6-, and 12 weeks post injury, in a non-invasive tibial compression (TC) overload mouse model of PTOA that mimics ACL rupture in humans. We identified 1446 genes differentially regulated between injured and contralateral joints. This includes known regulators of osteoarthritis such as MMP3, FN1, and COMP, and several new genes including Suco, Sorcs2, and Medag. We also identified 18 long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the injured joints. By comparing our data to gene expression data generated using the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) PTOA model, we identified several common genes and shared mechanisms. Our study highlights several differences between these two models and suggests that the TC model may be a more rapidly progressing model of PTOA. This study provides the first account of gene expression changes associated with PTOA development and progression in a TC model. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract The most important service that imaging provides to patients with ischemic stroke is to rapidly identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from immediate treatment. This group includes patients who have severe neurological symptoms due to an occlusion of a major artery, and who are candidates for recanalization using intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial intervention to remove the occlusion. Outcomes for these patients are determined by symptom severity, the artery that is occluded, the size of the infarct at the time of presentation, and the effect of treatment. MRI provides key physiological information through MR angiography and diffusion MRI that has been proven to be of high clinical value in identify patients who are in need of immediate treatment. Perfusion MRI provides information about the ischemic penumbra, but its clinical value is unproven. In current clinical practice, the time since stroke onset is dominant over physiologic information provided by MRI in treatment decisions. This will change only when clinical trials prove that stroke physiology as revealed by MRI is superior to time from stroke onset in promoting good clinical outcomes. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Introduction We report a series of patients who had computed tomography (CT) of their brains which showed an uncommon artefact caused by excess air bubbles in the cooling oil around the X-ray tube. Methods In November and December 2015, it was recognised that artefacts appearing on CT brain images acquired at our department were caused by a scanner fault. The test images were reviewed and the service engineer for the CT scanner was questioned about the artefact cause. A retrospective audit was then performed of images acquired on the CT scanner from December 2015 back to the date that the CT scanner was last serviced in September 2015 to identify any other scans affected by the artefact. Results Seven patients were identified whose CT brain scans showed the artefact. The artefact manifested in the form of an ill-defined low density area in varying locations. The artefact also appeared on CT phantom test images. It was discovered to be caused by the presence of excess air bubbles within the cooling oil of the X-ray tube. The fault was then rectified. Conclusions The artefact described may not be easily recognised and could lead to misinterpretation and unnecessary investigation. We aim to promote awareness of this artefact and to reinforce the importance of frequent quality control testing of CT systems.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in damage to the developing brain, particularly in severely injured individuals. Little is known, however, of the long-term structural aspects of the brain following childhood TBI. This study investigated the integrity of the brain 10 years post-TBI using magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics in a sample of 49 participants with mild, moderate and severe TBI, evaluated against a normative sample of 20 individuals from a pediatric database with comparable age and gender distribution. Structural integrity was investigated in gray and white matter, and by manually segmenting two regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala), potentially vulnerable to the effects of childhood TBI. The results indicate that more severe injuries caused a reduction in gray and white brain matter, while all TBI severity levels resulted in increased volumes of cerebrospinal fluid and smaller hippocampal volumes. In addition, enlarged amygdala volumes were detected in severely injured patients compared to their mild and moderate counterparts, suggesting that childhood TBI may disrupt the development of certain brain regions through diffuse pathological changes. The findings highlight the lasting impact of childhood TBI on the brain and the importance of monitoring brain structure in the long-term after early injury.

AB  - Abstract A patient with a medial and posterior dislocation of the right sterno-clavicular (SC) joint and displacement of the trachea and brachiocephalic artery by the medial head of the clavicle underwent general anaesthetic in the operating theatre for an open reduction procedure. The surgeon initially attempted a closed reduction, but this required imaging to check SC alignment. The patient was transferred to an adjacent hybrid operating theatre for imaging. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed, which successfully demonstrated a significant reduction in the dislocation of the SC joint. The trachea and brachiocephalic artery were no longer compressed or displaced. This case study demonstrates an alternative to the patient being transferred to the medical imaging department for multi-slice CT. It also describes a novel use of the hybrid operating theatre and its CBCT capabilities.

AB  - Abstract MRI has contributed to significant advances in the understanding of neurological diseases in humans. It has also been used to evaluate the spectrum of mouse models spanning from developmental abnormalities during embryogenesis, evaluation of transgenic and knockout models, through various neurological diseases such as stroke, tumors, degenerative and inflammatory diseases. The MRI techniques used clinically are technically more challenging in the mouse because of the size of the brain; however, mouse imaging provides researchers with the ability to explore cellular and molecular imaging that one day may translate into clinical practice. This article presents an overview of the use of MRI in mouse models of a variety of neurological disorders and a brief review of cellular imaging using magnetically tagged cells in the mouse central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients with comorbid panic disorder (PD) may express additive symptoms of central fear system disturbance. They endorse elevated levels of sleep and nightmare disturbance [Leskin GA, et al., J Psychiatr Res 2002;36:449?452], and demonstrate movement suppression during laboratory sleep [Woodward SH, et al., Sleep 2002;25:681?688]. We estimated respiratory rate and rate variability separately for rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep. Subjects were 49 Vietnam combat-related PTSD inpatients (11 with comorbid PD and 38 without) and 15 controls. Computer-based estimates of respiratory rate and variability were derived from 10 to 18 hr of baseline sleep collected over two or three nights. Neither rate nor rate variability distinguished PTSD patients with comorbid PD from those without, or PTSD patients from controls; however, PTSD patients failed to exhibit the expected differences between REM and NREM respiratory rates. Moreover, the difference between REM and NREM respiratory rate was inversely related to a continuous measure of PTSD severity. PTSD patients with trauma-related nightmare complaint exhibited higher sleep respiration rates over both REM and NREM sleep. Conversely, in addition to slowed respiration, nightmare-free patients exhibited reduced respiratory rate variability in REM relative to NREM sleep, which was a reversal of the normal pattern. These finding are discussed in light of known telencephalic regulatory influences upon respiration rate. Depression and Anxiety 18:198?204, 2003 ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To evaluate multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in hanging and manual strangulation cases and compare them with forensic autopsy results. Materials and Methods Postmortem MSCT and MRI of nine persons who died from hanging or manual strangulation were performed. The neck findings were compared with those discovered during forensic autopsy. In addition, two living patients underwent imaging and clinical examination following severe manual strangulation and near-hanging, respectively. For evaluation, the findings were divided into ?primary? (strangulation mark and subcutaneous desiccation (i.e., soft-tissue thinning as a result of tissue fluids being driven out by mechanical compression) in hanging, and subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhage in manual strangulation) and ?collateral? signs. The Wilcoxon two-tailed test was used for statistical analysis of the lymph node and salivary gland findings. Results In hanging, the primary and most frequent collateral signs were revealed by imaging. In manual strangulation, the primary findings were accurately depicted, with the exception of one slight hemorrhage. Apart from a vocal cord hemorrhage, all frequent collateral signs could be diagnosed radiologically. Traumatic lymph node hemorrhage (P = 0.031) was found in all of the manual strangulation cases. Conclusion MSCT and MRI revealed strangulation signs concordantly with forensic pathology findings. Imaging offers a great potential for the forensic examination of lesions due to strangulation in both clinical and postmortem settings. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Three hundred and thirty-nine Vietnam combat veterans with the diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder were administered the Vietnam Related Experiences Questionnaire. The items on this questionnaire were constructed to highlight four combat related conflicts postulated to represent the salient symptom clusters within PTSD: fear-anxiety, mistrust, survival guilt, and guilt secondary to aggression. Exploratory factor analysis followed by a confirmatory factor analytic procedure using maximum likelihood estimate demonstrated a five-factor solution: vulnerability, guilt, dreams of death/destruction, depression, and rebelliousness. The factor loadings of the variables and the factor correlations are discussed. Diagnostic features of the questionnaire are highlighted.

AB  - Summary Nuclear Medicine. The first critical component of a NM study is a radiopharmaceutical, comprising a pharmacologic agent that is taken up preferentially by some organ or other biologic compartment of interest coupled to a radioactive material that produces photons (gamma-rays or 511 keV annihilation photons); the second is a device such as a gamma or PET camera to image these high-energy photons emerging from the body. The chapter begins with a discussion of aspects of gamma- and positron-emitting radionuclides, which leads into description of NM image receptors. It proceeds with detailed examples of some common static and dynamic planar clinical studies, followed by three-dimensional SPECT and PET imaging, including EKG-gated examination of the cardiac cycle. The chapter concludes with internal-dose assessment, and with image quality assurance and radiation safety programs.

AB  - In the aftermath of a disaster like Hurricane Katrina, remote-sensing methods are often employed in an effort to assess damage. However, their utility may be limited by the aerial perspective and image resolution. The Spatial Video Acquisition System (SVAS), in conjunction with a Geographic Information System (GIS), has the potential to be a complementary methodology for obtaining damage assessment information as well as capturing recovery related geographies associated with post-traumatic stress. An example is provided from the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans with data that could be used to predict neighborhood post-traumatic stress. Results reveal six dimensions in which a SVAS can improve existing disaster-related data collection approaches: organization, archiving, transferability, evaluation, objectivity, and feasibility.
