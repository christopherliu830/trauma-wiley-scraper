AB  - Summary Midcarpal instability syndrome is often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed recognition, treatment and possibly poor clinical outcome. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) has previously proved useful in assessment of the acromioclavicular joint and wrist motion, allowing clinicians and radiologists to gain an understanding of abnormalities in function as well as morphology, which often contribute to patient symptoms. We present the case of a 25-year-old male with no history of trauma who presents with several months of a right wrist clunk on both passive and active (load bearing) motion. Plain film and 1.5 Tesla MRI with intra-articular contrast demonstrates a normal appearance, without joint space, tendon or ligament disturbance. We further investigated this condition using a wide volume detector CT scanning technique (4D CT). Data from the patient's asymptomatic wrist was utilized as a comparison for this study. Assessment of cine movie files from the symptomatic wrist revealed abnormal subluxation of the capitate from the lunate when compared with the normal wrist, in which the capitate did not deviate from the concavity of the lunate and did not cross the perpendicular line from the superior pole of the lunate in any phase of motion, which we defined as capitate subluxation. 4D CT allows for detection of capitate subluxation in an earlier stage of disease progression, constituting earlier recognition and providing the opportunity for earlier treatment of the disease, potentially mitigating significant patient morbidity. We have been able to confidently identify capitate subluxation both visually (assessment of the sagittal RLC axis) and objectively (documentation of percent subluxation of the capitate beyond the superior pole of the lunate). We propose that 4D CT investigation of all functional carpal instability syndromes may be beneficial as this technique has the potential to significantly increase our knowledge of dynamic carpal bone abnormalities.

AB  - Abstract Bill Clinton's willingness to engage with popular culture, such as appearing on MTV, reinforced the claim he made that as a New Democrat he represented something new ideologically. With his 1963 meeting with John Kennedy, his admiration for Martin Luther King, and his association with (and controversial opposition to) the Vietnam War, he became a symbol of the 1960s. He was described as the first black president in terms of what he represented culturally and was strongly identified with the feminist agenda. His regional identification with the South was another ingredient in his image. Overall his image created a sense of Clinton as something new in American politics and this was a crucial ingredient in his political success.

AB  - Summary Vascular anomalies encompass a broad spectrum of tumours and malformations as classified by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. Despite being one of the most common congenital abnormalities, they are often misunderstood in clinical practice: use of the term ?haemangioma? to denote any vascular anomaly still occurs. They are found frequently in the head and neck, often as complex lesions that require multidisciplinary management which necessitates an accurate diagnosis. Precise radiological assessment is therefore crucial. This pictorial review will briefly discuss the current classification system of vascular anomalies and the optimal radiological tools for their evaluation.

AB  - Abstract Introduction A Radiographer Abnormality Detection System (RADS), such as the ?red dot system?, involves radiographers highlighting the presence of potential acute abnormalities on radiographs in the emergency setting. The literature suggests little additional training is required of radiographers to participate in such a system, posing little impact on current workflow while remaining a cost-effective, easy-to-implement program. However, its use outside the United Kingdom is sporadic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of use of a RADS in Queensland public hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was developed and distributed to 28 medical imaging department directors throughout metropolitan, rural and remote Queensland (Australia) public hospitals. The results of this survey were analysed using conventional descriptive statistics of response frequencies and the percentage of the sample. Results The questionnaire was completed by 25 radiography directors (89% response rate). Sixteen percent of respondents, all metropolitan-based, indicated a RADS was in operation (n = 4/25; 16%). Respondents without a RADS (n = 21/21; 100%) expressed interest in a trial. Just over half (n = 13/25; 52%) of the respondents believed their staff members were not trained appropriately to implement a RADS successfully. Conclusion This study found an infrequent use of RADSs in Queensland public hospitals. This finding presents a unique opportunity for medical imaging professionals to enhance communication between the facets of a multidisciplinary emergency team via the implementation of RADS complemented by a radiographer commenting system.

J Clin Periodontol 2010; 37: 398?403. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01535.x Abstract Aim: To assess the accuracy of implants placed flapless by a stereolithographic template in partially edentulous patients. Material and Methods: Eight patients, requiring two to four implants (maxilla or mandible), were consecutively recruited. Radiographical data were obtained by means of a cone beam or a multi-slice CT scan and imported in a software program. Implants (n=21) were planned in a virtual environment, leading to the manufacture of one stereolithographic template per patient to guide the implant placement in a one-stage flapless procedure. A postoperative cone beam CT was performed to calculate the difference between virtual implant (n=21) positions in the preoperative planning and postoperative situation. Results: A mean angular deviation of 2.7° (range 0.4?8, SD 1.9), with a mean deviation at the apex of 1.0?mm (range 0.2?3.0, SD 0.7), was observed. If one patient, a dropout because of non-conformity with the protocol, was excluded, the angular deviation was reduced to 2.2° (range 0.6?3.9, SD 1.1), and the apical deviation to 0.9?mm (range 0.2?1.8). Conclusion: Based on this limited patient population, a flapless implant installation appears to be a useful procedure even when based on accurate and reliable 3D CT-based image data and a dedicated implant planning software.

AB  - Objective To compare postoperative CT images with plain radiographs for measuring prognostic factors of reduction loss of fractures of the proximal part of the humerus. Methods A total of 65 patients who sustained fractures of the proximal humerus treated with locking plates from June 2012 to October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 men and 41 women, with a mean age of 60.0 years (range, 22?76 years). According to the Neer classification system of proximal humeral fracture, there were 26 two-part, 27 three-part and 12 four-part fractures of the proximal part of the humerus, and all fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using locked plating. All postoperative CT images and plain radiographs of the patients were obtained. Prognostic factors of the reduction loss were the change of neck shaft angle (NSA) and the change of humeral head height (HHH). The change of NSA and HHH were evaluated by the difference between postoperative initial and final follow-up measurement. Reduction loss was defined as the change ≥10° for NSA or ≥5 mm for HHH. The NSA and HHH were measured using plain radiographs and 3-D CT images, both initially and at final follow-up. The paired t-test was used for comparison of NSA, change of NSA, HHH, and change of HHH between two image modalities. The differences between two image modalities in the assessment of reduction loss were examined using the ?2-test (McNemar test). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer reliability. Results 3-D CT images (ICC range, 0.834?0.967) were more reliable in all parameters when compared with plain radiographs (ICC range, 0.598?0.915). Significant differences were found between the two image modalities in all parameters (plain radiographs: initial NSA = 133.6° ± 3.8°, final NSA = 130.0° ± 1.9°, initial HHH = 17.9 ± 0.9 mm, final HHH = 15.8 ± 1.5 mm; 3-D CT: initial NSA = 131.4° ± 3.4°, final NSA = 128.8° ± 1.7°, initial HHH = 16.8 ± 1.2 mm, final HHH = 14.5 ± 1.1 mm; all P < 0.05). In the assessment of reduction loss, the percentage was 16.9% (11/65) for the plain radiographs and 7.7% (5/65) for the 3-D CT scans (P < 0.05). For the 5 patients with reduction loss, which were observed by two imaging modalities, the mean Constant?Murley score was 61.0 ± 1.6. The patients with reduction loss, observed only in plain radiographs but not CT images, had good shoulder function (Constant?Murley score: 82.7 ± 1.0). Conclusions Our data reveal that 3-D CT images are more reliable than plain radiographs in the assessment of the prognostic factors of reduction loss of fractures of the proximal part of the humerus with treatment of locking plates; this reliable CT technique can serve as an effective guideline for the subsequent clinical management of patients.

AB  - In general, Irritant skin reactions are graded by using visual scoring method for the degree of erythema, edema and scaling. The main disadvantage of this method lacks objectivity and parametric properties. The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative evaluation method by using computerized color image analysis of skin erythema. We have described the objective measurement of the irritant skin responses by using skin surface color determination and compared it with the measurement by using traditional visual scoring method. Using R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue) value and CIE color parameters (L*a*b*) of digital camera image by using the software program, two kind of erythema index (?RG, ?ab) and change in total color (?E*ab) were calculated. ?RG value and ?ab in digital camera image were highly correlated with the degree of erythema than chromameter measurements. And ?ab (difference in color redness (a*) and yellow hue (b*)) with the exception of luminance (L* value) in CIE was well correlated than change in total color (?E*ab). Our data showed that erythema indices (?RG, ?ab) were good parameters for evaluation of skin erythema produced by irritant reaction.

AB  - Background:? Cerebral perfusion-CT (PCT) is commonly used to image patients with suspected stroke, but PCT may also be useful in detecting abnormalities following seizure. Methods:? We retrospectively identified patients who presented to our stroke center between 2000 and 2008 with acute, transient neurological deficits because of seizure and received PCT imaging within 72?h. We compared the group of seizure patients with abnormal post-ictal PCT to a group of seizure patients with normal post-ictal PCT. Patients were excluded from analysis if the seizure occurred secondary to an acute process known to alter cerebral perfusion. Results:? Of 27 patients with acute post-ictal neurological deficits, PCT was abnormal in 10 (37%) and normal in 17 (63%). The most common post-ictal perfusion abnormality, seen in eight of 10 patients, was focal hypoperfusion, with prolonged mean transit time (MTT) and decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, in a cortical ribbon pattern, multi-lobar or holo-hemispheric distribution, sparing the basal ganglia. CT Angiography (CTA) showed no corresponding large vessel pathology. Two other PCT abnormalities ? focal hyperperfusion and an isolated prolonged MTT ? were also observed in single patients. Imaging within 2?h after seizure termination was significantly associated with finding a post-ictal PCT abnormality (P?<?0.039). Conclusions:? Post-ictal cerebral PCT abnormalities are relatively common in patients early after seizure. When PCT abnormalities occur in atypical vascular distributions ? and the CTA shows no corresponding large vessel occlusions ? seizure should be considered as a diagnostic possibility prior to giving acute stroke therapy.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after kidney transplantation is 15-fold increased. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is one of the known risk factors. We performed a small pilot study to assess the role of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for intensified screening in renal transplant recipients with ACKD. Renal ultrasound was used to assess the native kidneys of 215 renal transplant recipients. Thirty patients with 54 kidneys, fulfilling the criteria of ACKD, underwent non-enhanced MRI at 1.5T using T2- and T1-weighed as well as diffusion-weighted sequences with a high spatial resolution. Among the 54 kidneys assessed by both methods, three RCCs were identified (6%). Of those, one RCC was detected by both imaging methods (33%), while two RCCs were diagnosed by MRI alone (67%). MRI identified an additional four proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts that did not fulfill the criteria for RCC but were classified as suspicious. All of these lesions were stable in size and appearance in follow-up studies. In conclusion, non-enhanced MRI was more sensitive than ultrasound in identifying RCCs and lesions suspicious for RCC and thus appears to be a useful secondary screening tool in patients with ACKD after renal transplantation.

Methods Data on 300 patients presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis were retrospectively collected and ultrasonographic images were assessed for defined structural changes. The incidence of major complications was determined. Multi-variable multi-level logistic regression was used to investigate the association of ultrasonographic findings with positive bile culture. Results Three hundred percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis procedures performed in 201 dogs and 51 cats were included; 35 patients had the procedure performed more than once. The overall incidence of major complications was 8 of 300 procedures (2·7%). Bile peritonitis occurred in 2 of 300 procedures (0·7%). An ultrasonographically abnormal gall bladder was found in 52% of cases and had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 82, 55·7 and 61·5% respectively, to predict a positive bile culture. Clinical Significance Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is overall a safe technique when carried out in selected patients. Abnormal ultrasonographic findings are only a fair predictor of a positive bile culture.

AB  - Summary We have applied high-quality medical imaging techniques to study the structure of the human ankle. Direct volume rendering, using specific algorithms, transforms conventional two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance image (MRI) series into 3D volume datasets. This tool allows high-definition visualization of single or multiple structures for diagnostic, research, and teaching purposes. No other image reformatting technique so accurately highlights each anatomic relationship and preserves soft tissue definition. Here, we used this method to study the structure of the human ankle to analyze tendon?bone?muscle relationships. We compared ankle MRI and computerized tomography (CT) images from 17 healthy volunteers, aged 18?30?years (mean 23?years). An additional subject had a partial rupture of the Achilles tendon. The MRI images demonstrated superiority in overall quality of detail compared to the CT images. The MRI series accurately rendered soft tissue and bone in simultaneous image acquisition, whereas CT required several window-reformatting algorithms, with loss of image data quality. We obtained high-quality digital images of the human ankle that were sufficiently accurate for surgical and clinical intervention planning, as well as for teaching human anatomy. Our approach demonstrates that complex anatomical structures such as the ankle, which is rich in articular facets and ligaments, can be easily studied non-invasively using MRI data.

AB  - In this study, mapping of ultrashort T2 and T2* of acutely isolated porcine menisci at B0?=?9.4?T was investigated. Maps of T2 were measured from a slice through the pars intermedia with a spin echo-prepared two-dimensional ultrashort-TE T2 mapping technique published previously. T2* mapping was performed by two-dimensional ultrashort-TE MRI with variable acquisition delay. The measured signal decays were fitted by monoexponential, biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fitting functions. The occurrence of Gaussian-like signal decays is outlined theoretically. The quality of the curve fits was visualized by mapping the value δ = abs(1 ? ?2red). For T2* mapping, the Gaussian-exponential fit showed the best performance, whereas the monoexponential and biexponential fits showed regionally high values of δ (δ > 20). Interpretation of the Gaussian-exponential parameter maps was found to be difficult, because a Gaussian signal component can be related to mesoscopic (collagen texture) or macroscopic (slice profile, shim, sample geometry) magnetic field inhomogeneities and/or residual 1H dipole?dipole couplings. It seems likely that an interplay of these effects yielded the observed signal decays. Modulation of the T2* signal decay caused by chemical shift was observed and addressed to fat protons by means of histology. In the T2 measurements, no modulation of the signal decay was observed and the biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fits showed the best performance with comparable values of δ. Our results suggest that T2 mapping provides the more robust method for the characterization of meniscal tissue by means of MRI relaxometry. However, mapping of ultrashort T2, as performed in this study, is time consuming and provides less signal-to-noise ratio per time than the mapping of T2*. If T2* mapping is used, pixel-wise monitoring of the fitting quality based on reduced ?2 should be employed and great care should be taken when interpreting the parameter maps of the fits.

AB  - Summary The principal advantages of electronic radiography that have emerged in the course of early clinical experience may be summarised as follows: 1. Instantaneous availability of images for immediate and unhurried examination. 2. Greatly reduced radiation doses to patient and staff per recorded image. Reduced radiation exposure for given resolution and contrast required. Greater freedom to use x-ray examinations in pregnancy. 3. Increased spatial detail relative to standard spot-films and normal fluoroscopy. 4. Instantaneous production of arterial maps for selective catheterisation and interventional procedures. 5. Precise positioning of catheters and needles through the combination of live and stored reference images. 6. Reduced time for special procedures; reduced patient trauma; more efficient use of die radiologist's time. 7. Reduction in the total amount of contrast material needed in selective catheterisation, with reduction in the risk of contrast effects. 8. Replacement of life-sized images by smaller images, with reduction in film, display, filing and retrieval costs. Abstract New television techniques in diagnostic radiology have been developed as a result of the availability of high resolution imaging components. These electronic radiographic techniques record images with higher image quality than conventional films but with much less radiation dose to the patient and personnel. These methods are being developed for pelvimetry, intrauterine transfusion, gastrointestinal examinations, stereotaxic procedures, and selective catheterisation. Reduction in examination time, dosage of contrast media, and patient trauma can be effected, training can be facilitated, and substantial economies achieved.

AB  - Abstract Knee injuries are a common presentation to the ED and are often difficult to assess and definitively diagnose due to the patient's acute pain, effusion and guarding. The quality of ED care provided to patients with fractures or soft tissue injuries of the knee is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common knee injuries in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2250 articles, of which 54 were included in the review (n?=?8 primary articles, n?=?28 systematic reviews, n?=?18 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the knee in the ED, a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is consistent evidence to support undertaking a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of special tests and clinical decision rules for imaging. In the undifferentiated knee injury, expedited follow up and further imaging is recommended to improve patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract There is growing evidence of the brain's ability to increase its reliance on alternative metabolic substrates under conditions of energy stress such as starvation, hypoxia and ischemia. We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate ?-hydroxybutyrate (?HB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of ?HB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-?HB 3?h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available ?HB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial ?HB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3?h of ?HB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h ?HB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham ?HB-infused animals. The TBI-induced 20% decrease in ipsilateral cortical ATP concentration was alleviated by 3?h of ?HB infusion beginning immediately after CCI injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective Dental implant placement in scapular free flaps is challenging. This study examines the scapula with computed tomography to identify ideal locations for predictable implant placement during preoperative planning. Methods Sixty-eight adult patient chest CT scans (34 men, 34 women) captured for various medical indications, were analyzed for age, height, weight, and scapula length. The lateral border of the scapula was divided into six equal segments; the midpoints of each segment (labeled proximally to distally as 1M?6M) were analyzed in cross-section as potential recipient sites for 3.5???8?mm implants. Also, we present a case of a 77-year-old male with ameloblastoma of the mandible who underwent patient specific planning and received a scapular free flap with dental implant placement. Results There was greater bone availability in males with a mean depth of 8.3?±?2.8 versus 5.1?±?3.3 mm in females (p?<?.01). The proximal portion (1M) of the scapula in males and females had depths of 11.3?±?1.5 and 9.5?±?2.3 mm, respectively. Males had depths of 8.4?±?3.0 in M3, 9.7?±?1.7 in M4, and 8.9?±?1.2 mm in M6. Depth of bone available for patients with heights ≥165?cm versus <165?cm had means of 10.4?±?1.3 and 8.0?±?1.6 mm (p?<?.01), respectively; but showed no significant differences between BMI (BMI <25 vs. ≥25) and bone availability (6.8?±?1.7 vs. 6.8?±?1.6, p?=?.07), or age (<55?years vs. ≥55?years) and bone availability (9.8?±?1.6 vs. 9.8?±?1.6, p?=?.11). In our case, the patient received 6 cm length of scapular bone with four 4.1???14?mm endosteal implants, which upon osseointegration was able to receive a fixed dental prosthesis. Three years after the initial surgery, the patient has had no difficulty with his prosthesis. Conclusion In females the most proximal portion of the scapula will predictably accommodate a dental implant, while males have multiple sites including the proximal, middle, and distal portions.

AB  - Strangely, anthropologists have ignored popular accounts of themselves. Yet anthropologists are the most popularized academics in fiction. They are portrayed as either heroic or (much more common) pathetic. Fieldwork marks them out as distinctive and makes ordinary anthropologists odd and the already odd ones even odder. Writers of fiction exploit these characters to enable geographical shifts, debate cultural relativity, poke fun at the discipline, discuss anthropological ideas, and detect crimes. Usually, these images of anthropologists are Anglocentric, fundamentally atemporal, gender-blind, and apolitical. Since a good number of these authors are anthropologists themselves, they suggest that some of our colleagues have a frivolous attitude to the discipline. Studying these popular works, which may be regarded as forms of applied anthropology, helps to dislodge the hegemony of its academic version. They remind us that anthropology is not singular, but plural, and that only a section of its history is decided within the cloisters of academe.

AB  - Background Echinococcosis is an uncommonly encountered zoonotic disease caused by the taeniid Echinococcus. The only endemic species in Australia, Echinococcus granulosus, forms cysts in the liver in 70% of cases. The aim of this study was to review the literature to provide an evidence-based narrative update on the diagnosis and management of hepatic cystic echinococcosis in Australia. Methods We reviewed the literature, utilizing multiple research databases and citation tracking. Original research and review articles examining the diagnosis and management of hydatid disease in adults, published prior to 2016 and in the English language were included in our review. Results Ultrasound is the gold-standard screening test, whilst computed tomography has a role in emergency presentations and screening for multi-organ involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred second-line imaging and better demonstrates biliary involvement. Medical therapy or PAIR (percutaneous aspiration, irrigation with scolicide and re-aspiration) may be appropriate in selected cases; however, surgery remains the definitive treatment for active, large (>5 cm), symptomatic or complicated cysts. A variety of surgical techniques have been described, including conservative, radical and minimally invasive procedures. There is currently no consensus approach; surgical modality should be tailored to patient factors, relevant anatomy, local facilities and surgeons? expertise. Conclusion Diagnosis and therapy in hepatic hydatid cysts have been significantly advanced by imaging, interventional radiology and surgical approaches in recent years. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for large, active, complicated or symptomatic hepatic hydatid cysts.
