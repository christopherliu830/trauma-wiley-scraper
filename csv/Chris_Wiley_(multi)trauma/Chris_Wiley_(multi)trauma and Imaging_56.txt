AB  - Abstract Purpose To perform baseline T2 mapping of the hips of healthy volunteers, focusing on topographic variation, because no detailed study has involved hips. T2 mapping is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that evaluates cartilage matrix components. Materials and Methods Hips of 12 healthy adults (six men and six women; mean age = 29.5 ± 4.9 years) were studied with a 3.0-Tesla MRI system. T2 measurement in the oblique-coronal plane used a multi-spin-echo (MSE) sequence. Femoral cartilage was divided into 12 radial sections; acetabular cartilage was divided into six radial sections, and each section was divided into two layers representing the superficial and deep halves of the cartilage. T2 of these sections and layers were measured. Results Femoral cartilage T2 was the shortest (?20° to 20° and ?10° to 10°, superficial and deep layers), with an increase near the magic angle (54.7°). Acetabular cartilage T2 in both layers was shorter in the periphery than the other parts, especially at 20° to 30°. There were no significant differences in T2 between right and left hips or between men and women. Conclusion Topographic variation exists in hip cartilage T2 in young, healthy adults. These findings should be taken into account when T2 mapping is applied to patients with degenerative cartilage. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007;26:165?171. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatized muscle, such as that debrided from blast injury sites, is considered a promising and convenient tissue source for multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs), a population of adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells. The present study aimed to assess the regenerative therapeutic potential of human traumatized muscle-derived MPCs, e.g., for injury repair in the blast-traumatized extremity, by comparing their pro-angiogenic potential in vitro and capillary recruitment activity in vivo to those of MSCs isolated from human bone marrow, a widely-used tissue source. MPCs were tested for their direct and indirect effects on human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. The findings reported here showed that MPC-conditioned culture medium (MPC-CM), like MSC-CM, promoted EC-cord network branching. Silent (si)RNA-mediated silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in MPCs attenuated this effect. In a chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane in vivo angiogenesis assay, MPCs encapsulated in photocrosslinked gelatin scaffold recruited blood vessels more efficiently than either MSCs or human foreskin fibroblasts. Together, these findings support the potential application of traumatized muscle-derived MPCs in cell-based regenerative medicine therapies as a result of their influence on EC organization.

AB  - Abstract Writing from experiences in the consulting room in private practice in Australia, the author refers to the layered complexity of a conflict of ethical duty which has legal and social implications. The paper explores how the ethics that are congruent with creating a safe vas bene claustrum can be diametrically opposed to the social and legal structures and processes on which we all rely. It is suggested that within the vas, analysts and analysands engage in a shared process of emotionally connected, layered, symbolic thinking. Subpoenas directed at analysts are seeking concrete evidence that will stand up in court. The paper argues that this is a category error based on ignorance and misconceptions of what analytic work entails. The intrusion of a subpoena into the vas has the potential to cause havoc in the mental health and the lives of already vulnerable, possibly traumatized and isolated individuals. It can undermine a fundamental human right and undermine the profession of psychotherapy as a whole. The paper proposes that analysts have an ethical obligation to protect the work contained within the vas from these category errors and to educate other professionals as to why we cannot provide the kind of evidence that the courts require.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate adiabatic T1? and T2? of articular cartilage in symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) patients and asymptomatic volunteers, and to determine their association with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based structural abnormalities in cartilage and bone. Materials and Methods A total of 24 subjects (age range: 50?68 years; 12 female) were enrolled, including 12 early OA patients and 12 volunteers with normal joint function. Patients and volunteers underwent 3T MRI. T2, adiabatic T1?, and T2? relaxation times of knee articular cartilage were measured. Proton density (PD)- and T1-weighted MR image series were also obtained and separately evaluated for morphological changes using the MRI OA Knee Scoring (MOAKS) system. Comparisons using the Mann?Whitney nonparametric test were performed after dividing the study participants according to physical symptoms as determined by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score or presence of cartilage lesions, bone marrow lesions, or osteophytes. Results Elevated adiabatic T1? and T2? relaxation times of articular cartilage were associated with cartilage loss (P?=?0.024?0.047), physical symptoms (0.0068?0.035), and osteophytes (0.0039?0.027). Elevated adiabatic T1? was also associated with bone marrow lesions (0.033). Conclusion Preliminary data suggest that elevated adiabatic T1? and T2? of cartilage are associated with morphological abnormalities of cartilage and bone, and thus may be applicable for in vivo OA research and diagnostics.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis To describe the acoustic characteristics of voice in individuals with motor speech disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Study Design Prospective study of 100 individuals with TBI based on consecutive referrals for motor speech evaluations. Methods Subjects were audio tape-recorded while producing sustained vowels and single word and sentence intelligibility tests. Laryngeal airway resistance was estimated, and voice quality was rated perceptually. Results None of the subjects evidenced vocal parameters within normal limits. The most frequently occurring abnormal parameter across subjects was amplitude perturbation, followed by voice turbulence index. Twenty-three percent of subjects evidenced deviation in all five parameters measured. The perceptual ratings of breathiness were significantly correlated with both the amplitude perturbation quotient and the noise-to-harmonics ratio. Conclusions Vocal quality deviation is common in motor speech disorders after TBI and may impact intelligibility.

AB  - Abstract Medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions play integral roles in memory function and are differentially affected in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The ability to structurally and functionally characterize these subregions may be important to understanding MTL physiology and diagnosing diseases involving the MTL. In this study, we characterized network architecture of the MTL in healthy subjects (n?=?31) using both resting state functional MRI and MTL-focused T2-weighted structural MRI at 7 tesla. Ten MTL subregions per hemisphere, including hippocampal subfields and cortical regions of the parahippocampal gyrus, were segmented for each subject using a multi-atlas algorithm. Both structural covariance matrices from correlations of subregion volumes across subjects, and functional connectivity matrices from correlations between subregion BOLD time series were generated. We found a moderate structural and strong functional inter-hemispheric symmetry. Several bilateral hippocampal subregions (CA1, dentate gyrus, and subiculum) emerged as functional network hubs. We also observed that the structural and functional networks naturally separated into two modules closely corresponding to (a) bilateral hippocampal formations, and (b) bilateral extra-hippocampal structures. Finally, we found a significant correlation in structural and functional connectivity (r?=?0.25). Our findings represent a comprehensive analysis of network topology of the MTL at the subregion level. We share our data, methods, and findings as a reference for imaging methods and disease-based research.

AB  - Objectives: Multiple topical treatments are often required for clinical cure of mycotic rhinosinusitis in dogs. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution and retention of enilconazole and clotrimazole solutions using a temporary trephination protocol. Methods: Nine client-owned dogs diagnosed with mycotic rhinosinusitis between March 2008 and December 2009 were prospectively enrolled and were sequentially allocated to receive treatment with either clotrimazole (1% in polyethylene glycol) or enilconazole (10% solution), after imaging and rhinoscopic assessment. Both frontal sinuses were trephined, debrided and flushed with saline. Infusion was administered via frontal sinuses with dogs in sternal recumbency and computed tomography (CT) performed 5 minutes after completion. Distribution was scored 1 to 4 at the canine tooth, premolar 4, cribriform plate and frontal sinus on both sides, for a maximum score of 32. Results: Distribution of antifungal agents to all regions of the nasal cavity and frontal sinuses was achievable, but varied considerably. Retention was poor in 10 of 18 regions assessed. Clinical Significance: Distribution of antifungal agents within the frontal sinuses is achievable using temporary trephination; however, distribution is variable and retention is often poor.

AB  - Background External beam radiation therapy can be used to treat pelvic tumors in dogs, but its utility is limited by lack of efficacy data and associated late complications. Hypothesis/Objectives The objective of this study was to assess local tumor control, overall survival, and toxicosis after intensity-modulated and image-guided radiation therapy (IM/IGRT) for treatment of genitourinary carcinomas (CGUC) in dogs. Animals 21 client-owned dogs. Methods A retrospective study was performed. Medical records of dogs for which there was intent to treat with a course of definitive-intent IM/IGRT for CGUC between 2008 and 2011 were reviewed. Descriptive and actuarial statistics comprised the data analysis. Results Primary tumors were located in the prostate (10), urinary bladder (9), or urethra (2). The total radiation dose ranged from 54?58 Gy, delivered in 20 daily fractions. Grade 1 and 2 acute gastrointestinal toxicoses developed in 33 and 5% of dogs, respectively. Grade 1 and 2 acute genitourinary and grade 1 acute integumentary toxicoses were documented in 5, 5, and 20% of dogs, respectively. Four dogs experienced late grade 3 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicosis. The subjective response rate was 60%. The median event-free survival was 317 days; the overall median survival time was 654 days. Neither local tumor control nor overall survival was statistically dependent upon location of the primary tumor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance IM/IGRT is generally well-tolerated and provides an effective option for locoregional control of CGUC. As compared with previous reports in the veterinary literature, inclusion of IM/IGRT in multimodal treatment protocols for CGUC can result in superior survival times; controlled prospective evaluation is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

AB  - Purpose The analysis of biological and mesoscopic structures properties by diffusion MRI (dMRI) in brain after radiation therapy remains challenging. In our study, we described the consequences associated with an unwanted dose to healthy tissue, assessing radiation-induced brain alterations of living rats with dMRI compared to histopathology and behavioral assays. Methods The right primary motor cortex M1 of the rat brain was targeted by stereotactic radiosurgery with a mean radiation dose of 41 Gy. Multidirectional single b-value dMRI data of the whole brain were acquired with a 7T small-animal scanner before irradiation until 110 days post-irradiation. Diffusion tensor imaging metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were compared to brain alterations detected by immunohistochemistry and motor performances measured by a behavioral test. Results Between days 90 and 110, radiation necrosis was observed into the white matter spreading into M1. Results showed a reduction of FA in the corpus callosum and in the striatum, which was driven by an increase in RD from 90 to 110 days post-irradiation, whereas only RD increased in M1. Values of RD and AD increased in the irradiated hippocampus, while FA remained constant. Moreover, an increased MD, AD and RD was observed in the hippocampus that was probably related to inflammation as well as reactive astrogliosis after 110 days post-irradiation. Finally, rats did not exhibit locomotor deficits. Conclusions dMRI metrics can assess brain damage; the sensitivity of dMRI metrics depends on the brain region.

AB  - Background Bone marrow fat increases when bone mass decreases, which could be attributed to the fact that adipogenesis competes with osteogenesis. Bone marrow fat has the potential to predict abnormal bone density and osteoporosis. Purpose To investigate the predictive value of using vertebral bone marrow fat fraction(BMFF) obtained from modified Dixon(mDixon) Quant in the determination of abnormal bone density and osteoporosis. Study type Prospective. Population 257 subjects (age: 20?79 years old; BMI: 16.6?32.9?kg/m2;181 females,76 males) without known spinal tumor, history of trauma, dysplasia, spinal surgery or hormone therapy. Field strength/sequence 3.0T/mDixon. Assessment BMFF was measured at the L1, L2 and L3 vertebral body on fat fraction maps of the lumbar spine. Bone mineral density (BMD) was obtained using quantitative computed tomography, which served as the reference standard. Statistical tests The BMFF between the three groups (normal bone density, osteopenia and osteoporosis) was tested using one-way analysis of variance in SPSS. The correlation and partial correlation of BMFF and BMD were analyzed before and after controlling for age, sex and BMI. Logistic regression analysis using independent training and validation data was conducted to evaluate the performance of predicting abnormal BMD or osteoporosis using BMFF. Results There was a significant difference in vertebral BMFF between the three groups (P?<?0.001). Moderate inverse correlation was found between vertebral BMFF and BMD after controlling age, sex and BMI (r?=?-0.529; P?<?0.001). The mean area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) for predicting abnormal bone density were 0.940, 0.877, 0.896, and 0.890, respectively. The corresponding results for predicting subjects with osteoporosis were 0.896, 0.848, 0.853, and 0.969, respectively. Data conclusion mDixon Quant is a fast, simple, noninvasive and nonionizing method to access vertebral BMFF and has a high predictive power for identifying abnormal bone density and osteoporosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a known risk factor for future development of osteoarthritis (OA). This human clinical study seeks to determine if early changes to cartilage MRI T2 maps between baseline and 6 months following ACL reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with changes to cartilage T2 and cartilage thickness between baseline and 2 years after ACLR. Changes to T2 texture metrics and T2 mean values in medial knee cartilage of 17 human subjects 6 months after ACLR were compared to 2-year changes in T2 and in cartilage thickness of the same areas. T2 texture and mean assessments were also compared to that of 11 uninjured controls. In ACLR subjects, six-month changes in mean T2 correlated to 2-year changes in mean T2 (R?=?0.80, p?=?0.0001), and 6-month changes to T2 texture metrics, but not T2 mean, correlated with 2-year changes in medial femoral cartilage thickness in 9 of the 20 texture features assessed (R?=?0.48?0.72, p?≤?0.05). Both mean T2 and texture differed (p?<?0.05) between ALCR subjects and uninjured controls. Clinical Significance: These results show that short-term longitudinal evaluation of T2 map and textural changes may provide early warning of cartilage at risk for progressive degeneration after ACL injury and reconstruction. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Abstract. The authors have recently demonstrated that increased gene expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) in hemorrhagic hypotension (HH) and following lactated Ringer's resuscitation (LR) is associated with a decrease in insulin and an increase in corticosterone concentrations. Objective: To evaluate the in-vivo role of hormones the authors used insulin (IN), phentolamine and propranolol (PP) as an adrenergic blocker, and cyclic somatostatin (CS) as a glucagon blocker to prevent the induction of Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney following HH and LR. Methods: Hemorrhage was induced in fasted anesthetized rats, and the reduction of blood pressure to 40 mm Hg for a duration of 30 minutes was accomplished by withdrawal or infusion of shed blood. The resuscitated group underwent hemorrhage followed by fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Results: Neither PP nor CS treatment could block the induction of Glu-6-Pase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) following either HH or LR. However, the administration of IN significantly prevented the increase of Glu-6-Pase mRNA level and activity in both liver and kidney following HH and LR. This was associated with a normalization of plasma glucose, corticosterone, and glucagon levels and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in liver and kidney toward prehemorrhage levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that in-vivo treatment with insulin during hemorrhagic hypotension and resuscitation is capable of preventing the increase in Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney responsible for the observed hyperglycemia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Focal ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage (EGC) during endochondral ossification is believed to be a key early event on the pathway to osteochondrosis (OC) in both animals and humans. The lateral ridge of the equine trochlea is a site where severe osteochondritis dissecans lesions frequently arise and is a model for the study of naturally occurring disease. Non-invasive imaging to investigate EGC vascularity may help elucidate why focal ischemia occurs. 3T MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of femoral trochlea of OC predisposed (n?=?10) and control (n?=?6) day-old foals, with minimal joint loading after birth, was performed. SWI and 3D images revealed the EGC vascular architecture without a contrast agent, and matched histologic observations. No vascular lesions were identified. There was no difference in the vascular density and architecture between control and OC specimens, but a striking difference in vascular pattern was seen at the OC-predilected site in the lateral ridge of the trochlea in all specimens, when compared to the medial ridge of the trochlea, where OC lesions are rarely observed. This site was less ossified with more perichondrial vessels not yet bridging with the subchondral bone. Furthermore, the mean vascular density of all specimens was significantly higher at this site. We speculate that joint morphology and focal internal trauma on this site with a unique vascular architecture may trigger ischemic events at this site. SWI permitted visualization of EGC in young foals with a clinical 3T MRI and paves the way for non-destructive longitudinal studies to improve understanding of OC in all species. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Purpose To propose a methodology for assessment of algorithms that correct distortions due to motion, eddy-currents, and echo planar imaging in diffusion weighted images (DWIs). Methods The proposed method evaluates correction performance by measuring variability across datasets of the same object acquired with images having distortions in different directions, thereby overcoming the unavailability of ground-truth, undistorted DWIs. A comprehensive diffusion MRI dataset, collected using a suitable experimental design, is made available to the scientific community, consisting of three DWI shells (Bmax = 5000 s/mm2), 30 gradient directions, a replicate set of antipodal gradient directions, four phase-encoding directions, and three different head orientations. The proposed methodology was tested using the TORTOISE diffusion MRI processing pipeline. Results The median variability of the original distorted data was 123% higher for DWIs, 100?168% higher for tensor-derived metrics and 28?111% higher for MAPMRI metrics, than in the corrected versions. EPI distortions induced substantial variability, nearly comparable to the contribution of eddy-current distortions. Conclusions The dataset and the evaluation strategy proposed herein enable quantitative comparison of different methods for correction of distortions due to motion, eddy-currents, and other EPI distortions, and can be useful in benchmarking newly developed algorithms.

AB  - Objective To describe clinical outcome and technical outcome assessed using computed tomography (CT) in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLSS) treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy, and transarticular screw fixation. Study Design Retrospective observational case series. Animals Dogs with DLSS (n?=?17). Methods Dogs with neurologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings compatible with DLSS treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy and transarticular screw fixation were enrolled. Pre- and postoperative neurologic status was compared. Lumbosacral (LS) angle in extension and misalignment in preoperative MRI were compared with the postoperative CT. Residual mobility of the LS joint after fixation was also evaluated. Status of screws, presence of new bone formation over screw heads/articular facets and presence of adjacent segment disease (ASD) were assessed. Results Median CT follow-up was 12 months. Clinical improvement was seen in 13 dogs, 2 dogs had intermittent LS pain, and 2 dogs needed revision surgery. In 5 dogs, screws were either pulled out or broken. Reduction of LS angle in extension and misalignment was achieved. Residual mobility of the LS segment was present and ASD was not recognized. Conclusions Transarticular screw fixation in dogs with DLSS is associated with a considerable number of technical failures and does not result in rigid stabilization; however, this did not significantly adversely influence clinical outcome.

AB  - Deep learning is one of the most exciting new areas in medical imaging. This review article provides a summary of the current clinical applications of deep learning for lesion detection, progression, and prediction of musculoskeletal disease on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine. Deep-learning methods have shown success for estimating pediatric bone age, detecting fractures, and assessing the severity of osteoarthritis on radiographs. In particular, the high diagnostic performance of deep-learning approaches for estimating pediatric bone age and detecting fractures suggests that the new technology may soon become available for use in clinical practice. Recent studies have also documented the feasibility of using deep-learning methods for identifying a wide variety of pathologic abnormalities on CT and MRI including internal derangement, metastatic disease, infection, fractures, and joint degeneration. However, the detection of musculoskeletal disease on CT and especially MRI is challenging, as it often requires analyzing complex abnormalities on multiple slices of image datasets with different tissue contrasts. Thus, additional technical development is needed to create deep-learning methods for reliable and repeatable interpretation of musculoskeletal CT and MRI examinations. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of all deep-learning methods for detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal disease must be evaluated in prospective studies using large image datasets acquired at different institutions with different imaging parameters and different imaging hardware before they can be implemented in clinical practice.
