AB  - Deep learning is one of the most exciting new areas in medical imaging. This review article provides a summary of the current clinical applications of deep learning for lesion detection, progression, and prediction of musculoskeletal disease on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine. Deep-learning methods have shown success for estimating pediatric bone age, detecting fractures, and assessing the severity of osteoarthritis on radiographs. In particular, the high diagnostic performance of deep-learning approaches for estimating pediatric bone age and detecting fractures suggests that the new technology may soon become available for use in clinical practice. Recent studies have also documented the feasibility of using deep-learning methods for identifying a wide variety of pathologic abnormalities on CT and MRI including internal derangement, metastatic disease, infection, fractures, and joint degeneration. However, the detection of musculoskeletal disease on CT and especially MRI is challenging, as it often requires analyzing complex abnormalities on multiple slices of image datasets with different tissue contrasts. Thus, additional technical development is needed to create deep-learning methods for reliable and repeatable interpretation of musculoskeletal CT and MRI examinations. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of all deep-learning methods for detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal disease must be evaluated in prospective studies using large image datasets acquired at different institutions with different imaging parameters and different imaging hardware before they can be implemented in clinical practice.

AB  - A consensus-validation study used action research methods to identify relevant nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, and patient outcomes for a population of adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in long-term care. In meetings totaling 159 hours to reach 100% consensus through group discussions, the three classifications of NANDA International's (NANDA-I's) approved nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), and the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) were used as the basis for three nurses experienced in working with adults with TBI to select the elements of nursing care. Among almost 200 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, 29 were identified as relevant for comprehensive nursing care of this population. Each nursing diagnosis was associated with 3?11 of the more than 500 NIC interventions and 1?13 of more than 300 NOC outcomes. The nurses became aware of the complexity and the need for critical thinking. The findings were used to refine the facility's nursing standards of care, which were to be combined with the interdisciplinary plan of care and included in future electronic health records.

AB  - OGILVIE R., MCCLOUGHEN A., CURTIS K. & FOSTER K. (2012) The experience of surviving life-threatening injury: a qualitative synthesis. International Nursing Review59, 312?320 Background:? To summarize and synthesize research that explored the experience of surviving life-threatening injury in adolescents, young persons and adults. Methods:? Informed by systematic literature review strategies, a description of the experience of individuals who survived life-threatening injury was sought by reviewing 13 studies with qualitative data on the phenomena. Data were managed using NVivo software and synthesized using thematic analysis to elicit meaning. Results:? The review synthesized a substantial number (n?=?273) of participant experiences of traumatic surviving life-threatening injury and revealed that during the initial 3 years following life-threatening injury, the individual goes through a shifting, iterative process in order to reconstruct various aspects of their injury and themselves, including mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and relational facets. Three major themes were illuminated: a time of chaos, negotiating injury and reconciling injury. In order to navigate through the experience of injury, family members were key sources of affirmation and support in anchoring the person to their life, in reconstructing themselves in the aftermath of injury and in coming to terms with the impacts of injury. Conclusion:? This qualitative synthesis describes the iterative process individuals go through following life-threatening injury and the overwhelming need to reconstruct aspects of self as a way to create meaning. It demonstrates the need to gain further understanding of the influence of the family in recovery from injury and indicates that education is required to provide practical strategies to assist clinicians to develop appropriate and relevant patient goals and expectations.

AB  - Objectives To compare the olfactory bulb volumes (OBVs) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) to healthy individuals, and to assess the changes of the OBVs in patients with CRSwNP before and after the endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) utilising magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with specialised software. Design This is a prospective cohort study. Setting Tanta University hospital (tertiary referral hospital), Egypt. Participants Thirty patients with CRSwNP (Group A) were compared with thirty healthy individuals (Group B) as regards the OBVs. Patients with CRSwNP underwent ESS where the Smell Identification Test-40 (SIT-40) and the OBVs were assessed pre-operatively and at least 6 months postoperatively. Assessment of the OBVs was carried out using MRI with specialised software. Main outcome measures Assessment of the volumetric changes of the olfactory bulbs in patients with CRSwNP before and after endoscopic sinus surgery utilise magnetic resonance imaging. Results The OBVs were significantly smaller in Group A (58.94 ± 7.96 mm3 and 60.79 ± 8.14 mm3 on the right and left sides, respectively) as compared with the Group B (73.46 ± 8.54 mm3 and 72.96 ± 9.74 mm3 on the right and left sides, respectively). There was also a significant increase in the olfactory bulb volumes as well as improvement of the SIT-40 6 months postoperatively in the Group A. Conclusions The olfactory bulb is characterised by neural plasticity, and its volume may be affected by the peripheral olfactory function.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract:? The term active imagination is sometimes applied rather uncritically to describe all forms of creative activity that take place in depth psychology. Whilst there are many forms of expression that evoke or are evoked by active imagination, they cannot automatically be classed as active imagination. In this article investigation of visualized mental imagery, dreams and art reveals three distinct forms of image-based psychological activity. Integrated and mediated within the transference and countertransference dynamic, it is proposed that the engagement in active imagination reflects and is influenced by the transference. Distinctions between sign and symbol, simple and big dreams as well as diagrammatic and embodied imagery clarify the differences. Examples from clinical practice demonstrate each mode in action within the analytic frame.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Morphological abnormalities of the levator ani are found in a significant minority of women presenting with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction. In this study quantification of such injuries using tomographic three-dimensional (3D) pelvic floor ultrasound was attempted. Methods In a prospective observational study undertaken at two tertiary urogynecological clinics, 262 consecutive women referred for complaints of lower urinary tract dysfunction and prolapse underwent an interview, clinical assessment and 3D translabial ultrasound imaging. Blinded offline analysis of volume datasets was performed at a later date using 4D View software. Main outcome measures were craniocaudal and ventrodorsal extent of defects of the pubovisceral muscle. Results Avulsion injuries were diagnosed in 50 women (19%; 21.3% of the vaginally parous). Defects were found unilaterally (right, n = 17; left, n = 12) and bilaterally (n = 21). In some women they affected the entire volume; in others defects were visible in only two of 16 slices. Hiatal area on Valsalva was correlated weakly with defect score (r = 0.28, P = 0.05) and total defect width (r = 0.4, P = 0.005). Defect score (P = 0.001) and maximum width (P = 0.002) were significantly higher in women who presented with symptoms of prolapse. Defect score was associated with cystocele as assessed clinically (P = 0.021) and on ultrasound (P = 0.014). Conclusions Depth and width of levator ani defects can be quantified by tomographic pelvic floor ultrasound. These parameters are associated with the likelihood of symptoms of prolapse and cystocele descent, but not with incontinence. Copyright ? 2007 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, synovitis, subchondral bone changes, and osteophyte formation. Currently there is no treatment for OA except temporary pain relief and end-stage joint replacement surgery. We performed a pilot study to determine the effect of kartogenin (KGN, a small molecule) on both cartilage and subchondral bone in a rat model of OA using multimodal imaging techniques. OA was induced in rats (OA and KGN treatment group) by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) surgery in the right knee joint. Sham surgery was performed on the right knee joint of control group rats. KGN group rats received weekly intra-articular injection of 125??M KGN 1 week after surgery until week 12. All rats underwent in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Quantitative MR relaxation measures (T1? and T2) were determined to evaluate changes in articular cartilage. Cartilage and bone turnover markers (COMP and CTX-I) were determined at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at week 12 and the knee joints were removed for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. KGN treatment significantly lowered the T1? and T2 relaxation times indicating decreased cartilage degradation. KGN treatment significantly decreased COMP and CTX-I levels indicating decreased cartilage and bone turnover rate. KGN treatment also prevented subchondral bone changes in the ACLT rat model of OA. Thus, kartogenin is a potential drug to prevent joint deterioration in post-traumatic OA. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 34:1780?1789, 2016.

AB  - Summary Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness and visual disability worldwide. Of the known contributing factors to this condition, ionising radiation is considered the primary concern in a radiological context given the particular radiosensitivity of the lens of the eye. In light of the substantially increased application of computed tomography in brain imaging, an investigation of the relevent literature is warranted to assess thresholds, lens radiation doses and dose reduction techniques in respect to the cataractogenic risk of such examinations. The value and very existence of a lens dose threshold is debatable given different considerations of radiation dose, latency, opacity classifications and historical sample populations, though ICRP guidelines suggest a threshold of 0.5 Gy. Documented CT-specific radiation doses to the eye following scans of the brain are highly variable between studies (2?130 mGy), primarily owing to discrepancies in scanning technique. These findings, when coupled with the relative ambiguity of known threshold values, present difficulties in assessing the overall risk of cataracts following serial CT examinations to the head. In the absence of definitive risk evaluations, a cautionary approach is advised. The implementation of gantry tilt along the supraorbital margin is recommended as standard practice on account of its highly effective radiation dose reduction outcomes. Organ-based tube modulation and reductions in tube current may also be considered beneficial. Bismuth eye shielding is only advised where gantry tilting is unachievable, and in such cases, ensure careful adherence to appropriate shield placement and infection control measures.

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with attention/arousal dysregulation and possible inefficiencies in some cognitive functions. However, the neurobiological bases of these teratogenic effects have not been well characterized. Because activities in the default mode network (DMN) reflect intrinsic brain functions that are closely associated with arousal regulation and cognition, alterations in the DMN could underlie cognitive effects related to PCE. With resting-state and task activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the possible PCE related changes in functional brain connectivity and brain activation in the DMN. In the resting state, the PCE group was found to have stronger functional connectivity in the DMN, as compared to the nonexposed controls. During a working memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE group exhibited less deactivation in the DMN and their fMRI signal was more increased by emotional arousal. These data revealed additional neural effects related to PCE, and consistent with previous findings, indicate that PCE may affect behavior and functioning by increasing baseline arousal and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balancing mechanisms involved in cognitive resource allocation.

AB  - Abstract To facilitate research cooperation among the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, ISAC supported the Epona Cytometry Conference in eastern Hungary near Debrecen and the Hortobágy National Park. This was the first ISAC sponsored conference held in Hungary. The 150 attendees included scientists from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. There was also representation from Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Presentations and posters were of typically high ISAC quality. In addition, the Epona meeting attracted an impressive selection of commercial exhibits that provided contacts and improved the awareness of advanced analytical cytology for the attendees. The Epona conference was organized with Hungarian passion and skill by Professor Sandor Damjanovich, Dr. Jànos Szollosi, and the members of the Biophysics and Cell Biology Department of the Medical School of Debrecen. The Department has been active in cytometry for over 20 years, and in hosting the conference, it also celebrated the 20th anniversary of its installment of the first cell sorter in Eastern Europe. The successful meeting demonstrates that Hungarians are strong contenders for the organization of future ISAC meetings. During my 1999 Fulbright Scholarship in Professor Damjanovich's Department, I traveled extensively and can verify that there are other unique sites in Hungary?Sopron, Pécs, Lake Balaton, and Budapest?for ISAC meetings. The site of the conference was on the Hungarian Puszta or plain near the Hortobágy National Park, which offered tours to observe ?Hungarian Cowboys,? long-horned cattle, twisted-horn sheep, hairy pigs, and water buffalo, which were brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Magyars. Located in beautiful grasslands on the edge of the Park, the Epona Village was an excellent site for the meeting and is distinctly Hungarian. The timing of the conference was dramatic. Hungary was admitted to NATO in April and the Kosovo conflict with Yugoslavia began a few weeks later. During the conference, NATO air raids into Kosovo were being conducted from bases in southern Hungary. There was much concerned discussion among the attendees of the Kosovo situation. All regretted the loss of life, and all shared the hope that creating cooperative projects in science, agriculture, business, and education will lower international tension. In supporting the Epona conference, ISAC contributed importantly to cooperative science.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

AB  - Purpose To establish a new imaging technique using dynamic MRI three-dimensional (3D) volumetric acquisition in real-time, on six normal shoulders for the analysis of the 3D shoulder kinematics during continuous motion. Materials and Methods At first, a standard static acquisition was performed. Then, fast images were obtained with a multi-slice 3D balanced gradient echo sequence to get a real time series during the initial phase of shoulder abduction. Subsequently, the images were reconstructed; registered and the translational patterns of the humeral head relative to the glenoid and the size of the subacromial space were calculated. Additionally, the intraobserver reproducibility was tested. Results The maximal abduction was on average 43° (30° to 60°) and the mean width of the subacromial space was 7.7 mm (SD:?±?1.2 mm). Difference between extreme values and average values was low, respectively 2.5 mm on X-axis, 2 mm on Y-axis, 1.4 mm for the width of the subacromial space and 1.2° for the measure of the glenohumeral abduction. Conclusion This study reported a dynamic MRI protocol for the monitoring of shoulder 3D kinematics during continuous movement. The results suggest that there is no superior shift of the humeral head during the first phase of abduction. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:729?734. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A nine-year-old female Rottweiler presented with a 6-week history of progressive impairment of hindlimb adduction. Clinical examination showed abduction of both hind legs when walking on a smooth surface, pain at the medial surface of the left thigh, and an intrarectal palpable mass at the pelvic floor. Electromyography demonstrated fibrillation potentials in the adductor muscles on both sides. Pelvic radiographs showed severe osteolysis of the ischium. Gross post-mortem examination following euthanasia disclosed a large retroperitoneal mass, invading the obturator foramina and compressing both obturator nerves. Histopathological examination revealed a high-grade anaplastic sarcoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells labelled positively for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin, hence the tumour was considered a ?myofibroblastic fibrosarcoma?. This unique case report describes a novel cause of obturator neuropathy in veterinary medicine. To date, clinical descriptions of obturator nerve lesions have been limited to pelvic fractures in small animals and following difficult labour in large animals.

AB  - Background:? We examined the prevalence and nature of comorbid post-traumatic stress reactions and depressive symptoms, and the impact of exposure to traumatic events on both types of psychopathology, among Palestinian children during war conflict in the region. Methods:? The 403 children aged 9?15 years, who lived in four refugee camps, were assessed by completing the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Results:? Children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media. CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Both CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were independently predicted by the number of experienced traumatic events, and this association remained after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. In contrast, the association between traumatic events and CPTSD-RI scores, while controlling for MFQ scores, was weak. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. However, not all remaining CPTSD-RI items were significantly associated with exposure to traumatic events, thus raising the possibility that the association between depression and PTSD was due in part to symptom overlap. Conclusions:? Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate a systemic induction of bone formation in rats by immunosuppression with FK506 (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally [ip]) in a model of osteoinduction of isogeneic and xenogeneic demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for a period of 28 days. In particular, alterations of in vitro cytokine synthesis and changes of lymphocyte subsets were studied. DBM was implanted intramuscularly in the abdominal wall of Lewis rats (seven per group). Blood was sampled on days ?7, 0, 7, and 28 for determination of in vitro tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) synthesis and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, ED9+, and Ia+ antibodies). Ossicles of de novo formed bone and the tibias were removed on day 28 after double tetracycline labeling for histomorphometric analysis. Immunosuppression with FK506 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated in vitro cytokine synthesis after 7 days and 28 days (p < 0.05). Compared with control animals FK506 treatment significantly increased the volume of induced bone in isogeneic (2.1 ± 0.3 mm3 vs. 10.8 ± 0.9 mm3) and xenogeneic (0 mm3 vs. 4.7 ± 0.8 mm3) DBM. Bone histomorphometry of the tibias revealed that immunosuppression increased both bone formation and bone resorption, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative trabecular area (Tb.Ar). FK506 caused a decrease in the counts of CD8+ T cells probably because of destruction or dislocation of these cells. This suggests that the amount of CD8+ cells and the degree of T cell activation in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) may be associated with bone metabolism. In support of this, statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between parameters of bone formation as well as bone resorption and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. There was a significant negative correlation between parameters of remodeling of the metaphysis of the tibia and induced bone volume (BV), respectively, and MFI values of CD3+/Ia+ cells. These findings suggest an important role of T lymphocytes in bone formation and bone resorption in vivo. FK506 caused a marked increase of bone formation in DBM. However, the conclusion that immunosuppression increases fracture healing warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To test the ability of susceptibility weighted images (SWI) and high pass filtered phase images to localize and quantify brain iron. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance (MR) images of human cadaver brain hemispheres were collected using a gradient echo based SWI sequence at 1.5T. For X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, each brain was cut to obtain slices that reasonably matched the MR images and iron was mapped at the iron K-edge at 50 or 100 ?m resolution. Iron was quantified using XRF calibration foils. Phase and iron XRF were averaged within anatomic regions of one slice, chosen for its range of iron concentrations and nearly perfect anatomic correspondence. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to determine if the chemical form of iron was different in regions with poorer correspondence between iron and phase. Results: Iron XRF maps, SWI, and high pass filtered phase data in nine brain slices from five subjects were visually very similar, particularly in high iron regions. The chemical form of iron could not explain poor matches. The correlation between the concentration of iron and phase in the cadaver brain was estimated as cFe [?g/g tissue] = 850?? + 110. Conclusion: The phase shift ?? was found to vary linearly with iron concentration with the best correspondence found in regions with high iron content. J. Magn. Reson.
