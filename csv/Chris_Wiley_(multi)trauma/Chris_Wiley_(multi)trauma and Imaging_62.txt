AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognitive function. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) offers a non-invasive approach to delineate the effects of AD on white matter (WM) integrity. Previous studies calculated either some summary statistics over regions of interest (ROI analysis) or some statistics along mean skeleton lines (Tract Based Spatial Statistic [TBSS]), so they cannot quantify subtle local WM alterations along major tracts. Here, a comprehensive WM analysis framework to map disease effects on 3D tracts both locally and globally, based on a study of 200 subjects: 49 healthy elderly normal controls, 110 with mild cognitive impairment, and 41 AD patients has been presented. 18 major WM tracts were extracted with our automated clustering algorithm?autoMATE (automated Multi-Atlas Tract Extraction); we then extracted multiple DWI-derived parameters of WM integrity along the WM tracts across all subjects. A novel statistical functional analysis method?FADTTS (Functional Analysis for Diffusion Tensor Tract Statistics) was applied to quantify degenerative patterns along WM tracts across different stages of AD. Gradually increasing WM alterations were found in all tracts in successive stages of AD. Among all 18 WM tracts, the fornix was most adversely affected. Among all the parameters, mean diffusivity (MD) was the most sensitive to WM alterations in AD. This study provides a systematic workflow to examine WM integrity across automatically computed 3D tracts in AD and may be useful in studying other neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma in the form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts more Americans annually than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease combined, yet few researchers have used neuroproteomics to investigate the underlying complex molecular events that exacerbate TBI. Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

AB  - Abstract Recent evidence suggests that military suicide rates now exceed those of the general public. Numerous recent efforts to address this growing concern have focused on the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS). In the current study, we explored the relationships among reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and the three components of the IPTS in a sample of deployed military personnel examined for traumatic brain injury. Results indicated that reexperiencing symptoms were directly related to the acquired capability for suicide, but their relationships to perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were statistically explained by general mental health distress. Results indicate that mental rehearsal of painful and provocative experiences may have an impact on suicide risk. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 67:1?10, 2011.

AB  - Purpose To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. Materials and Methods Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n?=?22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n?=?22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. Results Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P?=?0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P?=?0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P?≤?0.0001, 0.004; P?=?0.004, 0.006). Conclusion FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries. Level of Evidence: 2 J.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this multi-center study, voxel-based relaxometry (VBR), a novel technique to automatically quantify localized cartilage change, was used to investigate T1? and T2 relaxation times of patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at the time of injury and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1? times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1? increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1? and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract This study evaluated the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment program for children with obesity (OB) on motor competence, executive functioning (EF), and brain structure. Nineteen children with OB (7?11 years), who attended a multidisciplinary treatment program consisting of diet restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical activity, were compared with an age-matched control group of 24 children with a healthy weight (HW), who did not follow any treatment. For both groups, anthropometric measurements and tests of motor competence and EF were administered twice, with 5 months between pretest and posttest. Additionally, children?s brain structure was assessed by performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at the pretest and posttest, which included a T1 anatomical scan, diffusion MRI scan, and magnetization transfer imaging scan. Compared to HW controls, children with OB lost a considerable amount of their body mass (p?≤?.001) and significantly improved their balance skills (p?≤?.001), while no transfer effects of the program were observed for EF. Furthermore, the program resulted in a significant increase in total (p?≤?.001) and cerebellar (p?≤?.001) gray matter volume in children with OB, while no change was observed in the HW controls. Finally, only weak to moderate (nonsignificant) correlations could be observed between structural brain alterations, weight-related changes, and behavioral improvements. Altogether, this is the first longitudinal study showing behavioral and structural brain alterations in response to a multidisciplinary weight loss program for children with OB. Our findings support the need for multidimensional intervention (and prevention) measures for children with OB to deal with this multifactorial health problem.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Lymphangiomas are very rare benign tumors of the lymphatic system, appearing as uniseptate or multiseptate cystic masses, which are usually located in the cervical or axillary area. Postnatal outcome depends on the size and location of the lesion. An increasing number of such congenital abnormalities are detected on routine conventional prenatal ultrasonography. Although prenatal evaluation for the prognosis of fetal lymphangioma has been based on two-dimensional ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging may help in assessing the extent of a lesion. Isolated lymphangiomas generally have a favourable prognosis and sclerotherapy or surgical resection is effective in most of the cases. Case presentation: We present two cases of fetal axillary lymphangioma. In the first case, the lymphangioma was diagnosed antenatally, so parents were comprehensively counselled and post natal follow up was organised at a tertiary hospital. The second case remained undiagnosed until birth. This caused significant distress to both the parents and clinicians, especially after a coincident traumatic delivery. Conclusion: Both these cases emphasise that early diagnosis of fetal lymphangioma is critical and a combination of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging can facilitate detection of lesions which are relatively limited and accessible to therapy in utero. This would also enable clinicians to perform a karyotype and comprehensively consult parents regarding the treatment and delivery options as well as outcome of the pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The finite element (FE) method is the most powerful modelling technique available to explicate the biomechanics of the digit. It has already proved to be of high value in human podiatry. However, accurate models of the complex anatomy of the horse and donkey digit are currently lacking. Objectives: To develop FE models of the horse and donkey digit from computed tomography data, including all functionally relevant anatomy, and to perform simulations to replicate prestrain in the flexor tendons and quasistatic weightbearing. Methods: Computed tomography data of the front right digits were obtained under general anaesthesia. The anatomy was rationalised into 32 functional components. The FE models were generated using a forward engineering technique. Linear or nonlinear material properties were applied according to published data. Prestraining of the flexor tendons was achieved by z-direction displacement, and loading by the application of 1 ? body mass. Results: The resultant FE models comprised over 106 elements. Z-direction displacement of the digital flexor tendons to compensate for general anaesthesia relaxation gave von Mises stress levels up to 1.34 MPa for the deep and 0.56 MPa for the superficial in the horse and 0.78 MPa and 0.27 MPa in the donkey, respectively. Weightbearing resulted in capsular deformation patterns consistent with in vivo observations, and maximum stress levels of 1.46 MPa for the horse and 0.89 MPa for the donkey. Conclusion: These high resolution FE models could give new insight into the biomechanics of the equid digit and provide new data regarding stress and strain levels within the tissues of the digit that are unobtainable by other means. Potential relevance: Application of the FE modelling technique could enable investigation of the biomechanics of orthopaedic problems and may provide a mechanistic basis for enhanced preventative and remedial management and treatment.

Methods Outer-volume-suppression (OVS) saturation and 1D/2D 31P CSI were utilized to reveal the presence of an additional component in the signal. Results 67% of the head extracellular Pi signal was attenuated upon OVS saturation of the peripheral meningeal tissues, likely reflecting elimination of the Pi signal in the meningeal fluids (the blood and CSF). Localized 1D/2D CSI data provided further support for this assignment. Upon correction for the meningeal contribution, the extracellular Pi concentration was 0.51?±?0.07?mM, whereas the intracellular Pi was 0.85?±?0.10?mM. The extracellular pH was measured as 7.32?±?0.04 when using OVS, as compared to 7.39?±?0.03 when measured without OVS (N?=?7 subjects). Conclusion The extracellular Pi signal acquired from the human head using nonlocalized 31P MRS contains a significant component likely contributed by peripheral blood and CSF in meninges that must be removed in order to use this signal as an endogenous probe for measuring extracellular pH and other properties in the brain.

Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Horses (n?=?16) that had CT-guided internal fixation of the distal phalanx (DP) or distal sesamoid bone (DSB). Methods Drill bit entry point and direction were planned from CT image series performed on hooves with grids of barium paste dots at proposed entry and projected exit sites. Post-implantation CT images were obtained to check screw position and length as well as fracture reduction. Imaging, reduction, and surgical and general anesthesia times were evaluated. Outcome was recorded. Results Screw position and length were considered near optimal in all horses, with no consequential malposition of bits or screws. Fracture reduction was evident in all cases. Preoperative planning times (at least 2 CT image acquisitions and grid creation) ranged from 10 to 20?minutes. Surgery time ranged from 45 to 90?minutes (mean, 61?minutes) and general anesthesia time ranged from 115 to 220?minutes (mean, 171?minutes). Conclusions The combination of CT and surface marker grids allowed accurate positioning of screws in clinical DP and DSB fractures. The technique was simple and rapid. An aiming device is useful for the technique.

AB  - Purpose To quantify spatial and temporal inflammation-induced changes in vascular permeability and macrophage infiltration in guinea-pig (GP) cochlea using MRI. Materials and Methods GPs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cochlear inflammation. One group was injected with a gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was performed at 4, 7, and 10 days after LPS treatment. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to determine the apparent rate constant of GBCA extravasation (Ktrans). A second group was injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) and studied at 2, 3, and 7 days after LPS treatment to detect tissue USPIO uptake and correlate with histology. For both groups, control GPs were scanned similarly. Results The signal enhancement increased substantially and more rapidly at day 4 in LPS-treated than in control cochlea shortly following GBCA injection. Ktrans of LPS-treated cochlea was maximum on day 4 at 0.0218?±?0.0032 min?1 and then decreased to control level at 0.0036?±?0.0004 min?1 by day 10. In the second group, the relative signal intensity and T2 in cochlear perilymphatic spaces on day 2 decreased, on average, by 54% and 45%, respectively, compared with baseline and then remained under control levels by day 7. This suggests the infiltration of inflammatory cells, although unconfirmed by histology. Conclusion This provides the first measurement of cochlear vascular permeability using MRI and a quantitative evaluation of the development of cochlear inflammation. MRI holds considerable potential for the assessment of disease processes such as clinical diagnosis of conditions such as labyrinthitis. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - Purpose Amplified magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) was recently introduced as a new brain motion detection and visualization method. The original aMRI approach used a video-processing algorithm, Eulerian video magnification (EVM), to amplify cardio-ballistic motion in retrospectively cardiac-gated MRI data. Here, we strive to improve aMRI by incorporating a phase-based motion amplification algorithm. Methods Phase-based aMRI was developed and tested for correct implementation and ability to amplify sub-voxel motions using digital phantom simulations. The image quality of phase-based aMRI was compared with EVM-based aMRI in healthy volunteers at 3T, and its amplified motion characteristics were compared with phase-contrast MRI. Data were also acquired on a patient with Chiari I malformation, and qualitative displacement maps were produced using free form deformation (FFD) of the aMRI output. Results Phantom simulations showed that phase-based aMRI has a linear dependence of amplified displacement on true displacement. Amplification was independent of temporal frequency, varying phantom intensity, Rician noise, and partial volume effect. Phase-based aMRI supported larger amplification factors than EVM-based aMRI and was less sensitive to noise and artifacts. Abnormal biomechanics were seen on FFD maps of the Chiari I malformation patient. Conclusion Phase-based aMRI might be used in the future for quantitative analysis of minute changes in brain motion and may reveal subtle physiological variations of the brain as a result of pathology using processing of the fundamental harmonic or by selectively varying temporal harmonics. Preliminary data shows the potential of phase-based aMRI to qualitatively assess abnormal biomechanics in Chiari I malformation.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a rapidly developing non-invasive imaging method that can depict the biliopancreatic ducts. Compared to direct methods such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is not painful, does not require contrast media, and its success does not depend, to any great extent, on the operator's skill. It uses three-dimensional data sets for projection images, as well as arbitrary cross-sectional iamges. Faster data acquisition techniques are expanding its indications as a diagnostic tool. MRCP is undoubtedly the method of choice when ERCP is contraindicated or fails. Imaging after the injection of secretin improves pancreatic duct delineation, and may also add functional information to MRCP. Adequate diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, and mucinous ductal ectasia may also be feasible. Further development and optimization of MRCP will substantially limit the indications for diagnostic endoscopic pancreatography.

AB  - Abstract Controlling mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) shape is a novel method for investigating and directing MSC behaviour in vitro. it was hypothesized that specifigc MSC shapes can be generated by using stiffness-defined biomaterial surfaces and by applying cyclic tensile forces. Biomaterials used were thin and thick silicone sheets, fibronectin coating, and compacted collagen type I sheets. The MSC morphology was quantified by shape descriptors describing dimensions and membrane protrusions. Nanoscale stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy and the expression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, CNN1) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cyclic stretch was applied with 2.5% or 5% amplitudes. Attachment to biomaterials with a higher stiffness yielded more elongated MSCs with fewer membrane protrusions compared with biomaterials with a lower stiffness. For cyclic stretch, compacted collagen sheets were selected, which were associated with the most elongated MSC shape across all investigated biomaterials. As expected, cyclic stretch elongated MSCs during stretch. One hour after cessation of stretch, however, MSC shape was rounder again, suggesting loss of stretch-induced shape. Different shape descriptor values obtained by different stretch regimes correlated significantly with the expression levels of SMC marker genes. Values of approximately 0.4 for roundness and 3.4 for aspect ratio were critical for the highest expression levels of ACTA2 and CNN1. Thus, specific shape descriptor values, which can be generated using biomaterial-associated stiffness and tensile forces, can serve as a template for the induction of specific gene expression levels in MSC.

AB  - Total N-acetyl-aspartate + N-acetyl-aspartate?glutamate (NAA), total creatine (Cr) and total choline (Cho) proton MRS (1H?MRS) signals are often used as surrogate markers in diffuse neurological pathologies, but spatial coverage of this methodology is limited to 1%?65% of the brain. Here we wish to demonstrate that non-localized, whole-head (WH) 1H?MRS captures just the brain's contribution to the Cho and Cr signals, ignoring all other compartments. Towards this end, 27 young healthy adults (18 men, 9 women), 29.9 ± 8.5 years old, were recruited and underwent T1-weighted MRI for tissue segmentation, non-localizing, approximately 3 min WH 1H?MRS (TE/TR/TI = 5/10/940 ms) and 30 min 1H?MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (TE/TR = 35/2100 ms) in a 360 cm3 volume of interest (VOI) at the brain's center. The VOI absolute NAA, Cr and Cho concentrations, 7.7 ± 0.5, 5.5 ± 0.4 and 1.3 ± 0.2 mM, were all within 10% of the WH: 8.6 ± 1.1, 6.0 ± 1.0 and 1.3 ± 0.2 mM. The mean NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios in the WH were only slightly higher than the ?brain-only? VOI: 1.5 versus 1.4 (7%) and 6.6 versus 5.9 (11%); Cho/Cr were not different. The brain/WH volume ratio was 0.31 ± 0.03 (brain ≈ 30% of WH volume). Air-tissue susceptibility-driven local magnetic field changes going from the brain outwards showed sharp gradients of more than 100 Hz/cm (1 ppm/cm), explaining the skull's Cr and Cho signal losses through resonance shifts, line broadening and destructive interference. The similarity of non-localized WH and localized VOI NAA, Cr and Cho concentrations and their ratios suggests that their signals originate predominantly from the brain. Therefore, the fast, comprehensive WH-1H-MRS method may facilitate quantification of these metabolites, which are common surrogate markers in neurological disorders.
