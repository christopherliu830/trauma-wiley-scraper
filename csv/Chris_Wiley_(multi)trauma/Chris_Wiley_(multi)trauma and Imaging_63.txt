AB  - Abstract Controlling mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) shape is a novel method for investigating and directing MSC behaviour in vitro. it was hypothesized that specifigc MSC shapes can be generated by using stiffness-defined biomaterial surfaces and by applying cyclic tensile forces. Biomaterials used were thin and thick silicone sheets, fibronectin coating, and compacted collagen type I sheets. The MSC morphology was quantified by shape descriptors describing dimensions and membrane protrusions. Nanoscale stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy and the expression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, CNN1) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cyclic stretch was applied with 2.5% or 5% amplitudes. Attachment to biomaterials with a higher stiffness yielded more elongated MSCs with fewer membrane protrusions compared with biomaterials with a lower stiffness. For cyclic stretch, compacted collagen sheets were selected, which were associated with the most elongated MSC shape across all investigated biomaterials. As expected, cyclic stretch elongated MSCs during stretch. One hour after cessation of stretch, however, MSC shape was rounder again, suggesting loss of stretch-induced shape. Different shape descriptor values obtained by different stretch regimes correlated significantly with the expression levels of SMC marker genes. Values of approximately 0.4 for roundness and 3.4 for aspect ratio were critical for the highest expression levels of ACTA2 and CNN1. Thus, specific shape descriptor values, which can be generated using biomaterial-associated stiffness and tensile forces, can serve as a template for the induction of specific gene expression levels in MSC.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

AB  - Abstract Photogrammetry is a non-contact, high-accuracy, practical and cost-effective technique for a large number of medical applications. Lately, three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning and digital imaging technology have raised the importance of digital photogrammetry technology to a new height in craniofacial mapping. Under the support of the Eighth Malaysian Development Plan, the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment (MOSTE) Malaysia allocated a grant to establish procedures for the development of a national craniofacial spatial database to assist the medical profession to provide better health services to the public. To populate the database with normal and abnormal (malformation, diseased and trauma and burn victims) craniofacial information, it is necessary to evaluate the technology needed to capture the essential data of craniofacial features. The paper provides a discussion on the basic features of the spatial data and the data capture techniques. Both are needed for the establishment of a national spatial craniofacial database. The discussion includes a brief review of the current status of two selected high-accuracy craniofacial spatial data capture techniques, namely, digital photogrammetry and 3D laser scanning. The paper highlights a system which has been developed for a Malaysian craniofacial mapping project. Laboratory tests with mannequins showed that the photogrammetric and 3D laser scanning system could achieve an accuracy exceeding the design specification of ±0·7?mm (one standard deviation) for all the measured craniofacial distances. However, tests with two living subjects showed that the accuracy was in the order of ±1·2?mm because of facial movement during data capture.

AB  - Canine pancreatic tumours are rare compared to human medicine and the detection and differentiation of pancreatic neoplasia is challenging with B-mode ultrasonography, which often leads to late clinical diagnosis and poor prognosis. This case report describes the findings of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in four dogs with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or insulinoma. B-mode ultrasonography of the pancreas revealed a hypoechoic nodule in three dogs and heterogenous tissue in one dog. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to differentiate between two tumour types: adenocarcinomas showed hypoechoic and hypovascular lesions, whereas insulinomas showed uniformly hypervascular lesions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography findings were confirmed by cytology and/or histopathology. The results demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to establish different enhancement patterns between exocrine (adenocarcinoma) and endocrine (insulinoma) tumours in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Downstream passage of European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) in catchments with pump(s) for water level management is a major concern. Catchment-wide acoustic telemetry revealed silver eels quickly migrated downstream through unobstructed reaches (n = 12; mean ± SD = 17.9 ± 1.9 km/day). Fourteen of 17 acoustic-tagged eels detected at the pumping station (82.1%) retreated back upstream and ten (58.8%) passed through pumps after delays (9.5 ± 11.0 days). Multi-beam sonar imaging across the intake screen (55-mm gaps) revealed that peaks in migration occurred during the nights preceding the new moon but 76.7% retreated back upstream. All passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged eels recaptured (n = 56) downstream of a large (2.23-m diameter) mixed flow pump survived but 96.5% had minor injuries, reduced physical condition and/or abnormal behaviour. By contrast, 64.7% of PIT-tagged eels recaptured (n = 17) downstream of a small (0.8-m diameter) axial flow pump died. No acoustic-tagged eels that passed through the small axial flow pump (n = 10) performed onward migration at sea, unlike ?control? eels released downstream (n = 11). This evidence may help develop effective remediation measures, such as operational changes, to maximise escapement of catadromous eel species at pumping stations.

AB  - Abstract Cerebral white matter damage is not only a commonly reported consequence of healthy aging, but is also associated with cognitive decline and dementia. The aetiology of this damage is unclear; however, individuals with hypertension have a greater burden of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) on MR imaging than those without hypertension. It is therefore possible that elevated blood pressure (BP) impacts white matter tissue structure which in turn has a negative impact on cognition. However, little information exists about whether vascular health indexed by BP mediates the relationship between cognition and white matter tissue structure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the impact of vascular health on regional associations between white matter integrity and cognition in healthy older adults spanning the normotensive to moderate?severe hypertensive BP range (43?87 years; N = 128). We examined how white matter structure was associated with performance on tests of two cognitive domains, executive functioning (EF) and processing speed (PS), and how patterns of regional associations were modified by BP and WMSA. Multiple linear regression and structural equation models demonstrated associations between tissue structure, EF and PS in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital white matter regions. Radial diffusivity was more prominently associated with performance than axial diffusivity. BP only minimally influenced the relationship between white matter integrity, EF and PS. However, WMSA volume had a major impact on neurocognitive associations. This suggests that, although BP and WMSA are causally related, these differential metrics of vascular health may act via independent pathways to influence brain structure, EF and PS.

AB  - People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to extreme weather in unique ways. The entrenched inequalities that underpin disaster vulnerability are compounded by extreme isolation and the stress of transient living on mental and physical health. However, the impacts of extreme weather on the homeless in Australia are largely undocumented and rarely incorporated in emergency planning. Interviews with and surveys of emergency and homeless services and service users revealed that the primary ramifications of losing shelter and worsening mental health deepen the cycle of homelessness and trauma. Consequently, homeless shelter losses, such as tents, should be included in pre- and post-event impact statistics and subsequent recovery support. Extreme weather response plans should include early triggers and strategies for ?non-severe? weather events, as the homeless community is affected earlier and by a wider range of meteorological conditions. Moreover, this study also explores the benefits of a trauma-informed response to extreme weather when working with the homeless.

AB  - Abstract Azygos vein aneurysm is a rare disease. Surgical resection is usually performed when it ruptures. To avoid the thromboembolism, procedures that do not touch or push the aneurysm are recommended. Herein, we report a case of idiopathic azygos vein aneurysm. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for right lateral chest pain. Chest enhanced multi-detector CT revealed an azygos vein aneurysm in the posterior mediastinal space. No thrombus in the aneurysm was detected before surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to treat the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 4?days after surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was a good option to treat an azygos vein aneurysm, and an enhanced multi-detector CT was useful for performing surgery safely.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

AB  - Abstract??? Imaging plays an essential role in the evaluation of maxillofacial fractures both pre- and postoperatively. Several studies support the use of conventional two-dimensional imaging for traumas involving mainly the mandible, but for more complex situations advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging have higher indication. Nowadays, besides CT, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has appeared as a reasonable and reliable alternative considering radiation dosage, image quality and comfort for the patient. The purpose of this study was to review the fracture patterns involving the maxillofacial complex, provide a technical and practical comparison between CT and CBCT, and finally present the potential applications of CBCT illustrated with clinical examples.

Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass, and serum biochemistry and haematology revealed a mature neutrophilia, hypoalbuminaemia and a non-regenerative anaemia. Contrast radiography and abdominal ultrasound were suggestive of an intraluminal foreign body. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a surgical swab in the lumen of the jejunum that was associated with severe adhesions. Histopathology showed evidence of transmural migration of the swab from the peritoneal cavity to the lumen of the jejunum.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol dependence is associated with poor sleep quality, which has both been implicated with thalamocortical circuits function. To identify the possible roles of these circuits in the alcohol-sleep association, we investigated the volume of both left and right thalamus and corresponding resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences between 15 alcohol-dependent patients (AD) and 15 healthy controls (HC) male participants. The neuroimaging findings were then correlated with clinical variables, that is, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additionally, mediation analysis was carried out to test whether the thalamocortical RSFC mediates the relationship between drinking behavior and sleep impairments in AD when applicable. We observed a significant positive correlation between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. Compared with HC, AD showed reduced RSFC between the left thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right caudate. We also observed a negative correlation between RSFC of the left thalamus?mPFC and PSQI score in AD. More importantly, the left thalamus?mPFC RSFC strength mediated the relationship between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. No significant difference was detected in the normalized volume of both left and right thalamus, and volumes were not significantly correlated with clinical variables. Our results demonstrate that AD show abnormal interactions within thalamocortical circuits in association with drinking behaviors and sleep impairments. It is hoped that our study focusing on thalamocortical circuits could provide new information on potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment of sleep impairment in alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - The contrast in diffusion-weighted MR images is due to variations of diffusion properties within the examined specimen. Certain microstructural information on the underlying tissues can be inferred through quantitative analyses of the diffusion-sensitized MR signals. In the first part of the paper, we review two types of approach for characterizing diffusion MRI signals: Bloch's equations with diffusion terms, and statistical descriptions. Specifically, we discuss expansions in terms of cumulants and orthogonal basis functions, the confinement tensor formalism and tensor distribution models. Further insights into the tissue properties may be obtained by integrating diffusion MRI with other techniques, which is the subject of the second part of the paper. We review examples involving magnetic susceptibility, structural tensors, internal field gradients, transverse relaxation and functional MRI. Integrating information provided by other imaging modalities (MR based or otherwise) could be a key to improve our understanding of how diffusion MRI relates to physiology and biology.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The laparoscope has been invaluable in minimally invasive surgery, but provides only a surface view of target tissue; therefore it is lacking internal tissue information. In combination with the laparoscope for visualizing the cross-sectional view of the tissue, MRI is superior to ultrasonography or X-ray CT, because of its high soft-tissue contrast, arbitrary slice orientation and lack of radiation properties. Thus, we propose an integrated MR-laparoscopy system with a respiratory-synchronized navigation. Methods A transmit/receive RF coil for localized MR imaging with a 0.5 T open-MRI was mounted onto the tip of an MR-compatible laparoscope. The signal detection of the coil was examined with an excised porcine liver sample, an agar phantom and the abdominal wall of a healthy volunteer. A real-time navigation system to compensate for respiratory motion was developed, and examined with a healthy volunteer. Results The SNRs of the local MR images were 112, 62, and 62 in the liver sample, phantom, and volunteer. The navigation system successfully displayed the scope view, scope location and orientation, and MR images with respiratory-synchronized real time operation. Conclusions The MR-imaging and synchronization function of the proposed system seemed to be helpful for laparoscopic surgery.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with alcohol-dependent parents show an elevated risk of developing alcohol-related problems themselves. Modulations of the mesolimbic reward circuit have been postulated as a pre-existing marker of alcoholism. We tested whether a positive family history of alcoholism is correlated with ventral striatum functionality during a reward task. All participants performed a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task while their brain responses were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared 206 healthy adolescents (aged 13?15) who had any first- or second-degree relative with alcoholism to 206 matched controls with no biological relative with alcoholism. Reward anticipation as well as feedback of win recruited the ventral striatum in all participants, but adolescents with a positive family history of alcoholism did not differ from their matched peers. Also we did not find any correlation between family history density and reward anticipation or feedback of win. This finding of no differences did not change when we analyzed a subsample of 77 adolescents with at least one parent with alcohol use disorder and their matched controls. Because this result is in line with another study reporting no differences between children with alcohol-dependent parents and controls at young age, but contrasts with studies of older individuals, one might conclude that at younger age the effect of family history has not yet exerted its influence on the still developing mesolimbic reward circuit.

AB  - A 9-year-old, female neutered Dalmatian was evaluated for acute onset of dyspnoea. Thoracocentesis on presentation yielded 1300 ml sanguineous fluid, while thoracic radiology and ultrasonography showed a mixed-echoic cavitary cranial mediastinal mass, sternal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. Surgical exploration of the thorax revealed a multi-lobulated red/brown cranial mediastinal mass and multiple similarly coloured ovoid nodules within several lung lobes. Histopathology revealed thymic branchial cysts with neoplastic transformation and examination of the lung was consistent with metastasis. Despite initially recovering well, acute sepsis and pyothorax resulted in cardiac arrest 8 days postoperatively. This is the first veterinary report of neoplastic transformation of a thymic branchial cyst with pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To develop a reliable technique for diffusion imaging of the human spinal cord at 1.5 Tesla and to assess potential differences in diffusion anisotropy in cross-sectional images. Materials and Methods A single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with double spin-echo diffusion preparation was optimized regarding cerebrospinal fluid artifacts, effective resolution, and contrast-to-noise ratios. Eleven healthy volunteers participated in the study for quantitative characterization of diffusion anisotropy in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) by means of two diffusion encoding schemes: octahedral-six-directions for fractional anisotropy (FA) evaluation and orthogonal-three-directions for anisotropy index (AI) calculation. Results Pulse-trigger gated sequences with optimal matrix size (read ? phase = 64 ? 32) and b-value (700 s/mm2) allowed the acquisition of high-resolved images (voxel size = 0.9 ? 0.9 ? 5.0 mm3). The GM butterfly shape was recognizable in both AI and FA maps. Both encoding schemes yielded high diffusion anisotropy in dorsal WM (FA = 0.79 ± 0.07; AI = 0.39 ± 0.04). Lateral WM showed slightly lower anisotropy (FA = 0.69 ± 0.08; AI = 0.35 ± 0.03) than dorsal WM. Clearly smaller anisotropy was found in regions containing GM (FA = 0.45 ± 0.06; AI = 0.21 ± 0.05). Conclusion Diffusion anisotropy data of the spinal cord can be obtained in a clinical setting. Its application seems promising for the assessment of neurological disorders. J. Magn. Reson.
