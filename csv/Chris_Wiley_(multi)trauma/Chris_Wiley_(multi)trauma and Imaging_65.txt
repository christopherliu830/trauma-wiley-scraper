AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study evaluates trepanations from five well-contextualized prehistoric sites in the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru. The emergence of trepanation in this region coincides with the collapse of the Wari Empire, ca. ad 1000. Thirty-two individuals from Andahuaylas, AMS radiocarbon dated to the early Late Intermediate Period (ca. ad 1000?1250), were found to have 45 total trepanations. Various surgical techniques were being employed concurrently throughout the region. Scraping trepanations evinced the highest survival rate; circular grooving, drilling and boring, and linear cutting were far less successful. Evidence of perioperative procedures like hair shaving, poultice application, and possible cranioplasty use aimed to ensure the survival of a trepanation recipient. Postmortem trepanations, also present in Andahuaylas, were likely executed on corpses as a means of better understanding cranial anatomy and improving techniques. Similarities in trepanation patterns throughout the region attest to common motivations to engage in surgery. Although moderate physical head trauma seems to be the impetus for intervention in many cases of trepanation, other motivations included physiological and possibly psychosomatic factors. Nevertheless, treatment was not for everyone. In Andahuaylas, trepanations were withheld from subadults, females, and those individuals who practiced cranial modification.

AB  - An eight-year-old bull mastiff dog underwent a craniotomy for surgical excision of an olfactory lobe meningioma. Rapidly progressive neurological deficits with cervical pain developed within the early postoperative period. Intraventricular and cervical subarachnoid space air accumulation (pneumorrhachis) was identified through magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Repair of a dural defect using synthetic dura substitute resulted in gradual resolution of neurological signs attributable to the tension pneumocephalus and subarachnoid space pneumorrhachis. Regrowth of the meningioma was not observed. Postoperative intraventricular tension pneumocephalus and air accumulation within subarachnoid space are uncommon but life-threatening complications of intracranial surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a satisfactory outcome.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - Summary As an acute intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation/embolus injures the spinal cord to some degree, and may present as a traumatic incident, approach to diagnosis and management will be presented as an injury. Patients with spinal cord and vertebral injury or disease can exhibit myriad pain levels, in addition to frustration and anxiety. This anxiety and frustration can compound the pain level and pain scoring of a patient and should be taken into consideration. Before offering anti-anxiolytic medications, consider pain level and provide appropriate analgesia. Anesthesia-induced relaxation of the muscles that may be tensed to protect the injured area and inattentive handling of the patient during positioning for intubation, movement on/off gurneys, positioning for imaging/procedures can worsen the patient's pain and may even exacerbate the injury. Pathology may be due to ischemia, inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tumours or extradural compression resulting in persistent or intermittent somatic or visceral neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health issue that often causes enduring cognitive deficits, in particular memory dysfunction. The hippocampus, a structure crucial in learning and memory, is frequently damaged during TBI. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) is the leading cellular model underlying learning and memory, this study was undertaken to examine how injury affects area CA1 LTP in mice using lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). Brain slices derived from FPI animals demonstrated an inability to induce LTP in area CA1 7 days postinjury. However, area CA1 long-term depression could be induced in neurons 7 days postinjury, demonstrating that some forms of synaptic plasticity can still be elicited. Using a multidisciplined approach, potential mechanisms underlying the inability to induce and maintain area CA1 LTP were investigated. This study demonstrates that injury leads to significantly smaller N-methyl-D-aspartate potentials and glutamate-induced excitatory currents, increased dendritic spine size, and decreased expression of α-calcium calmodulin kinase II. These findings may underlie the injury-induced lack of LTP and thus, contribute to cognitive impairments often associated with TBI. Furthermore, these results provide attractive sites for potential therapeutic intervention directed toward alleviating the devastating consequences of human TBI. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5 ? 10?9, 10?8, 10?7 mol/L) of P4 or 10?6 mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9 mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7 mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6 mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9 mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7 mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool, particularly in patients with inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. In addition, continuous TEE has been used to monitor ventricular and valvular performance in the intensive care unit and the operating room. However, current generation transesophageal probes have limitations in the critical care setting due to their size. Recently, a prototype miniaturized transesophageal probe was developed to overcome these limitations. This probe was used by five medical centers for 194 examinations. A large proportion of these patients were in the intensive care unit (43%), as well as mechanically ventilated (39%). Seventy percent (70%) of the subjects in this study were intubated nasally with the prototype probe, with a success rate of 88.5%. Oral intubation was successful in every case. Subject tolerance was good, and 25% of the patients were intubated for > 1 h. Nasal intubation with the probe was more likely in intensive care patients, ventilated subjects, and patients who were intubated for > 1 hour. TEE with this miniaturized probe is feasible and safe even in multi-instrumented critical care patients. This probe provides adequate diagnostic imaging capabilities and may allow imaging over prolonged periods of time, making it suitable for the serial monitoring of ventricular performance.

AB  - Abstract In this article, a novel approach to schizophrenia classification using magnetic resonance images (MRI) is proposed. The presented method is based on dissimilarity-based classification techniques applied to morphological MRIs and diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Instead of working with features directly, pairwise dissimilarities between expert delineated regions of interest (ROIs) are considered as representations based on which learning and classification can be performed. Experiments are carried out on a set of 59 patients and 55 controls and several pairwise dissimilarity measurements are analyzed. We demonstrate that significant improvements can be obtained when combining over different ROIs and different dissimilarity measures. We show that combining ROIs using the dissimilarity-based representation, we achieve higher accuracies. The dissimilarity-based representation outperforms the feature-based representation in all cases. Best results are obtained by combining the two modalities. In summary, our contribution is threefold: (i) We introduce the usage of dissimilarity-based classification to schizophrenia detection and show that dissimilarity-based classification achieves better results than normal features, (ii) We use dissimilarity combination to achieve better accuracies when carefully selected ROIs and dissimilarity measures are considered, and (iii) We show that by combining multiple modalities we can achieve even better results. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of a piezoelectric instrument (PI) for bone removal during ventral slot surgery. Study Design Ex vivo feasibility study. Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

To investigate the mechanical characteristics of a nontoxic, low-cost, rigid polymer (RP) and to compare the structural and mechanical properties of a full-frame external skeletal fixator (ESF) with either RP connecting bars, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) connecting bars, or stainless-steel (SS) clamps and connecting bars. Study Design? In vitro mechanical evaluation. Methods? Mechanical properties were assessed using an in vitro bone fracture model with a bilateral uniplanar ESF (type II). Identical ESF were built with connecting bars using RP (n = 8), PMMA (n = 8), and SS connecting bars and clamps (System Meynard; n = 3). Nondestructive mechanical tests were performed in uniaxial compression (AC) and craniocaudal (CC) 4-point bending, as well as fatigue AC. Composite stiffness for each specimen and for each loading mode was calculated from 6 replicate measures using the slope of the load displacement curve at small displacements. Results? RP, PMMA, and SS ESF constructs yielded mean ± SD composite stiffness values of 227 ± 15, 381 ± 30, and 394 ± 9 N/mm in AC and of 35 ± 2, 24 ± 2, and 15 ± 0 N/mm in CC, respectively. Conclusions? Structural and mechanical properties of RP are satisfactorily rigid and fatigue resistant for its use as a connecting bar in ESF. Clinical Relevance? RP connecting bars in an ESF are a reliable, versatile, nontoxic and inexpensive option for the veterinary surgeon.

AB  - Summary A 27-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented for computed tomography (CT) of the head following a 3-month history of facial swelling at the infraorbital foramen, unilateral self-mutilation and head-shaking. Standing CT imaging showed soft tissue attenuation surrounding the infraorbital canal, with extensive bony lysis of the canal and maxillary bone at the infraorbital foramen. The mare was subjected to euthanasia, and post-mortem examination revealed a proliferative tan soft tissue mass overlying the infraorbital nerve. A histopathological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells was made. Immunohistochemical analysis failed to fully elucidate the mesenchymal cell of origin of the sarcoma. Pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells involving the infraorbital canal of the horse has not been previously described. This case highlights chronic subtle behavioural changes attributable to this neoplasm prior to the development of clinical signs and the utility of advanced imaging in the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract The periosteum serves as bone's bounding membrane, exhibits hallmarks of semipermeable epithelial barrier membranes, and contains mechanically sensitive progenitor cells capable of generating bone. The current paucity of data regarding the periosteum's permeability and bidirectional transport properties provided the impetus for the current study. In ovine femur and tibia samples, the periosteum's hydraulic permeability coefficient, k, was calculated using Darcy's Law and a custom-designed permeability tester to apply controlled, volumetric flow of phosphate-buffered saline through periosteum samples. Based on these data, ovine periosteum demonstrates mechanically responsive and directionally dependent (anisotropic) permeability properties. At baseline flow rates comparable to interstitial fluid flow (0.5?µL/s), permeability is low and does not exhibit anisotropy. In contrast, at high flow rates comparable to those prevailing during traumatic injury, femoral periosteum exhibits an order of magnitude higher permeability compared to baseline flow rates. In addition, at high flow rates permeability exhibits significant directional dependence, with permeability higher in the bone to muscle direction than vice versa. Furthermore, compared to periosteum in which the intrinsic tension (pre-stress) is maintained, free relaxation of the tibial periosteum after resection significantly increases its permeability in both flow directions. Hence, the structure and mechanical stress state of periosteum influences its role as bone's bounding membrane. During periods of homeostasis, periosteum may serve as a barrier membrane on the outer surface of bone, allowing for equal albeit low quiescent molecular communication between tissue compartments including bone and muscle. In contrast, increases in pressure and baseline flow rates within the periosteum resulting from injury, trauma, and/or disease may result in a significant increase in periosteum permeability and consequently in increased molecular communication between tissue compartments. Elucidation of the periosteum's permeability properties is key to understanding periosteal mechanobiology in bone health and healing, as well as to elucidate periosteum structure and function as a smart biomaterial that allows bidirectional and mechanically responsive fluid transport. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, expected outcomes, equipment, fluoroscopic procedure, special considerations, alternative uses, and the complication examples for pleural space disease. Pneumothorax and pleural effusions are common causes of respiratory distress in companion animals. A surgical approach is used for placement of the port associated with permanent pleural drainage and a basic surgical pack and sterile drapes are needed. Temporary drainage of the thoracic cavity can be easily achieved through the placement of an intra-thoracic catheter. Port placement is always performed with the patient under general anesthesia and controlled ventilation. Thoracic drainage catheters can also be used for infusion. Alternatively, cases of pyothorax, in which medical management is being pursued, may require thoracic lavage and drainage. The temporary thoracic drainage catheters can be used for this purpose; however, ports should not be used as they may become occluded or infected after suction.

AB  - Liver transplantation (LT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has been associated with a high rate of ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBSs) and inferior graft survival. To investigate the impact of an intraoperative tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on outcomes following DCD LT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of DCD LT at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and the Ochsner Medical Center (OMC). Between 2009 and 2013, 85 DCD LTs were performed with an intraoperative tPA injection (n?=?30 at TGH, n?=?55 at OMC), and they were compared with 33 DCD LTs without a tPA. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion requirement (3.2?±?3.4 versus 3.1?±?2.3 U, P?=?0.74). Overall, biliary strictures occurred less commonly in the tPA-treated group (16.5% versus 33.3%, P?=?0.07) with a much lower rate of diffuse intrahepatic strictures (3.5% versus 21.2%, P?=?0.005). After 1 and 3 years, the tPA group versus the non-tPA group had superior patient survival (97.6% versus 87.0% and 92.7% versus 79.7%, P?=?0.016) and graft survival (96.4% versus 69.7% and 90.2% versus 63.6%, P?<?0.001). In conclusion, a tPA injection into the hepatic artery during DCD LT reduces ITBSs and improves graft and patient survival without increasing the risk for bleeding.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study was carried out to determine the time and concentration profile required to achieve vancomycin-mediated eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. This information is critical for the identification of performance targets for local antibiotic delivery vehicles that target biofilm infections. S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms were grown for 7 days on titanium?aluminium?niobium discs in Mueller Hinton broth. After 7 days, the discs were then incubated in Mueller Hinton broth containing vancomycin at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000?mg/L. Biofilm eradication was assessed under both static and shaking conditions. Samples were retrieved at regular intervals for up to 28 days for quantification of residual biofilm. One additional disc was processed per time point for scanning electron microscopy. Progressive and significant reduction of viable bacteria was observed over time at all concentrations compared to unexposed controls. After 28 days under static conditions, the S. aureus biofilm was completely eradicated at 200?mg/L vancomycin and higher concentrations, but not at 100?mg/L. In contrast, bacterial biofilm could not be eradicated under shaking conditions at any concentration. Clinical significance: The present study shows that it is possible to eradicate mature S. aureus biofilm from metal implants by vancomycin alone although the time concentration profile required cannot be achieved by systemic administration or any of the local delivery vehicles currently available. Identifying targets for antibiotic delivery is the first step in developing fit for purpose local antibiotic delivery vehicles that will successfully and predictably treat established biofilm infection. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective.? To examine whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) are associated with an increased risk of migraine in the general population and to examine whether migraine is associated with an increase risk of MDE. Background.? Population-based cross-sectional studies have consistently reported an association between migraine and depression. However, longitudinal studies about this potentially bidirectional association are inconsistent. Methods.? This retrospective cohort study used 12 years of follow-up data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (15,254 respondents, age >12). Stratified analysis, logistic regression, and proportional hazard modeling were used to quantify the effect of migraine on subsequent MDE status and vice versa. Results.? After adjusting for sex, age, and other chronic health conditions, respondents with migraine were 60% more likely (HR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.9) to develop MDE compared with those without migraine. Similarly adjusting for sex and age, respondents with MDE were 40% more likely (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.9) to develop migraine compared with those without MDE. However, the latter association disappeared after adjustment for stress and childhood trauma. Conclusions.? The current study provides substantial evidence that migraine is associated with the later development of MDEs, but does not provide strong causal evidence of an association in the other direction. Environmental factors such as childhood trauma and stress may shape the expression of this bidirectional relationship; however, the precise underlying mechanisms are not yet known.
