AB  - Summary.? Introduction: Although the advent of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) has enabled better visualization of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) arteries, SSP embolism is of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed at answering the following questions: Is spiral CT an accurate method to detect SSP embolism? How are subsegmental perfusion defects managed in outcome studies including spiral CT? What are the main characteristics and outcomes of patients in whom CT detects isolated subsegmental defects? Methods: We performed a Medline search on July 1, 2004, using the keywords ?pulmonary embolism? and ?computed tomography?. We limited our search to English language prospective studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and to prospective outcome studies including CT in a diagnostic strategy, with at least a 3-month follow-up. Results: Fourteen studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and five prospective management studies using CT were retrieved. The sensitivity of single-detector CT for detecting subsegmental defects compared with pulmonary angiography was low (25%). The proportion of isolated SSP images was significantly higher in management studies using multi-detector CT (17 of 770 scans, 2.2%) compared with those using single-detector CT (22 of 2232, 1.0%; P?=?0.01). No straightforward attitude regarding anticoagulation therapy for isolated subsegmental defects emerged from the available literature. Finally, important clinical differences were found between patients having subsegmental and segmental or more proximal defects. Conclusions: These findings underline the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of SSP embolism, and the management of patients with such findings.

AB  - Abstract Arterial spin labeling (ASL) offers MRI measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo, and may offer clinical diagnostic utility in populations such as those with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we investigated the reliability and precision of a pseudo-continuous ASL (pcASL) sequence that was performed two or three times within one hour on eight young normal control subjects, and 14 elderly subjects including 11 with normal cognition, one with AD and two with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Six of these elderly subjects including one AD, two MCIs and three controls also received 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET) scans 2?h before their pcASL MR scan. The instrumental reliability of pcASL was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICCs were greater than 0.90 in pcASL global perfusion measurements for both the young and the elderly groups. The cross-modality perfusion imaging comparison yielded very good global and regional agreement in global gray matter and the posterior cingulate cortex. Significant negative correlation was found between age and the gray/white matter perfusion ratio (r?=??0.62, p?<?0.002). The AD and MCI patients showed the lowest gray/white matter perfusion ratio among all the subjects. The data suggest that pcASL provides a reliable whole brain CBF measurement in young and elderly adults whose results converge with those obtained with the traditional 15O-water PET perfusion imaging method. pcASL perfusion MRI offers an alternative method for non-invasive in vivo examination of early pathophysiological changes in AD.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the psychological effects of violence and disaster in both adults and children, although much remains to be understood. Siblings of children who have undergone such experiences have been little studied. Such siblings may be bereaved or may experience changes in family circumstances, or may develop psychological sequelae. They may be affected by legal procedures and media coverage. This new understanding of the needs of siblings may have implications for service development, including health and education.

The theoretical position of social dreaming and its historical development is described. Two examples are given for the practical application of social dreaming, a professional meeting of psychotherapists and an experiential workshop dealing with the aftermath of trauma. It is suggested that social dreaming is complementary to individual dreaming and offers insights and explanations, as well as guidance on various levels for applications in clinical, organizational, institutional and social settings.

AB  - Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) represent a widely used cell source with multi-lineage differentiation capacity in approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the multitude of literature on their differentiation capacity, little is reported about the physiological properties contributing to and controlling the process of lineage differentiation. Direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells via gap junctions has been shown to modulate differentiation processes in other cell types, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most abundant isoform of the gap junction-forming connexins. Thus, in the present study we focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in human ASCs, and its significance for adipogenic differentiation of these cells. Cx43 expression in ASCs was demonstrated histologically and on the gene and protein expression level, and was shown to be greatly positively influenced by cell seeding density. Functionality of gap junctions was proven by dye transfer analysis in growth medium. Adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was shown to be also distinctly elevated at higher cell seeding densities. Inhibition of GJIC by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) significantly compromised adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by histology, triglyceride quantification, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower proportion of cells undergoing adipogenesis when GJIC was inhibited, further indicating the importance of GJIC in the differentiation process. Altogether, this study demonstrates the impact of direct cell?cell communication via gap junctions on the adipogenic differentiation process of ASCs, and may contribute to further integrate direct intercellular crosstalk in rationales for tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To develop and compare an automated detection system for ischemic lesions in a neonatal model of bilateral carotid artery occlusion with hypoxia (BCAO-H) from T2 weighted MRI (T2WI) to the currently used ?gold standard? of manual segmentation. Materials and Methods: Forty-three P10 BCAO-H rat pups and 8 controls underwent T2WI at 1 day and 28 days. A computational imaging method, Hierarchical Region Splitting (HRS), was developed to automatically and rapidly detect and quantify 3D lesion and normal appearing brain matter (NABM) volumes. Results: HRS quantified lesion and NABM volumes within 15 s in comparison to 3 h for its manual counterpart, with a high correlation for injury (r2 = 0. 95; P = 8.6 ? 10?7) and NABM (r2 = 0. 92; P = 1.4 ? 10?22). Average lesion volumes for mild, moderate, and severe injuries were 3.85%, 28.85%, and 52.98% for HRS and 0.51%, 24.22%, and 48.74% for manual detection. Lesion volumes and locations were similar for both methods (sensitivity: 0.82, specificity: 0.86, and similarity: 1.47). Conclusion: HRS is an accurate, objective, and rapid method to quantify injury evolution in neonatal hypoxic ischemic injury models. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2011;33:772?781. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract One of the early concerns regarding the use of neuroscience data in criminal trials is that even if the brain images are ambiguous or inconclusive, they still might influence a jury in virtue of the fact that they appear easy to understand. By appearing visually simple, even though they are really statistically constructed maps with a host of assumptions built into them, a lay jury or a judge might take brain scans to be more reliable or relevant than they actually are. Should courts exclude brain scans for being more prejudicial than probative? Herein, we rehearse a brief history of brain scans admitted into criminal trials in the United States, then describe the results of a recent analysis of appellate court decisions that referenced 1 or more brain scans in the judicial decision. In particular, we aim to explain how courts use neuroscience imaging data: Do they interpret the data correctly? Does it seem that scans play an oversized role in judicial decision-making? And have they changed how criminal defendants are judged? It is our hope that in answering these questions, clinicians and defence attorneys will be able to make better informed decisions regarding about how to manage those incarcerated.

Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs with suspected primary renal lymphoma from 11 institutions. Results All dogs were substage b, and lethargy and gastrointestinal signs were common presenting complaints, as were azotaemia (n=25; 86%) and erythrocytosis (n=15; 51%) on biochemical testing. Ultrasonography typically revealed bilateral renal lesions (n=23; 79%), renomegaly (n=22; 76%) and abdominal lymphadenopathy (n=14; 48%). Chemotherapy was the only treatment in 23 dogs, of which 11 responded, all considered partial responses. For all dogs the median progression-free survival and median overall survival times were 10 days (range: 1 to 126) and 12?days (range: 1 to 212), respectively, and for dogs that responded to chemotherapy 41?days (range: 10 to 126) and 47?days (range: 10 to 212), respectively. Clinical Significance Primary renal lymphoma in dogs appears to be associated with a poor prognosis and short-lived response to chemotherapy.

AB  - Summary Ureteral obstructions are a major clinical problem in small animal veterinary patients most commonly associated with ureteroliths, ureteral strictures, and trigonal neoplasia of the ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). With the invasiveness and morbidity associated with traditional surgical treatments, interventional options have become the mainstay of treatment in the author's practice. The main treatment options discussed in this chapter are the use of nephrostomy tubes, ureteral stents, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices (SUB). Ureteral stenting is most commonly accomplished using endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in canine patients, and surgically-assisted with fluoroscopy in feline patients. These devices are used for a variety of obstructive disorders in both dogs and cats. The main type of ureteral stent used in veterinary medicine is an indwelling soft double pigtail ureteral stent that can remain in place for numerous months to years if necessary.

AB  - Abstract Sodium (23Na) MRI may provide unique information about the cellular and metabolic integrity of the brain. The quantification of tissue sodium concentration from 23Na images with nonzero echo time (TE) requires knowledge of tissue-specific parameters that influence the single-quantum sodium signal such as transverse (T2) relaxation times. We report the sodium (23Na) long component of the effective transverse relaxation time T values obtained at 7 T in several brain regions from six healthy volunteers. A two-point protocol based on a gradient-echo sequence optimized for the least error per given imaging time was used (TE1 = 12 ms; TE2 = 37 ms; averaged N1 = 5; N2 = 15 times; pulse repetition time = 130 ms). The results reveal that long T component of tissue sodium (mean ± standard deviation) varied between cerebrospinal fluid (54 ± 4 ms) and gray (28 ± 2 ms) and white (29 ± 2 ms) matter structures. The results also show that the long T component increases as a function of the main static field B0, indicating that correlation time of sodium ion motion is smaller than the time-scale defined by the Larmor frequency. These results are a prerequisite for the quantification of tissue sodium concentration from 23Na MRI scans with nonzero echo time, will contribute to the design of future measurements (such as triple-quantum imaging), and themselves may be of clinical utility.

AB  - Summary Treatment of the different types of equine sinusitis, in particular those of chronic (>2 months' duration) sinusitis can be difficult, with many such cases not responding to more conservative measures such as rest, antibiotic therapy or sinus lavage. Such refractory cases require further clinical examinations and imaging as outlined in a companion article to achieve confirmation of the cause of the sinusitis. Many sinusitis cases will then require some form of surgical treatment that may include sinusotomy, dental extraction or intrasinus growth removal, that are increasingly being performed by less invasive techniques under standing sedation.

However, these techniques lack the resolution to localize vital sperm or to reveal detailed morphological analysis of the oviduct which is often the cause of infertility in females. Therefore we set out to evaluate the efficiency of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic imaging tool for micron-scale visualization of the male and female genital tract. Using the bovine as a model, the optical features of the TelestoTM, GanymedeTM (both Thorlabs) and NirisTM (Imalux) OCT imaging systems were compared.

AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

AB  - Objective To determine whether the current Finnish screening method using a single flexed mediolateral view as scored by osteophyte is sufficient to diagnose mild elbow dysplasia in Labrador retrievers and to determine if an additional craniocaudal oblique projection would result in improvement in the screening protocol. Materials and Methods Thirteen dogs with one mildly affected elbow joint and one elbow joint without radiological evidence of osteophytes were studied. Radiographic and computed tomography studies were performed and the results compared with each other. Results Medial compartment disease was observed in 14 of 26 joints based on computed tomography. The sensitivity and specificity of the grading based mainly on osteoarthritis was 79 and 92%, respectively. A strong association existed between elbow dysplasia based on computed tomography and medial humeral epicondylar osteophytes on the craniocaudal projection. Clinical Significance A single mediolateral flexed radiograph is reliable in diagnosing mild elbow dysplasia in Labrador retrievers. However, the craniocaudal oblique projection increases the specificity of the diagnosis, and it is proposed that it be included in the radiographic protocol in this breed.

AB  - A four-year-old, entire male domestic cat was referred for assessment of a large abdominal mass of three-weeks duration. Diagnostic imaging suggested the presence of either splenic neoplasia, an abdominal abscess or haematoma. A coeliotomy was performed and an enlarged, irregular mass, including the left kidney and adrenal gland, was identified. The mass was removed, requiring a left adrenalo-uretero-nephrectomy. The aorta was accidentally punctured during the procedure, resulting in paraplegia. Given a poor prognosis, the owners decided to have the cat euthanased. Histological examination of the mass was characteristic of a chronic expanding haematoma.

AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium. (VUB/14-272-2). Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?The authors acknowledge Vtrade Belgium for the logistic assistance. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Summary Objective Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated acute white matter changes following prolonged febrile seizures (PFS), but their longer-term evolution is unknown. We investigated a population-based cohort to determine white matter diffusion properties 8 years after PFS. Methods We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and applied Tract-Based Spatial Statistics for voxel-wise comparison of white matter microstructure between 26 children with PFS and 27 age-matched healthy controls. Age, gender, handedness, and hippocampal volumes were entered as covariates for voxel-wise analysis. Results Mean duration between the episode of PFS and follow-up was 8.2 years (range 6.7?9.6). All children were neurologically normal, and had normal conventional neuroimaging. On voxel-wise analysis, compared to controls, the PFS group had (1) increased fractional anisotropy in early maturing central white matter tracts, (2) increased mean and axial diffusivity in several peripheral white matter tracts and late-maturing central white matter tracts, and (3) increased radial diffusivity in peripheral white matter tracts. None of the tracts had reduced fractional anisotropy or diffusivity indices in the PFS group. Significance In this homogeneous, population-based sample, we found increased fractional anisotropy in early maturing central white matter tracts and increased mean and axial diffusivity with/without increased radial diffusivity in several late-maturing peripheral white matter tracts 8 years post-PFS. We propose disruption in white matter maturation secondary to seizure-induced axonal injury, with subsequent neuroplasticity and microstructural reorganization as a plausible explanation.
