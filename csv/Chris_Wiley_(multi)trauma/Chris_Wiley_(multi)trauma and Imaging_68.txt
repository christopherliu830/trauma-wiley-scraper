AB  - Introduction The terminology for anorectal dysfunction in women has long been in need of a specific clinically-based Consensus Report. Methods This Report combines the input of members of the Standardization and Terminology Committees of two International Organizations, the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the International Continence Society (ICS), assisted on Committee by experts in their fields to form a Joint IUGA/ICS Working Group on Female Anorectal Terminology. Appropriate core clinical categories and sub classifications were developed to give an alphanumeric coding to each definition. An extensive process of twenty rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus). Results A Terminology Report for anorectal dysfunction, encompassing over 130 separate definitions, has been developed. It is clinically based with the most common diagnoses defined. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in female pelvic floor dysfunction. Female-specific anorectal investigations and imaging (ultrasound, radiology and MRI) has been included whilst appropriate figures have been included to supplement and help clarify the text. Interval review (5?10 years) is anticipated to keep the document updated and as widely acceptable as possible. Conclusion A consensus-based Terminology Report for female anorectal dysfunction terminology has been produced aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research.

AB  - Abstract Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death and disabling disease. Whereas risk factors are well known and constitute therapeutic targets, they are not useful for prediction of risk of future myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. Therefore, methods to identify atherosclerosis itself have been tested and found useful (ie, coronary calcium detection by computed tomography scanning, reduction in ankle-brachial index, and ultrasound scanning of the carotid arteries). This review will focus on the latter technique. Detection of thickened carotid intima-media by ultrasound has been used in many large epidemiological studies, but although it has been found to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death, its clinical utility is limited. Detection of carotid plaque has, on the other hand, been found to be associated with a substantial risk of future events. Similarly, detection of plaque in the femoral arteries is associated with increased risk, and plaque in the femoral as well as carotid arteries predicts even higher risk. Furthermore, quantification of plaque size (plaque area), such as quantification of amount of coronary calcium on computed tomography scanning, improves predictability?the larger the plaques, the higher the risk. So far, studies using ultrasound all have been performed with 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Recently, 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging has been introduced, which allows for more accurate quantification of atherosclerosis. Small studies pioneering its use have indicated the utility of measuring changes in vessel-wall volume and plaque volume with respect to treatment effect. The High-Risk Plaque Initiative BioImage Study is currently investigating the predictive value of total carotid plaque volume with respect to prediction of future cardiovascular events.

AB  - Objectives Adults with bipolar disorder (BD) display aberrant activation in fronto-limbic neural circuitry during cognitive control. However, fronto-limbic response to cognitive control, and factors destabilizing this circuitry, remain under-studied during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood in BD. Sleep patterns are disturbed in BD, undergo change in adolescence, and support brain function. Among transitional age youth, BD diagnosis and sleep (duration and variability) were tested as predictors of fronto-limbic response to a stressful cognitive control task. Methods Two groups of youth (13-22 years old) participated: 15 with BD type I, II or not otherwise specified (NOS) [BD; age 18.1 ± 2.7 years (mean ± standard deviation, SD); 17 female] and 25 healthy controls [CTL; age 19.4 ± 2.7 years (mean ± SD); 17 female]. Sleep was monitored with actigraphy for at least 1 week prior to an adaptive multi-source interference functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (a Stroop-like cognitive interference task). Group status and sleep duration (average and intra-individual variability) were examined as predictors of activation in response to incongruent>congruent trials within the bilateral amygdala, anterior cingulate (ACC), ventrolateral prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical regions of interest. Results The BD group displayed greater right amygdala activation than the CTL group. Average sleep duration and rostroventral ACC (rvACC) activity were negatively associated in the CTL group, but exhibited a quadratic relationship in the BD group such that short and long sleep were related to greater rvACC activation. Sleep duration variability and dorsal ACC activity were negatively associated in the BD group, and unrelated in the CTL group. Findings remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and mood symptoms. Conclusions Subjects with BD displayed a hyper-limbic response during cognitive control, and sleep was a source of variability in ACC engagement. Stabilizing sleep may be one avenue for improving cognitive control in BD.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To visualize the perforating arteries originating from basilar artery (BA) by using ultra-high resolution 7T MR angiography (MRA) and optimizing MR parameters as well as radio frequency (RF) coils, which may provide important information for neurosurgery and understanding diseases of the pons, but was unable to clearly visualize with conventional MRA techniques. Materials and Methods: Seven healthy volunteers (five males and two females, age [mean ± SD] = 28.71 ± 7.54 years) were scanned using optimized MR parameters to obtain images of pontine arteries (PAs) originating from the main trunk of BA. Two different volume coils and a phased array coil were designed and compared for this study. The images obtained at 7T MRA were compared with those at 1.5T and 3T MRA. Results: The results showed that PA imaging at 7T MRI consistently provided clearly identifiable vessels, which were difficult to visualize in MR angiograms obtained at 1.5T and 3T MRIs. Volume RF coils had higher sensitivity for the center of the brain, which enhanced PA imaging compared to phased array coil. The average number of PA branches in all seven subjects observable by 7T MRA was 7.14 ± 2.79, and the visualized PA branches were found to mainly propagating on the surface of the pons. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that ultra-high resolution 7T MRA could delineate the PAs using optimized imaging parameters and volume RF coils compared to commercially available 1.5T and 3T MRIs.

AB  - Summary The gold standard for the diagnosis of esophageal disease is esophagoscopy. This can aid in simultaneous diagnosis and treatment. The major risk associated with esophageal foreign body retrieval is esophageal perforation. This complication is uncommon but can be exacerbated by devitalized esophageal tissue, delayed intervention (chronic foreign bodies), bone foreign bodies, use of rigid instrumentation, pushing of foreign objects aborally, and excessive insufflation of the esophagus. Many tools exist for potential extraction of the foreign body, including endoscopic equipment, laparoscopic equipment, and balloon dilators. Proximal esophageal foreign bodies can be amendable to removal with rigid instrumentation in select cases, though this holds greater risk, as the instruments are not directed through the working channel of the endoscope. The prognosis following the removal of an esophageal foreign body is excellent. Complications following the procedure are uncommon and complete resolution f signs due to associated esophagitis are expected.

Materials and Methods The BORR pulse consists of two consecutive rectangular pulses with a phase difference of π. The exact solution of the Bloch equations was used to simulate its frequency response. The BORR pulse was implemented in a gradient echo sequence and tested on phantoms, the knee, and the breast. Results The frequency response of the BORR pulse acquired on the phantom confirmed the theory. Broad suppression bands ensured high suppression efficiency and robustness in both in vitro and in vivo scans compared with other saturation pulses. Conclusion The BORR pulse method provides a simple, efficient, and robust selective signal suppression alternative for three-dimensional short TR (repetition time) imaging. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the clinical characteristics, types of vascular ring anomalies (VRA), operative findings, complications, and survival after surgical treatment of cats with VRA. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional case series. Animals Client- or shelter-owned cats presenting to academic, referral veterinary institutions. Methods Medical records of cats with VRA that underwent surgical treatment were reviewed. Signalment, relevant medical history, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, complications, and survival were recorded. Results Twenty cats with VRA were included. Vascular ring anomalies were most commonly (75% [15/20]) diagnosed in cats less than 1?year old, with no breed or sex predilection. Regurgitation was the most common clinical sign, present in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. A persistent right aortic arch was diagnosed in 17 of 20 (85%) cats, with concurrent aberrant left subclavian artery in four of the cats. Surgical treatment was associated with survival to discharge in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. Persistent clinical signs were reported in nine of 13 (69%) cats, and radiographic evidence of megaesophagus persisted in four of 13 (31%) cats, with a median follow-up of 275?days after discharge. Conclusion Persistent right aortic arch was the most commonly diagnosed VRA in cats in this series, although multiple anomalies were observed. Surgical treatment of VRA in cats was associated with a high survival to discharge, although persistence of clinical signs and megaesophagus was noted in 69% and 31% of the cats, respectively. Clinical significance Surgical treatment of VRA in cats is associated with a high survival rate; however, persistence of clinical signs is an expected outcome.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - ABSTRACT The hippocampus is known to play a vital role in learning and memory and was demonstrated as an early imaging marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its role as a predictor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia following stroke is unclear. The main purpose of this study was to examine the associations between hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity (MD) and connectivity and cognitive state following stroke. Eighty three consecutive first ever mild to moderate stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors from our ongoing prospective TABASCO (Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans within 7 days of stroke onset. Hippocampal volume was measured from T1 weighted images, hippocampal mean diffusivity was calculated from diffusion tensor imaging and connectivity was calculated from resting state fMRI. Global cognitive assessments were evaluated during hospitalization and 6 and 12 months later using a computerized neuropsychological battery. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test which of the hippocampi measurements best predict cognitive state. All three imaging parameters were significantly correlated to each other (|r's| >0.3, P's?<?0.005), and with cognitive state 6 and 12 months after the event. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated the predictive role of hippocampal mean diffusivity (??=??0.382, P?=?0.026) on cognitive state, above and beyond that of volume and connectivity of this structure. To our knowledge, the combination of hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity and connectivity in first ever post stroke or TIA patients has not yet been considered in relation to cognitive state. The results demonstrate the predictive role of hippocampal mean diffusivity, suggesting that these changes may precede and contribute to volumetric and connectivity changes in the hippocampi, potentially serving as a marker for early identification of patients at risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder characterized by periods of elevated mood and depression. Many individuals with BD are initially misdiagnosed and treated for unipolar depression (UD). In this study, we report direct comparisons between medication-free individuals with BD and those with UD in terms of the neurometabolites in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), parietal cortex (PC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the brain. Methods Participants included medication-free patients with BD or UD, and matched healthy controls. All patients were in the depressive state and had similar symptoms. All subjects were subjected to a multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy procedure with a 3.0 T GE Signa MR scanner. After post-processing, the absolute concentrations of glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (GPC + PC), phosphocreatine + creatine (PCr + Cr), Glx (glutamate + glutamine), myo-inositol (MI), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) from the above brain regions were compared across the three groups. Results Patients with BD showed significantly higher levels of Glx in their ACC, lower GPC + PC, PCr + Cr, MI, and NAA in their PC, and lower NAA in their mPFC, compared to healthy controls; patients with UD presented significantly lower levels of GPC + PC, PCr + Cr, and NAA in their PCC, and lower Glx in their mPFC. All analyzed brain metabolites, except Glx, were significantly lower in the PC of patients with BD, whereas levels of GPC + PC, PCr + Cr, and NAA were significantly reduced in the PCC of patients with UD. Conclusions These results add to the evidence of brain metabolite differences in brains of patients with UD and BD which may be of help in differentiating these two mood disorders.

AB  - Summary Central venous obstruction can have profound systemic effects, particularly when venous return is affected. Interventional radiology techniques have been used to palliate both malignant and non-malignant causes of vascular obstruction for both intrinsic and extrinsic lesions. This chapter discusses the technical considerations for identifying and treating cases that might benefit from cardiac tumor obstruction interventions. All patients should receive a full physical examination and medical work-up prior to performing cardiac interventions. When performing anesthesia, intravenous catheter placement should take into consideration the location of the obstruction. Transatrial stenting from the inferior vena cava to the superior vena cava has been described for short-term management of ascites in two humans for intracardiac HCC extension. Heart base tumors such as chemodectomas can cause pulmonary artery compression leading to increased vascular resistance; a pulmonary artery stent has been placed in such situations resulting in reduced gradients.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, special considerations, equipment, procedure, and prognosis of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in dogs and cats, along with a few complication examples. PEG is often the preferred method of gastric tube placement because visibility is ideal and the procedure is fast, effective, and safe. Surgically placed gastrotomy tubes are generally elected when wound healing is in question or if a laparotomy is required. These tubes offer the benefit of creating an adhesion between the stomach and body wall, ensuring stoma formation and minimizing complication risk. A standard gastroduodenoscope is utilized to facilitate placement of the feeding tube. Placement of low profile tubes through the stoma differs with tube manufacturer. Some low profile tubes require an internal blunt stylet. This is typically a Malecot type of tube.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the clinical presentation, surgical treatment and outcomes of dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to intra-oral lancing and antibiotics. METHODS Medical records from January 2006 through September 2014 were reviewed and dogs with retrobulbar abscesses failing treatment with antibiotics and intra-oral lancing were included. Clinicopathologic, imaging and surgical details were extracted from the medical records. Referring veterinarians and owners were interviewed via telephone for follow-up data. RESULTS A total of six dogs were included in the study. The most common clinical signs were pain upon opening of the mouth, exophthalmos and prolapsed nictitans. Computed tomography was performed in five dogs, ultrasound in four and magnetic resonance imaging in one. Imaging identified an abscess in all dogs, with a suspected foreign body in four dogs. Surgical approach was a modified lateral orbitotomy in five dogs. No foreign body was identified during surgery in all dog. All dogs surviving to discharge did not have recurrence of clinical signs (follow-up time range: 27 to 95 months). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to standard therapy can experience long-term resolution of clinical signs with surgical treatment, most commonly via a modified lateral orbitotomy.

AB  - Objective Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling. Methods Fifty-six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates. Results Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (p <?0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10-fold cross-validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (p <?0.008). Interpretation This study provides the first multi-institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost-effective allocation of health care resources.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to illustrate the baseline appearance and enhancement patterns of splenic hemangiomas on contrast-enhanced sonography. Methods Two experienced radiologists retrospectively reviewed by consensus baseline and contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations of 27 patients (14 women and 13 men; mean age, 58.7 years) with 27 splenic hemangiomas (mean size, 2 cm) confirmed by splenectomy, biopsy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging and follow-up. Results On baseline sonography, 77.8% of the lesions showed a homogeneous echo texture that was mainly hyperechoic. Color Doppler imaging did not show any signal in 81.5% of the cases. After contrast agent injection, 59.2% of the splenic hemangiomas showed different degrees of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by isoenhancement in the late parenchymal phase. Among these, 2 hemangiomas showed peripheral globular enhancement in the arterial phase, followed by progressive centripetal fill-in. In 29.6% of the cases, some degree of contrast enhancement was appreciable, but the hemangiomas remained substantially hypoechoic throughout the contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations, whereas in 11.1%, the combination of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by wash-out in the late parenchymal phase was evident. Conclusions Isoechogenicity to spleen parenchyma in all phases is the most frequent typical enhancement pattern of splenic hemangiomas observed on contrast-enhanced sonography. Nevertheless, these lesions may show atypical contrast enhancement patterns; therefore, further assessment with cross-sectional techniques is needed.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, special considerations, and prognosis of gastric foreign body retrieval in dogs and cats, along with a few complication examples. Gastric foreign bodies are a common emergency in veterinary medicine and require appropriate case management for the most successful outcomes. A standard gastroduodenoscope is utilized to visualize the foreign body. A wide variety of instruments including baskets, nets, graspers, snares and forceps can be utilized for retrieval. Every endoscopic foreign body retrieval should include a duodenoscopy, as there could be an additional foreign body in the duodenum. The most frustrating aspect of gastric foreign body retrieval involves resistance that is encountered at the lower esophageal stricture (LES) that continually dislodges the foreign body from engagement. This can be minimized by selecting and instrument that complements the foreign body and provides the most rigid, firm grasp possible, minimizing slipping.

AB  - Objective In this trial, we compared the relative efficacy of dialogical exposure group treatment using Gestalt empty-chair method with a supportive group in the treatment of symptoms stemming from traumatic loss in a post-war society. Methods One-hundred and nineteen women whose husbands were either killed or registered as missing during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were quasi-randomized to seven sessions of group treatment with dialogical exposure or to an active control condition. Results Both interventions resulted in significant improvement from baseline to post-treatment for both kinds of loss, in terms of post-traumatic symptoms, general mental health and grief reactions, with the exception of depression and traumatic grief in the control condition. Regarding mean effect sizes (Cohen's d), pre-treatment to post-treatment improvements were moderate (d?=?0.56) for the dialogical exposure group and small (d?=?0.34) for the supportive group. Treatment gains were maintained at least until the 1-year follow-up. In controlled comparisons, dialogical exposure was superior concerning traumatic grief (Cohen's d?=?0.37) and post-traumatic avoidance (d?=?0.73) at post-treatment. Conclusions Results show that short-term dialogical exposure group treatment was moderately effective in treating traumatically bereaved women. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the ability to control the steering of a modified guidewire actuated by the magnetic force of a magnetic resonance imaging system with additional gradient coils for selective arterial catheterization in rabbits. Methods: Selective catheterizations of the right renal artery, left renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and iliac artery were performed on two rabbits. A 3D magnetic force was applied onto a magnetic bead placed at the tip of a guidewire. The ability of the guidewire to advance in the aorta without entering the side branches when the magnetic force was not applied was also evaluated. Steering of the guidewire was combined with a dedicated tracking system and its position was registered on the 3D model of a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Results: The magnetic catheterization of the renal arteries was successful and showed reproducibility. Superior mesenteric artery and iliac artery showed that the catheterization was feasible. These two arteries were difficult to visualize on MRA, making catheterization and setting the direction of the force more difficult. There was no inadvertent catheterization of side vessels when the guidewire was advanced with magnetic steering despite the hook shape at the tip of the guidewire caused by the alignment of the bead anisotropy with the permanent magnetic field. Conclusions: This first evaluation of selective catheterization of aortic branches with a magnetic guidewire provided a successful steering in the less angled side branches and this modified guidewire was advanced in the aorta without inadvertent selective catheterization when manipulated without magnetic actuation.

AB  - Objective To determine the vertebral heart size in chinchillas using right and left lateral radiographic views and CT images. To evaluate the agreement between radiographic and CT modalities. Methods Twenty-one clinically healthy chinchillas and seven chinchillas with cardiovascular abnormalities underwent cardiovascular examination before thoracic radiographs and thoracic CT obtained under dexmedetomidine-ketamine anaesthesia. Two observers calculated vertebral heart size for radiographic and CT studies. Reference intervals were calculated with the robust method. Agreement between radiographic and CT-derived vertebral heart size was evaluated with Bland?Altman plots and Deming regression. Results Mean ±sd vertebral heart size for lateral radiographs was 8·9 ±0·62 (reference interval: 7·5 to 10·2) and for CT-derived vertebral heart size was 8·2 ±0·55 (reference interval: 7·1 to 9·4). CT significantly underestimated the radiographic vertebral heart size by 0·66 vertebrae. There was no significant difference between vertebral heart size for right and left lateral radiographic views, or between female and male chinchillas. Clinical Significance Radiographic vertebral heart size for chinchillas is larger than that reported for similar rodents. Vertebral heart size can be calculated using radiography or CT in chinchillas, but these techniques are not interchangeable.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the equipment needed for the interventional endoscopy (IE) procedures. A C-arm fluoroscopy unit is ideal for most IE procedures. Lithotripsy is performed for stone removal. For larger stone burdens intracorporeal lithotripsy is recommended. This can be done using laser, electrohydraulic, ultrasonic, pneumatic, and/or intracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. The stents most commonly used in IE cases are either metallic or polyurethane. A subcutaneous ureteral bypass device (SUB) is currently placed with surgical-assistance under fluoroscopic guidance. Setting up an IE suite requires meticulous organization. When setting up for an IE procedure it is important that the operator has all the equipment necessary, the procedure is well thought out, and the room is appropriately organized. The operator should have more than one wire, catheter, needle, balloon, laser fiber, basket, available in the event one breaks, gets contaminated, or becomes difficult to use over time.
