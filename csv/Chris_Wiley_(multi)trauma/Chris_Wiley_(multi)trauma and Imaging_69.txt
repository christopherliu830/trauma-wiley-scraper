AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the equipment needed for the interventional endoscopy (IE) procedures. A C-arm fluoroscopy unit is ideal for most IE procedures. Lithotripsy is performed for stone removal. For larger stone burdens intracorporeal lithotripsy is recommended. This can be done using laser, electrohydraulic, ultrasonic, pneumatic, and/or intracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. The stents most commonly used in IE cases are either metallic or polyurethane. A subcutaneous ureteral bypass device (SUB) is currently placed with surgical-assistance under fluoroscopic guidance. Setting up an IE suite requires meticulous organization. When setting up for an IE procedure it is important that the operator has all the equipment necessary, the procedure is well thought out, and the room is appropriately organized. The operator should have more than one wire, catheter, needle, balloon, laser fiber, basket, available in the event one breaks, gets contaminated, or becomes difficult to use over time.

AB  - Abstract Because there are many potential risks in the MR environment and reports of adverse incidents involving patients, equipment and personnel, the need for a guidance document on MR safe practices emerged. Initially published in 2002, the ACR MR Safe Practices Guidelines established de facto industry standards for safe and responsible practices in clinical and research MR environments. As the MR industry changes the document is reviewed, modified and updated. The most recent version will reflect these changes. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013;37:501?530. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: While descriptions of the visible soft tissues of the femorotibial joints exist for both arthroscopy and ultrasonography, there are few examples in the literature that discuss in detail the combined findings of these modalities. Objectives: To further elucidate the ultrasonographic and arthroscopic boundaries of the normal equine femorotibial joints and improve the understanding of the benefits and limitations of each individual modality. Methods: Simultaneous arthroscopy and ultrasonography were performed in 10 equine cadaver stifles as well as bilateral stifles on a horse that underwent nonrecovery surgery. The arthroscopic probe was visualised ultrasonographically and concurrent video and still images acquired. Results: Arthroscopy provided good visualisation of the cranial meniscal ligaments, the distal portion of the cranial cruciate ligament, proximal portion of the medial collateral ligament within the fibrous tissue of the joint capsule and a limited view of the abaxial border of meniscus. Ultrasonography allowed for almost complete visualisation of the menisci, collateral ligaments and cranial meniscal ligaments and a portion of the cranial cruciate ligament. Conclusions: By comparing the ultrasonographically and arthroscopically visible structures, this study allowed for a more complete understanding of the advantages and limitations of each modality. The ability of ultrasonography to resolve mild pathological changes should be further explored. Potential relevance: When used together, these modalities can provide a more global image of the femorotibial joints.

AB  - This study presents the first in vivo longitudinal assessment of scar vasculature in ablative fractional laser treatment using optical coherence tomography (OCT). A method based on OCT speckle decorrelation was developed to visualize and quantify the scar vasculature over the treatment period. Through reliable co-location of the imaging field of view across multiple imaging sessions, and compensation for motion artifact, the study was able to track the same scar tissue over a period of several months, and quantify changes in the vasculature area density. The results show incidences of occlusion of individual vessels 3 days after the first treatment. The subsequent responses ?20 weeks after the initial treatment show differences between immature and mature scars. Image analysis showed a distinct decrease (25 ± 13%, mean ± standard deviation) and increase (19 ± 5%) of vasculature area density for the immature and mature scars, respectively. This study establishes the feasibility of OCT imaging for quantitative longitudinal monitoring of vasculature in scar treatment. En face optical coherence tomography vasculature images pre-treatment (top) and ?20 weeks after the first laser treatment (bottom) of a mature burn scar. Arrows mark the same vessel pattern.

AB  - Summary This report describes the unusual diagnosis of a retrobulbar syncytial meningioma in a 16-year-old Thoroughbred gelding. The horse initially presented with unilateral left sided exophthalmos and apparent blindness characterised by unilaterally absent menace and pupillary light responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a well-defined soft tissue mass intimately associated with the optic nerve. Based on the characteristic MRI appearance, a meningioma was suspected. The eye was enucleated under general anaesthesia and partial excision of the mass was achieved. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis and the horse underwent a course of adjuvant radiotherapy. Twelve months following surgery the horse is back in work, no neurological abnormalities have been detected and follow-up computed tomographic imaging of the skull has revealed mild bone sclerosis with no remnants of the mass identified.

AB  - Abstract Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a persistent or recurrent fever for which the underlying source has not been identified despite diagnostic investigation. In people, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) alone or in combination with computed tomography (CT) is often beneficial in detecting the source of fever when other diagnostics have failed. Veterinary reports describing use of these modalities in animals with fever of unknown origin are currently lacking. Aims of this retrospective case series were to describe 18F-FDG-PET or 18F-FDG-PET/CT findings in a group of dogs with fever of unknown origin. Dogs presenting to a single center between April 2012 and August 2015 were included. A total of four dogs met inclusion criteria and underwent either positron emission tomography (n = 2) or positron emission tomography/CT (n = 2) as a part of their diagnostic investigation. All subjects underwent extensive diagnostic testing prior to 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Initial diagnostic evaluation failed to identify either a cause of fever or an anatomic location of disease in these four dogs. In each dog, positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT was either able to localize or rule out the presence of focal lesion thereby allowing for directed sampling and/or informed disease treatment. Follow up 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed in two patients showed improvement of observed abnormalities (n = 1) or detected recurrence of disease allowing for repeated treatment before clinical signs recurred (n = 1). Fever resolved after specific treatment in each dog. Findings from the current study supported the use of positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT as adjunctive imaging modalities for diagnosis and gauging response to therapy in dogs with fever of unknown origin.

AB  - Summary Paragangliomas (phaeochromocytomas) can present with life-threatening catecholamine-induced crises: hypertensive crisis; atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; hypotensive crisis; and multi-organ crisis. Crises may be triggered by administration of drugs, such as dopamine antagonists, or anaesthetic agents. Manipulation of the tumour is likely to trigger a crisis in a patient without sufficient alpha-adrenergic blockade and exclusion of catecholamine excess is necessary prior to surgery on any tumour located at a site typical for paragangliomas. Dedicated cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) of the adrenal glands should be undertaken to localize the tumour. Alpha blockade using phenoxybenzamine at an initial dose of 10mg 12-hourly PO should be initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed. This carries a risk of inducing profound hypotension and is best undertaken as an inpatient. Beta blockade to control tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia may safely be commenced once adequate alpha blockade is in place.

AB  - The case study uses secondary information to examine the financial crisis that morphed into public health emergency in Flint, Michigan. While previous crisis management studies have examined financial crises and public health emergencies, the present study embodies both of them and offers an opportunity to understand how multi-level governments cooperate in responding to multiple emergencies. The overarching question of interest is how do local governments cooperate with multi-level governments to respond to multiple local emergencies? The specific research questions are as follows: (i) What are the causes, consequences, cautions, and coping strategies of the Flint crises; (ii) What are the roles of multi-level governments in responding to the Flint crises? and (iii) What are the indicators of success and failure in the response by multi-level governments to the Flint crises? The paper draws on the American federalism and crisis management scholarship for context and finds that crisis management leadership, effective communication, subsidiarity principles as in multi-level response, and accountability are necessary for effective response efforts that build resilient organizations. The findings corroborate previous studies making the present study generalizable to other emergencies. Local governments can learn from the Flint experience in mitigating the impact of crises.

AB  - Abstract Urinary diversion techniques are commonly required in the emergency room to correct life-threatening electrolyte and metabolic derangements resulting from urinary tract obstruction or leakage. These techniques may be permanent or temporary; temporary techniques are most often utilized in the ER to avoid long periods of anesthesia or sedation in critically ill animals as part of damage control surgical techniques. The most commonly used diversion technique is urethral catheterization. However, depending on the location of obstruction or trauma, other techniques such as cystostomy tubes or abdominal drainage catheters may be indicated. The implementation of interventional radiology in veterinary patients has also provided many alternative techniques within this setting.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Should Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms. Depression and Anxiety, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the frequency, types, and risk factors for acute perioperative adverse events (AEs) in dogs that had ventral slot decompression (VSD) for cervical intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Design Retrospective, case?control study. Animals Dogs (n?=?546) with cervical IVDD treated by VSD; 54 cases experiencing AE and 492 controls. Methods Historical, clinical, diagnostic, operative, and outcome data were collected. AE were graded using a Spine Adverse Events Severity (SAVES) system. Associations between the development of AE and hypothesized risk factors were analyzed using bi- and multi-variable analyses. Results AE were observed in 54 dogs (9.9%). Minor AE (SAVES Grade 1?2) occurred in 3.5% (19 dogs) and major (SAVES Grades 3?5) AE in 6.4% (35 dogs). Deterioration in neurologic status (n?=?13), persistent pain (12), and intraoperative hemorrhage (7) were common major AE. NSAID administration, surgeon experience, C7?T1 disc location, and intraoperative hypotension were significantly associated with AE in multivariate analyses. Improvement of AE occurred in 48/54 (88.9%) of cases, although reoperative neurosurgery was required in 48.5% (17/35) of dogs experiencing major AE. Dogs with major AE had significantly longer hospitalization and worse outcomes than dogs with minor AE or controls. No fatal AE occurred, although 0.7% (4/546) of dogs were euthanatized postoperatively. Conclusions AE occurred in 9.9% of dogs that had VSD, and were significantly associated with perioperative hypotension, C7?T1 disc extrusions, surgeon experience, and NSAID usage. Identification of a major postoperative AE is an indication for immediate diagnostic imaging studies, as 50% of dogs experiencing major AE required reoperation.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem. Ethical animal research:?Horse owners gave their consent for their animals to be included in the study. Sources of funding:?Institutional. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract This chapter articulates how research concerning brain development and brain trauma can help practitioners engage individuals in forensic work. A range of factors are important in shaping the structure and functioning of the brain -these include biological factors, genetics, and hormones. The chapter focuses on the practical ideas to help practitioners work with individuals who have been affected by neurological damage. Problems resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or substance misuse can also occur later in life and affect brain development. The chapter argues that treatment approaches with forensic populations should be informed by an understanding of how neurological problems can arise and affect cognitive functioning. It describes some of the deficits that are common within our client group, and consider the ramifications for treatment. The chapter provides a practical resource using accessible language, which will help practitioners work with forensic clients.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Abstract Shoulder injuries are a commonly presenting complaint to the ED. In the absence of an obvious deformity, they can be difficult to assess and definitively diagnose because of the multiple structures that cause shoulder pain, the acuity and severity of pain and the lack of range of motion in the ED setting. The quality of ED care provided to patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain is crucial to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common shoulder injuries and conditions in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines published in English-language in the past 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were considered for inclusion. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence. The search revealed 1902 articles, of which 73 were included in the review (n =?12 primary articles, n =?49 systematic reviews and n =?12 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians who manage shoulder dislocations, fractures and soft tissue injuries in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is strong evidence to support taking a thorough history and physical examination, with cautious use of special tests because of their poor diagnostic accuracy. Key points regarding the diagnosis and management of these injuries are provided.

AB  - Severe burn injury and cirrhosis often cause the translocation of bacterial endotoxins into blood, leading to systemic damage and even death. Our previous studies have shown that anti-lipopolysaccharide egg yolk antibody (anti-LPS IgY) can neutralize bacterial endotoxins in vitro and in vivo effectively, thereby reducing endotoxin damage. Whether anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal barrier and neutralize endotoxins in circulation remains unclear. In this study, we used in vivo small animal imaging techniques, protein purification, molecular biology, and mass spectrometry to show that intragastrically administered anti-LPS IgY is detected in the blood of mice as an intact molecule and has the capacity to bind to LPS. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that anti-LPS IgY is associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice. However, the route of absorption of this large protein molecule was not determined. This study suggests that anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the circulation, with the same molecular mass as purified anti-LPS IgY as a macromolecular protein, suggesting a new strategy for the prevention of damage caused by endotoxins.
