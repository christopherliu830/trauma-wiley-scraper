AB  - Severe burn injury and cirrhosis often cause the translocation of bacterial endotoxins into blood, leading to systemic damage and even death. Our previous studies have shown that anti-lipopolysaccharide egg yolk antibody (anti-LPS IgY) can neutralize bacterial endotoxins in vitro and in vivo effectively, thereby reducing endotoxin damage. Whether anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal barrier and neutralize endotoxins in circulation remains unclear. In this study, we used in vivo small animal imaging techniques, protein purification, molecular biology, and mass spectrometry to show that intragastrically administered anti-LPS IgY is detected in the blood of mice as an intact molecule and has the capacity to bind to LPS. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that anti-LPS IgY is associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice. However, the route of absorption of this large protein molecule was not determined. This study suggests that anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the circulation, with the same molecular mass as purified anti-LPS IgY as a macromolecular protein, suggesting a new strategy for the prevention of damage caused by endotoxins.

AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Summary Portosystemic shunts (PSS) are vascular anomalies connecting the portal and systemic venous systems that result in varying degrees of biochemical and clinical abnormalities. Unfortunately, due to diminished portal perfusion, only a minority of intrahepatic PSS (IHPSS) can be completely occluded acutely without resulting in life-threatening portal hypertension. More recently, endovascular management of portosystemic shunts has been described. These techniques can be used to provide partial or complete endovascular attenuation of IHPSS or extrahepatic PSS (EHPSS), achieve similar clinical results, and result in fewer perioperative complications and mortalities compared to those reported following traditional surgery. Portal hypertension occur uncommonly following percutaneous transvenous embolization (PTE), likely due to the post-sinusoidal location of the shunt attenuation favoring the development of intrahepatic venous collaterals over portal hypertension. Digital subtraction angiography is highly recommended when performing the PTE procedure.

AB  - Abstract There is increasing evidence that titanium ions are released from orthopedic implants by biocorrosion. The aim of this study was to investigate titanium uptake by human T-lymphocytes and its effects on phenotype and proliferation. Freshly isolated human nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NA-PBMC), were exposed to TiCl4 [Ti(IV)]. Bioavailability and distribution of Ti(IV) in T-lymphocytes was determined by energy-filtered electron microscopy (EFTEM). The effects of Ti(IV) challenge on nonactivated and PHA-activated cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers, RANK-L production, and proliferation assays. EFTEM colocalized Ti(IV) with phosphorus in the nucleus, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membranes, and the surface membrane of T-lymphocytes. Ti(IV) increased significantly the expression of CD69, CCR4, and RANK-L in a concentration-dependent manner. Titanium enters T-lymphocytes through a currently unknown mechanism and binds to phosphorus-rich cell structures. Titanium influences phenotype and function of T-lymphocytes, resulting in activation of a CD69+ and CCR4+ T-lymphocyte population and secretion of RANK-L. These results strongly suggest the involvement of titanium ions challenged T-lymphocytes in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. ? 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives: To review aetiology, clinical signs and outcome of cats surgically treated for septic peritonitis (2000-2007). Methods: A retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were the identification of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils and/or a positive culture from abdominal fluid and exploratory coeliotomy. Aetiology, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical parameters, surgical treatment and outcome were recorded and analysed. Results: Twenty-six cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain was reported in 10 (38 per cent) and vomiting was reported in 11 (42 per cent) of the cats. The most common aetiology was trauma (31 per cent). The principal source of contamination was the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperlactataemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia were reported in 9, 13 and 14 of the 26 cases, respectively. Non-survivors had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations than survivors (P=0·02). Nineteen cats were managed with primary closure, two with closed suction drains and three with open peritoneal drainage. Twelve (46 per cent) cats survived to discharge. Clinical Significance: In cats, lethargy, depression and anorexia were more common clinical signs than abdominal pain. Lactate level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful prognostic indicator in cats. The proportion of cats that survived was lower than previously reported and owners should be given a guarded prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic potential of a new dark fluid sequence, high intensity reduction (HIRE) in the diagnostic workup of patients with cerebral gliomas. The HIRE sequence utilizes a very long T2 value of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to suppress its high signal contribution in T2-weighted imaging by a image subtraction technique. Fifteen patients with histologically confirmed cerebral gliomas were examined with T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE), T1-weighted SE, fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and HIRE imaging using identical scan parameters. In patients with enhancing lesions, fast FLAIR and HIRE were added to the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted SE images. Images were analyzed in a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. In the qualitative analysis, lesion detection, lesion delineation, and differentiation between enhancing and non-enhancing tumor tissue were assessed in a two-reader study. For the quantitative analysis, lesion-to-background and lesion-to-CSF contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios were determined in a region of interest analysis. HIRE achieved a significant reduction of the CSF signal without losing the high gray-to-white matter contrast of T2-weighted sequences. In the quantitative analysis, the contrast ratios of the HIRE images were lower compared with the FLAIR images due to a relatively high background and CSF signal. After administration of contrast media, HIRE images presented a significant signal increase in enhancing lesions, which subsequently increased the contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios. In the qualitative analysis, both readers found all tumors clearly delineated on HIRE imaging. Compared with T2-weighted FSE, the tumor delineation with HIRE was better in nine patients, equal in four patients, and less in one patient. Compared with the FLAIR images, HIRE was rated superior in three patients, equal in nine patients, and inferior in another three patients. Delineation of the enhancing tumor parts was possible with HIRE in all patients. HIRE images had significantly fewer image artifacts than FLAIR images due to reduced inflow effects. The T2-based HIRE sequence presented is an alternative to the T1-based FLAIR sequence, with the advantage of better gray-to-white matter contrast and shorter measurement time. Due to the subtraction technique, signal intensities from tissues with relaxation times in the range T2 WM < < T2 < T2 CSF are also gradually affected, corresponding to their T2 values. With respect to this unwanted effect, an improvement in HIRE imaging will be possible by using a self-weighted subtraction algorithm. In a forthcoming study this concept will first be tested on appropriate phantom fluids. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2000;11:506?517. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Nonheart beating donation (NHBD) of the liver is a relatively new potential source of grafts. Guidelines to indications and contraindications to donation from controlled nonheart beating donors are still being formulated. We report a successful case of transplantation of a liver from a controlled nonheart beating donor who sustained significant injuries following a road traffic accident. Emergency laparotomy with peri-hepatic packing was performed to control haemorrhage from lacerations in segments VI and VII. Forceful packing resulted in an area of focal ischaemia in segment VI. Trauma to the liver should not be considered an absolute contraindication to controlled NHBD.

AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the association between the use of a flowchart incorporating Wells score, PERC rule and age-adjusted D-dimer and subsequent imaging and yield rates of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram and nuclear medicine ventilation perfusion scans being ordered in the ED for the assessment of pulmonary embolism. Methods A flowchart governing ED pulmonary embolism investigation was introduced across three EDs in Melbourne, Australia for a 12 month period. Comparison of pulmonary embolism imaging rates and yield with the preceding 12 months was performed. Results A total of 1815 pre-implementation scans were performed compared with 1116 scans post-implementation. Because of growth in patient attendances over this time, this equated to an imaging rate of 14.5 per 1000 presentations pre-implementation and 8.6 per 1000 presentations post-implementation (P < 0.001). Overall pulmonary embolism imaging yield rates rose from 9.9% to 16.5% (P < 0.001). A total of 179 pre-implementation pulmonary embolisms were identified, with an incidence of 1.4 per 1000 presentations. This compared to 184 pulmonary embolisms post-implementation, with an incidence of 1.4 per 1000 presentations (P = 0.994). Conclusion The introduction of a clinical flowchart incorporating Wells score, PERC rule and age-adjusted D-dimer was associated with an increase in ED computed tomography pulmonary angiogram and nuclear medicine ventilation perfusion yield rate from 9.9% to 16.5% across the three enrolment hospitals when investigating possible pulmonary embolism. This corresponded to a 40% relative reduction in pulmonary embolism imaging. Diagnosis rates remained unchanged and no cases of missed pulmonary embolism attributable to the flowchart were identified.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the complications and outcome after total prostatectomy in dogs with histologically confirmed prostatic carcinoma. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals 25 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing total prostatectomy were reviewed from 2004 to 2016. Data retrieved included signalment, presenting signs, preoperative clinical findings, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, surgical technique, histologic diagnosis, postoperative complications, occurrence of postoperative metastasis, and survival. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent total prostatectomy for prostatic carcinoma. Urinary anastomotic techniques included urethrourethral anastomosis in 14 dogs, cystourethral anastomosis in 9 dogs, ureterocolonic anastomosis in 1 dog, and anastomosis between the bladder neck and penile urethra in 1 dog. All dogs survived to discharge. Fifteen dogs were diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma, 8 dogs with prostatic adenocarcinoma, 1 with prostatic cystadenocarcinoma, and 1 with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Permanent postoperative urinary incontinence was present in 8 of 23 dogs. The median survival time was shorter in dogs with extracapsular tumor extension compared with those with intracapsular tumors. The overall median survival time was 231 days (range, 24-1255), with 1- and 2-year survival rates equal to 32% and 12%, respectively. Conclusion and Clinical Significance Total prostatectomy, combined with adjunct therapies, prolongs survival and lowers complication rates compared to previous reports of dogs with prostatic carcinoma. It should be noted, however, that case selection likely played a significant role in postoperative outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess intracochlear trauma using two different round window-related cochleostomy techniques in human temporal bones. Methods: Twenty-eight human temporal bones were included in this study. In 21 specimens, cochleostomies were initiated inferior to the round window (RW) annulus. In seven bones, cochleostomies were drilled anterior-inferior to the RW annulus. Limited cochlear implant electrode insertions were performed in 19 bones. In each specimen, promontory anatomy and cochleostomy drilling were photographically documented. Basal cochlear damage was assessed histologically and electrode insertion properties were documented in implanted bones. Results: All implanted specimens showed clear scala tympani electrode placements regardless of cochleostomy technique. All 21 inferior cochleostomies were atraumatic. Anterior-inferior cochleostomies resulted in various degrees of intracochlear trauma in all seven bones. Conclusion: For atraumatic opening of the scala tympani using a cochleostomy approach, initiation of drilling should proceed from inferior to the round window annulus, with gradual progression toward the undersurface of the lumen. While cochleostomies initiated anterior-inferior to the round window annulus resulted in scala tympani opening, many of these bones displayed varying degrees of intracochlear trauma that may result in hearing loss. When intracochlear drilling is avoided, the anterior bony margin of the cochleostomy remains a significant intracochlear impediment to in-line electrode insertion.

AB  - The identification and interpretation of brain damage resulting from a non-missile head injury is often not easy with the result that the most obvious structural damage identified postmortem may not be the most important in trying to establish clinico-pathological correlations. For example patients with a fracture of the skull, quite severe cerebral contusions or a large intracranial haematoma that is successfully treated can make an uneventful and complete recovery if no other types of brain damage are present. However, not infrequently more subtle forms of pathology are present and ones that can only be identified microscopically. A systematic and pragmatic approach through the autopsy is therefore required and one that recognises the need for tissue to be retained in ways that are appropriate for cellular and molecular studies.

AB  - A 20-month-old, female French bulldog was presented with a three-month history of generalised seizures and progressive ataxia with occasional falling over on either side. Neurological examination revealed signs, suggesting a multifocal intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two connected lesions on the left side of the caudal brainstem and a further lesion in the cerebrum. The dog was euthanased, and histopathological examination revealed lesions which closely resembled those of necrotising encephalitis in Yorkshire terriers. This is the first case describing this type of necrotising encephalitis in a French bulldog.

AB  - A five-year-old, entire, male dachshund was presented with a five day history of hypersalivation and regurgitation as well as polyuria and polydipsia for several months. Chest radiographs demonstrated megaoesophagus and aspiration pneumonia. Furthermore, hyperadrenocorticism was demonstrated by means of elevations in levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol, decreased urinary specific gravity, increased response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, insufficient suppression of the post-dexamethasone plasma cortisol levels, an increased endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration and bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands on abdominal ultrasound. The dog became severely dyspnoeic and was euthanased after magnetic resonance imaging was performed. The magnetic resonance imaging and necropsy revealed the sellar region mainly filled with fluid, with only small tissue remnants, a condition defined as empty sella syndrome in human medicine. To the author?s knowledge, this is the first dog described with empty sella syndrome and only the second dog described with hyperadrenocorticism secondary to ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production. However, the association between empty sella syndrome and hyperadrenocorticism may be no more than incidental.

AB  - Abstract The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a well-known source of low back and pelvic pain, of increasing interest for both conservative and surgical treatment. Alterations in the kinematics of the pelvis have been hypothesized as a major cause of SIJ-related pain. However, definitions of both the range and the extent of physiological movement are controversial, and there are no clear baseline data for pathological alterations. The present study combined a novel biomechanical setup allowing for physiological motion of the lumbosacral transition and pelvis without restricting the SIJ movement in vitro, combined with optical image correlation. Six fresh human pelvises (81 ± 10 years, three females, three males) were tested, with bodyweight-adapted loading applied to the fifth lumbar vertebra and both acetabula. Deformation at the lumbopelvises was determined computationally from three-dimensional image correlation data. Sacroiliac joint motion under the loading of 100% bodyweight primarily consisted of a z-axis rotation (0.16°) and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium (0.32 mm). Sacroiliac joint flexion-extension rotations were minute (< 0.02°). Corresponding movements of the SIJ were found at the lumbosacral transition, with an anterior translation of L5 relative to the sacrum of ?0.97 mm and an inferior translation of 0.11 mm, respectively. Moreover, a flexion of 1.82° was observed at the lumbosacral transition. Within the innominate bone and at the pubic symphysis, small complementary rotations were seen around a vertical axis, accounting for ?0.10° and 0.11°, respectively. Other motions were minute and accompanied by large interindividual variation. The present study provides evidence of different SIJ motions than reported previously when exerted by physiological loading. Sacroiliac joint kinematics were in the sub-degree and sub-millimeter range, in line with previous in vivo and in vitro findings, largely limited to the sagittal rotation and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium. This given physiological loading scenario underlines the relevance of the lumbosacral transition when considering the overall motion of the lumbopelvis, and how relatively little the other segments contribute to overall motion.
