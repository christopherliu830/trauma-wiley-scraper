AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the equine stifle is currently one of the most challenging anatomical locations on the horse to image. Limitations in scanner design and the unique anatomy of the horse have made imaging of this region difficult in the best of circumstances. Imaging of the stifle with MRI should be considered when a horse's lameness has been localized to the stifle. Disruption of the medial meniscus is readily visible with MRI. Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) is the most common irregularity identified to date in equine MRI of the stifle. This is much more readily visible on MRI compared with traditional radiography. MRI allows the accurate imaging of previously unidentified bone marrow oedema. Routine imaging techniques such as radiography and ultrasound are unable to identify this pathological process. Cartilage erosions and damage not related to OCD fragmentation is readily visible using MRI evaluation.

AB  - Objective To provide (1) a comprehensive description of hemipelvectomy; and (2) report clinical application and outcome of hemipelvectomy in dogs and cats. Study Design Descriptive report and retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?4) and 5 cats. Methods Cadaveric dissection was performed for imaging purposes using 4 mixed breed dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to this study. Medical records (2005?2012) were reviewed for dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy. Data collected included signalment, body weight, body condition score, clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging findings, location and extent of tumor, definitive diagnosis, use of adjuvant therapy, ability to ambulate postoperatively, complications, and survival. Results The most common indication for hemipelvectomy in cats was injection site sarcoma (ISS) and in dogs, osteosarcoma or peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST). Complete tumor excision was achieved in 6 (67%) cases. Incomplete excision occurred in 2 dogs with lumbosacral PNST and 1 cat having a 2nd surgery for ISS. Complications included intraoperative hemorrhage (n?=?2), postoperative soft tissue infection (2), and discharge from the incision site (1). All but 1 animal were ambulatory at the time of discharge. Hospitalization ranged from 1?10 days (median, 4 days). Survival after surgery was individually assessed. Conclusion With in-depth anatomic familiarity, hemipelvectomy can be successful for excision of neoplastic lesions of the proximal aspect of the pelvic limb, with only minor complications.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of 3D printing technologies lead to its new applications in the area of healthcare and medicine, including dentistry, orthopedics, cardiovascular, pharmaceutics, neurosurgery, engineered tissue models, medical devices, and anatomical models. Dentistry is widely acknowledged to benefit from 3D printing technologies due to its needs for the customization and personalization of dental products. In this review, the authors discuss and summarize various 3D imaging technologies and the recent advances of 3D digital processing techniques in dentistry in an effort to give a new perspective and greater understanding of the current development of 3D printing technologies in dentistry. It is anticipated that this review will explore why 3D printing is important to dentistry, and why dentistry motivates development in 3D printing applications. Further, current challenges and further perspectives are also discussed which helps researchers to optimize the 3D printing technology in dentistry, improve 3D printing strategies, and direct future dental bioprinting and translational applications.

AB  - Resilience is defined as a dynamic, multidimensional process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity. The complex nature of this construct makes it a difficult topic to study in neuroimaging research; however, in this article, we propose ways to operationalize resilience. The limited amount of structural and functional neuroimaging studies specifically designed to examine resilience have mainly focused on investigating alterations in regions of the brain involved in emotion and stress regulation circuitry. In the future, neuroimaging of resilience is expected to benefit from functional and structural connectivity approaches and the use of novel imaging task paradigms.

AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.

AB  - ABSTRACT Memory and related cognitive functions are progressively impaired in a subgroup of individuals experiencing childhood adversity and stress. However, it is not possible to identify vulnerable individuals early, a crucial step for intervention. In this study, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-hippocampal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were employed to examine for structural signatures of cognitive adolescent vulnerabilities in a rodent model of early-life adversity. These methods were complemented by neuroanatomical and functional assessments of hippocampal network integrity during adolescence, adulthood and middle-age. The high-resolution MRI identified selective loss of dorsal hippocampal volume, and intra-hippocampal DTI uncovered disruption of dendritic structure, consistent with disrupted local connectivity, already during late adolescence in adversity-experiencing rats. Memory deteriorated over time, and stunting of hippocampal dendritic trees was apparent on neuroanatomical analyses. Thus, disrupted hippocampal neuronal structure and connectivity, associated with cognitive impairments, are detectable via non-invasive imaging modalities in rats experiencing early-life adversity. These high-resolution imaging approaches may constitute promising tools for prediction and assessment of at-risk individuals in the clinic. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This study demonstrates the value of a fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) technique in the assessment of primary intraaxial brain tumors. Twenty-one patients with primary intraaxial brain tumors were examined by T2-weighted, proton-density-weighted fast spin echo, fast FLAIR, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo using identical slice parameters. The images were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria were tumor-to-background and tumor-to-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The qualitative evaluation was performed as a multi-reader analysis concerning lesion detection, lesion delineation, and image artifacts. In the qualitative evaluation, all readers found the fast FLAIR to be superior to fast spin echo in the exact delineation of intraaxial brain tumors (P < .001) and the delineation of enhancing and nonenhancing tumor parts. Fast FLAIR was superior in the delineation of cortically located and small lesions but was limited in lesions adjacent to the ventricles. Fast FLAIR provided a significantly better tumor-to-CSF contrast and tumor-to-CSF CNR (P < .001). The tumor-to-background contrast and tumor-to-background CNR of the fast FLAIR images were lower than those of T2-weighted spin-echo images but higher than those of proton-density-weighted spin-echo images. FLAIR images had more image artifacts influencing the image interpretation in only two patients. Signal hyperintensities at the ventricular border were present in 92% of the patients. They are common findings in fast FLAIR and should be included into the image interpretation.

AB  - Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, is now a widely used tool in pre-operative planning, surgical teaching and simulator training. However, 3D printing technology that produces models with accurate haptic feedback, biomechanics and visuals for the training surgeon is not currently available. Challenges and opportunities in creating such surgical models will be discussed in this review paper. Surgery requires proper tissue handling as well as knowledge of relevant anatomy. To prepare doctors properly, training models need to take into account the biomechanical properties of the anatomical structures that will be manipulated in any given operation. This review summarises and evaluates the current biomechanical literature as it relates to human tissues and correlates the impact of this knowledge on developing high fidelity 3D printed surgical training models. We conclude that, currently, a printer technology has not yet been developed which can replicate many of the critical qualities of human tissue. Advances in 3D printing technology will be required to allow the printing of multi-material products to achieve the mechanical properties required.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the accuracy of intestinal ultrasound for diagnosis of intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Inclusion criteria were dogs and cats with clinical signs suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction. Animals with no obstruction detected on ultrasound were excluded if they could not be monitored for 48 hours to confirm absence of obstruction. Sonographic diagnosis of small intestinal obstruction was based on identification of at least two findings suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Results: Ninety-two patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction were included. Correct diagnosis of intestinal obstruction was made in 21 cases (23%), and in 68 (74%) this diagnosis was excluded. Interpretation of the images on prospective analysis had sensitivity, positive predictive, specificity and negative predictive values of 100%, 87.5%, 95.8% and 100%, respectively. Clinical Significance: Ultrasonography is an excellent method for investigation of animals with gastrointestinal disorders, and is particularly useful for excluding obstructive processes.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study Distal deep digital flexor tendinopathy is an important cause of foot lameness in horses that is difficult to diagnose with radiography and ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. Objective To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. Study design Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. Methods Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. Results Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images. These 42 sites also had lesions on macroscopic evaluation. There were 3 false negative and 3 false positive results identified on CECT. The sensitivity of CECT for diagnosing lesions of the DDFT in the equine foot was 93%. Conclusion CECT is an effective adjunct to the more commonly used diagnostic techniques in equine foot pain.

AB  - Purpose Since Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data acquisition and processing are not standardized, substantial differences in DWI derived measures such as Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) may arise which are related to the acquisition or MRI processing method, but not to the sample under study. Quality assurance using a standardized test object, or phantom, is a key factor in standardizing DWI across scanners. Methods Current diffusion phantoms are either complex to use, not available in larger quantities, contain substances unwanted in a clinical environment, or are expensive. A diffusion phantom based on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution, together with a phantom holder, is presented and compared to existing diffusion phantoms for use in clinical DWI scans. An ADC vs. temperature calibration curve was obtained. Results ADC of the phantom (808 to 857 Â± 0.2 mm2/s) is in the same range as ADC values found in brain tissue. ADC measurements are highly reproducible across time with an intra-class correlation coefficient of > 0.8. ADC as function of temperature (in Kelvin) can be estimated as with a total uncertainty (95% confidence limit) of Â± 1.7%. Conclusion We present an isotropic diffusion MRI phantom, together with its temperature calibration curve, that is easy-to-use in a clinical environment, cost-effective, reproducible to produce, and that contains no harmful substances.

AB  - The objective of this work was to develop and validate algorithms for detection and classification of hypodense hepatic lesions, specifically cysts, hemangiomas, and metastases from CT scans in the portal venous phase of enhancement. Fifty-six CT sections from 51 patients were used as representative of common hypodense liver lesions, including 22 simple cysts, 11 hemangiomas, 22 metastases, and 1 image containing both a cyst and a hemangioma. The detection algorithm uses intensity-based histogram methods to find central lesions, followed by liver contour refinement to identify peripheral lesions. The classification algorithm operates on the focal lesions identified during detection, and includes shape-based segmentation, edge pixel weighting, and lesion texture filtering. Support vector machines are then used to perform a pair-wise lesion classification. For the detection algorithm, 80% lesion sensitivity was achieved at approximately 0.3 false positives (FP) per slice for central lesions, and 0.5 FP per slice for peripheral lesions, giving a total of 0.8 FP per section. For 90% sensitivity, the total number of FP rises to about 2.2 per section. The pair-wise classification yielded good discrimination between cysts and metastases (at 95% sensitivity for detection of metastases, only about 5% of cysts are incorrectly classified as metastases), perfect discrimination between hemangiomas and cysts, and was least accurate in discriminating between hemangiomas and metastases (at 90% sensitivity for detection of hemangiomas, about 28% of metastases were incorrectly classified as hemangiomas). Initial implementations of our algorithms are promising for automating liver lesion detection and classification.

Methods Descriptive analysis of previously collected images from 14 dogs and five cats. Results With the exception of shunts involving the right gastric vein, intrahepatic arborisation appeared similar on both modalities. Portovenography improved contrast enhancement and slightly enlarged the intrahepatic portal vasculature. Clinical Significance CT angiography cannot replace intraoperative mesenteric portovenography after temporary full ligation, which provides information on intrahepatic portal vascularity. It is a practical and dynamic procedure, providing results that are instantaneously available at the time of surgery. In addition, intraoperative post-temporary, full-ligation, mesenteric portography confirmed that the single shunting vessel had both been recognised and ligated.

AB  - Abstract Background: Early identification of an anomalous coronary anatomy is quite relevant because of the increased incidence of sudden cardiac death or related symptoms of myocardial ischemia in the patients. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is not only invasive, but expensive, and cannot always adequately provide the required information about the abnormal coronary anatomy. Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a robust noninvasive imaging modality that has several clinical applications and is now being used increasingly in practices across the nation. It not only provides high-resolution anatomical information of the coronary artery tree but also helps define other aspects of the cardiovascular anatomy, be it normal or abnormal. Hypothesis: This study sought to determine the clinical role played by CTA in the evaluation of different types of coronary arterial anomalies by reviewing CTA studies since 1997. Methods: We reviewed 6,089 case studies of contrast CTA conducted at our institution. There were 53 coronary anomalies in 39 patients (0.64%). Results: Computed tomographic angiography correctly identified the course of coronary arteries in all cases. Conclusion: The results of this study support the use of CTA as a safe and effective noninvasive imaging modality for defining coronary arterial anomalies in an appropriate clinical setting, providing detailed three-dimensional anatomic information that may be difficult to obtain with invasive angiography.

AB  - Objective: To determine response to treatment, survival and prognostic factors for feline extranodal lymphoma in the UK. Methods: Records of cats diagnosed with lymphoma of extranodal sites at seven referral centres were reviewed and information on signalment, tumour location, prior treatment and chemotherapy protocol recorded. Factors influencing response to treatment and survival were assessed. Results: One hundred and forty-nine cases met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine cats had nasal lymphoma, 35 renal, 15 central nervous system, 11 laryngeal and 19 miscellaneous locations. Sixty-six cats received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, 25 Wisconsin-Madison doxorubicin-containing multi-agent protocol, 10 prednisolone alone and nine other combinations. The response rate for the 110 treated cats was 85Â·5 per cent. Of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone treated cats 72Â·7 per cent achieved complete remission, median survival 239 days. Sixty-four per cent of Wisconsin-Madison treated cats achieved complete remission, median survival 563 days. Cats with nasal lymphoma achieving complete remission had the longest survival (749 days) and cats with central nervous system lymphoma the shortest (70 days). If complete remission was achieved, prior treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduced survival time. Clinical Significance: Cats with extranodal lymphoma respond to chemotherapy and achieve survival times comparable to other locations. Corticosteroid pretreatment reduced survival time in cats achieving complete remission.

AB  - The integrity of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) is critical to normal brain function. Traditional techniques for the assessment of BBB disruption rely heavily on the spatiotemporal analysis of extravasating contrast agents. However, such methods based on the leakage of relatively large molecules are not suitable for the detection of subtle BBB impairment or for the performance of repeated measurements in a short time frame. Quantification of the water exchange rate constant (WER) across the BBB using strictly intravascular contrast agents could provide a much more sensitive method for the quantification of the BBB integrity. To estimate WER, we have recently devised a powerful new method using a water exchange index (WEI) biomarker and demonstrated BBB disruption in an acute stroke model. Here, we confirm that WEI is sensitive to even very subtle changes in the integrity of the BBB caused by: (i) systemic hypercapnia and (ii) low doses of a hyperosmolar solution. In addition, we have examined the sensitivity and accuracy of WEI as a biomarker of WER using computer simulation. In particular, the dependence of the WEI?WER relation on changes in vascular blood volume, T1 relaxation of cellular magnetization and transcytolemmal water exchange was explored. Simulated WEI was found to vary linearly with WER for typically encountered exchange rate constants (1?4?Hz), regardless of the blood volume. However, for very high WER (>5?Hz), WEI became progressively more insensitive to increasing WER. The incorporation of transcytolemmal water exchange, using a three-compartment tissue model, helped to extend the linear WEI regime to slightly higher WER, but had no significant effect for most physiologically important WERs (WER?<?4?Hz). Variation in cellular T1 had no effect on WEI. Using both theoretical and experimental approaches, our study validates the utility of the WEI biomarker for the monitoring of BBB integrity.

AB  - Abstract Hemocompatible materials for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) technology are investigated to mitigate thrombotic complications associated with this therapy. A promising solution is an omniphobic bilayer coating, tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP), which utilizes an immobilized tether to anchor a mobile, liquid surface lubricant that prevents adhesion of blood components to the substrate. In this study, we investigated the effects of TLP on real-time clot formation using thromboelastography (TEG). TLP was applied to TEG cups, utilizing perfluorodecalin (PFD) or FluorLube63 as the liquid layer, and compared to uncoated cups. Human blood (n = 10) was added to cups; and TEG parameters (R, K, Î±-angle, MA, LY30, LY60) and adherent thrombus weight were assessed. TLP decreased clot amplification (Î±-angle), clot strength (MA), and adherent clot weight (p?<?.0001). These effects were greater with FluorLube63 versus PFD (Î±-angle p?<?.0001; MA p = .0019; clot weight p?<?.0001). Reaction time (R) was longer in TLP-coated cups versus control cups with liquid lubricant added (p = .0377). Percent fibrinolysis (LY30 and LY60) was greater in the TLP versus controls at LY30 (p?<?.0001), and in FluoroLube63 versus controls at LY60 (p = .0021). TLP significantly altered clot formation, exerting antithrombogenic effects. This reduction in surface thrombogenicity supports TLP as a candidate for improved biocompatibility of ECLS materials, pending further validation with exposure to shear stress.

AB  - Objective? To determine whether breed, sex, country of origin, and age are associated with anatomic location of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) in dogs. Study Design? Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Sample Population? Dogs (n=125) with IHPSS from the veterinary teaching hospitals of the University of Florida (21), Sydney University (44), and the University of California?Davis (60). Methods? Dogs with surgical/necropsy confirmation of single IHPSS were identified. Data were analyzed using logistic regression for associations between age, breed, sex, and country with the anatomic location of IHPSS. Results? Right (34%), left (34%), and central divisional IHPSS (32%) were prevalent with approximately equal frequency in Australia; in the United States, the prevalence of right (24%) and central divisional (26%) combined was similar to left divisional IHPSS (51%). Country (P=048), sex (P=.016), and Australian cattle dog ([ACD], P=.025) were significantly associated with IHPSS location. Dogs in Australia had 2.5-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Males and ACD had 2.8- and 5.6-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Australian dogs were significantly older than those in the United States (P<.0001) and ACD were significantly older than other breeds (P=.0067). Conclusions? Although country of origin, breed, and sex had significant associations with anatomic location of IHPSS, signalment does not appear to be a strong predictor of shunt location when used alone. Clinical Relevance? For the common breeds in this report, signalment is only occasionally helpful in predicting likelihood of anatomic division in IHPSS. Australian cattle dogs and male dogs have a statistical association with right (versus left) divisional IHPSS. If advanced imaging techniques are not available, veterinary surgeons should be prepared to locate and address any anatomic configuration of IHPSS in a dog.
