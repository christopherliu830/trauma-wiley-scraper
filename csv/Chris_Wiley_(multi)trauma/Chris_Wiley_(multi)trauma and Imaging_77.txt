AB  - Abstract Fractures are one of the most common large-organ, traumatic injuries in humans, and osteoporosis-related fractures are the fastest growing health care problem of aging. Elective orthopedic surgeries of the bones and joints also represent some of most common forms of elective surgeries performed. Optimal repair of skeletal tissues is necessary for successful outcomes of these many different orthopedic surgical treatments. Research focused on post-natal skeletal repair is therefore of immense clinical importance and of particular relevance in situations in which bone tissue healing is compromised due to the extent of tissue trauma or specific medical co-morbidities. Three commonly used murine surgical models of bone healing, closed fracture with intramedullary fixation, distraction osteogenesis (DO), and marrow ablation by reaming, are presented. The biological aspects of these models are contrasted and the types of research questions that may be addressed with these models are presented. ? 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Summary Pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical syndrome comprising sudden-onset severe headache accompanied by visual deficit, or extraocular muscle nerve palsy, or reduced conscious level. It may be misdiagnosed as meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Pituitary apoplexy results from haemorrhage into or infarction of a pre-existing pituitary tumour, and is almost invariably associated with hypopituitarism. A prior diagnosis of pituitary tumour is usually absent, with the apoplexy representing the first presentation of a previously unrecognized tumour in 80% of cases. Patients with pituitary apoplexy should, once stabilized, be transferred to a neurosurgical centre for the multidisciplinary management of an experienced pituitary surgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist and endocrinologist. Apoplexy may be precipitated by many factors; hypertension is the commonest. Conditions causing wide variations of blood pressure, including major surgery, are frequently implicated. Other known risk factors include head trauma, anticoagulant therapy or clotting disorders and pregnancy.

AB  - A four-year-old neutered male bichon frise was presented for the evaluation of chronic, progressive yet episodic neurological dysfunction that was predominantly cerebellar in nature. Diagnostic testing including haematology, serum chemistry, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and urine organic acid screening was normal. Trial therapies with phenobarbital, prednisone and acetazolamide were unsuccessful. Treatment with 4-aminopyridine led to complete resolution of the signs.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy for canine nasal tumours, including the improvement in clinical signs, rate of complications and assessment of prognostic factors. Methods Medical records of 38 dogs with malignant nasal tumours were reviewed, and those treated with a weekly schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy were included in the study. Acute and late side effects were defined as complications noted either within 1?month or after 6?months of irradiation, respectively. Progression-free interval and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan?Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were also performed. Results Clinical signs improved in 30 of 36 dogs. Acute complications were seen in 28 of 36 dogs and were considered manageable. Late complications were observed in 17 of 30 dogs that survived 6?months or longer, but severe side effects were not observed. The median progression-free interval and overall survival was 245?days (95% CI: 127?512?days) and 512?days (95% CI: 203?820?days), respectively. Age, breed and presence of dyspnoea were negatively correlated with overall survival. Clinical Significance These results suggest that hypofractionated radiotherapy could be a viable option for the treatment of nasal tumours in dogs that are not candidates for conventional multi-fractionated radiotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

AB  - Abstract In this report, we present the first regional quantitative analysis of age-related differences in the heritability of cortical thickness using anatomic MRI with a large pediatric sample of twins, twin siblings, and singletons (n = 600, mean age 11.1 years, range 5?19). Regions of primary sensory and motor cortex, which develop earlier, both phylogenetically and ontologically, show relatively greater genetic effects earlier in childhood. Later developing regions within the dorsal prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes conversely show increasingly prominent genetic effects with maturation. The observation that regions associated with complex cognitive processes such as language, tool use, and executive function are more heritable in adolescents than children is consistent with previous studies showing that IQ becomes increasingly heritable with maturity(Plomin et al. 1997: Psychol Sci 8:442?447). These results suggest that both the specific cortical region and the age of the population should be taken into account when using cortical thickness as an intermediate phenotype to link genes, environment, and behavior.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the abdominal and abdominal vascular injury. The presence of a seat belt sign (SBS) on the abdomen is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal injuries. In adult populations, the presence of an SBS increases the risk of intra-abdominal injury twofold to eightfold. An SBS may be even more concerning in pediatric patients where rates of intra-abdominal injury can be increased as much as twelvefold. Damage-control surgery (DCS) has been applied to many surgical conditions including nontraumatic abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. For the trauma patient in extremis with noncompressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is gaining popularity as an alternative to resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic clamping. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect many body systems including neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and genitourinary.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have suggested that heroin addiction is associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities. However, it is largely unknown whether these characteristics of brain abnormalities would be persistent or restored after long periods of abstinence. Considering the very high rates of relapse, we hypothesized that there may exist some latent neural vulnerabilities in abstinent heroin users. In this study, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 30 former heroin-dependent (FHD) subjects who were drug free for more than 3 years and 30 non-addicted control (CN) volunteers. Voxel-based morphometry was used to identify possible gray matter volume differences between the FHD and CN groups. Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in FHD were examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. Significantly reduced gray matter volume was observed in FHD in an area surrounding the parieto-occipital sulcus, which included the precuneus and cuneus. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that the FHD subjects showed reduced positive correlation within the default mode network and visual network and decreased negative correlation between the default mode network, visual network and task positive network. Moreover, the altered functional connectivity was correlated with self-reported impulsivity scores in the FHD subjects. Our findings suggest that disruption of large-scale brain systems is present in former heroin users even after multi-year abstinence, which could serve as system-level neural underpinnings for behavioral dysfunctions associated with addiction.

AB  - Abstract The Anger camera (also known as the gamma camera or scintillation camera) was invented by Hal O. Anger in 1957 and it is still the primary imaging instrument used in nuclear medicine. Although there have been many improvements in this device resulting from better components, advanced electronics, and digital implementations, the fundamental operation of the Anger camera has not changed. The Anger camera uses one large, thin sodium iodide crystal for absorbing gamma-ray energy and converting that energy into visible light. The light signals are sampled by an array of photomultilier tubes that determine X and Y locations and the energy of detected events. When a signal from a detected event falls within a preselected energy range, the X and Y locations are recorded in either list or histogram modes. The Anger camera uses multiholed lead collimators as the image-forming aperture. Anger cameras are used for a wide range of radionuclide imaging including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as conventional nuclear medicine studies.

AB  - Abstract This chapter discusses the key elements of the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management, radio-therapeutic techniques, and radiotherapy disease control and toxicity outcomes of men with prostate cancer in the modern era. It highlights the recent updates and advances in the screening, diagnosis, radiographic imaging, and treatment of men with prostate cancer with a focus on the radiotherapeutic approaches. Currently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening remains one of the most controversial aspects of prostate cancer diagnosis and management. Patients with low-risk prostate cancer are candidates for nearly all of the treatment approaches. Active surveillance should also be considered and discussed with patients in this group, who can receive local treatment with radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Several radiation modalities exist for the definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer, including external beam radiation with high-energy x-rays or particles, as well as low-dose rate (LDR) and high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.

Methods: Eleven LGMD2A, 9 LGMD2B patients and 11 healthy controls underwent a multi-parametric 3T MRI examination of the thigh. The protocol included structural T1-weighted images, DIXON sequences for fat fraction calculation, T2 values quantification and diffusion MRI. Region of interest analysis was performed on 4 different compartments (anterior compartment, posterior compartment, gracilis, sartorius). Results: Patients showed high levels of fat infiltration as measured by DIXON sequences. Sartorius and anterior compartment were more infiltrated in LGMD2B than LGMD2A patients. T2 values were mildly reduced in both disorders. Correlations between clinical scores and qMRI were found. Conclusions: qMRI measures may help to quantify muscular degeneration, but careful interpretation is needed when fat infiltration is massive. Muscle Nerve 58: 550?558, 2018

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the utility of capsule endoscopy to detect mucosal abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. METHODS Capsules were administered to 2 healthy controls and 8 patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Images were evaluated for quality, gastric emptying time, small intestinal transit time and presence of lesions. RESULTS There were no adverse effects of capsule endoscopy in dogs weighing from 7·7 to 58 kg. The capsule traversed the entire gastrointestinal tract in 5 of 8 patients, with high quality images obtained in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric emptying time and small intestinal transit time ranged from 1 to 270 and 15 to 180 minutes, respectively. In 3 of 8 patients, the capsule remained in the stomach despite pro-kinetics. Gastric lesions included mild haemorrhage and pinpoint erosion (4 of 8), a mass (1) and thickened bleeding pyloric mucosa (2). Two of 3 dogs with capsule retention had gastric lesions. Intestinal lesions included a healing duodenal ulcer, abnormal villi, ileal ulceration and colonic bleeding. Lesions identified by capsule endoscopy were considered a significant source of haemorrhage in 4 of 7 dogs with active bleeding. The relevance of pinpoint gastric mucosal erosions to blood loss is unclear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Capsule endoscopy can enable the non-invasive detection of gastric and small intestinal mucosal lesions in dogs presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Summary Background Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is a rare cause of lameness in the adult horse, and a haematogenous pathogenesis has been proposed in previous cases. Objectives To describe the features and outcome of synovial sepsis of unknown origin in adult Thoroughbred racehorses. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Hospital records for admissions between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed to identify adult horses diagnosed with synovial sepsis of unknown origin. Presentation, clinicopathological, microbiological and diagnostic imaging findings were recorded. Treatment methods, surgical findings, complications and long-term outcome were evaluated. Results Eleven cases were identified over the study period. Diagnosis was established from clinical examination and clinicopathologic findings, which were comparable to other aetiologies of synovial sepsis. Affected structures included synovial joints, tendon sheaths and bursae. Concurrent osteochondritis dissecans or articular cartilage lesions were evident during arthroscopic surgery in three cases. Significant intrasynovial haemorrhage was not identified. Microbial culture of synovial fluid or synovial biopsy was positive in 6/11 of cases, with all isolates being Gram-positive cocci. Of the 6 positive microbial cultures, all isolates demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to a cephalosporin antimicrobial agent. A concurrent remote wound was present in a single case. No other potential origins of bacteraemia were identified. Treatment methods included endoscopic surgery, standing multineedle lavage, intravenous regional limb perfusion, intrasynovial medication and/or systemic antimicrobial administration. All horses survived to hospital discharge. For the 6/11 cases that raced following synovial sepsis, the median period for return to racing was 221 days. Main limitations A small study population, which was retrospectively reviewed. Conclusions Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is rare in the adult Thoroughbred racehorse and can affect a range of synovial structures. A concurrent potential source of bacteraemia is rarely identified. With appropriate management, the prognosis to return to racing is fair.

AB  - Abstract Mangafodipir, a manganese-containing hepatobiliary contrast agent, is excreted in bile. We review the principles and practice of a contrast-enhanced MRC technique using mangafodipir and compare it with standard T2-weighted magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) sequences. Potential applications include the evaluation of leaks and strictures; the assessment of drainage in normal, surgically by-passed, stented and obstructed biliary systems; the diagnosis of cholecystitis; and the evaluation of normal and variant biliary anatomy.
