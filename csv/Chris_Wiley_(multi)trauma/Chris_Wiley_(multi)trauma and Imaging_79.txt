AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

AB  - Steroid responsive meningitis-arteriitis (SRMA) is an immunemediated disorder commonly recognised in dogs in small animal practice. Two different forms of SRMA may occur. The typical, acute form of SRMA is characterised by cervical rigidity, pain, pyrexia and a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a less common, chronic form of SRMA, additional neurological deficits consistent with a spinal cord or a multi-focal neurological disorder may be present, often accompanied by a mononuclear CSF pleocytosis. The prognosis for young dogs in the acute stage of SRMA is relatively good with early and aggressive anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. In more protracted, relapsing cases of SRMA the prognosis is guarded, and therapy requires more aggressive, long term immunosuppression. The complete etiopathogenesis of SRMA is unknown; however, an aberrant immune response directed against the central nervous system (CNS) is most likely. Neutrophilic pleocytosis in SRMA seems to be facilitated by chemotactic factors in the CSF and upregulation of integrins and metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood brain barrier. Upregulation of IgA, induced by a Th2 immune response, also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of SRMA.

AB  - Purpose To report a rare complicated case of eye injury with endophthalmitis, an air bubble (bacteria-produced), retinal detachment, and traumatic cataract, treated surgically with excellent functional outcome. Methods Retrospective analysis of the hard and electronic notes, CT images, OCT images and operation notes. Results 28 year old male presented 5 days post penetrating injury to right eye, with retained metal foreign body. A gas bubble demonstrated on CT in the right superior globe ? believed to be bacteria produced. Multi-stage surgical approach used to treat endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, cataract and removal of FB. Post-operative outcomes: vision of 6/12 on the affected site, with flat retina, no inflammation and minimal CMO. Conclusions Favourable outcomes are possible with carefully planned and prioritised multi-stage surgical approach, even in complicated cases with late presentation; described approach may help to optimise outcomes in similar eye trauma presentations.

AB  - With its emphasis on minimally invasive high-speed imaging of intact tissues at depth, video-rate two-photon microscopy has revolutionized cell biology. This is particularly true in immunology, where the orchestration of cell migration, cell?cell interactions and intracellular signalling events in multiple distinct anatomical compartments within secondary lymphoid organs is fundamental for achieving an effective immune response. Until recently, access to this powerful tool has been limited to a handful of laboratories with the necessary skills and resources to either custom-build or purchase a commercial two-photon microscope. However, with the entry of more commercial vendors into the market and availability of turnkey solutions, two-photon microscopy is now becoming more accessible. Here, we discuss the practical aspects of establishing a basic intravital two-photon microscopy facility specifically for immunological research and how recent advances in ultrafast lasers, non-linear optics and localized photochemistry can be used to build more sophisticated instruments to support applications such as photoactivation and photobleaching, spectral fingerprinting and automated single-cell tracking. In addition, we discuss the next generation of fluorescent dyes and reporter mice and some of the microsurgical principles required to expose the relevant biology to interrogation by two-photon excitation.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses only a subset of the many fascinating topics that link memory development and law. It reviews core basic memory development principles that are important in the legal context. The chapter focuses on distress, trauma and memory, a topic of vital concern given the types of cases that come to the attention of police officers, child protection workers, child forensic interviewers, and the courts. It reviews some of the prominent research on children's non-disclosure of crime, particularly of child sexual abuse. The chapter considers memory development not only as influenced by cognitive factors but by social factors as well, since the latter can profoundly affect children's memory reports within the legal context. It ends with addressing, in some detail, child forensic interview protocols that have been developed based in large part on scientific research on children's eyewitness memory.

AB  - Abstract Background?Studies of the relationship between alcohol and violent injury confirm that while there is some evidence of a direct pharmacological association, many other factors are relevant to the frequency and severity of both violent perpetration and being a victim of violence. It is now widely recognized that official police statistics are a poor indicator of the nature and extent of public violence. Aims?Accident and emergency departments and trauma surgeons are not only in a position to provide more accurate information on the nature and extent of clinically significant injury, but they can contribute substantially to violence prevention. This can be achieved through individually targeted interventions in conjunction with other clinicians on the one hand, and on the other through public health and community initiatives, in conjunction with other community agencies, including the police and local authorities. This article describes some of those initiatives and the evidence underpinning them. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary We report the successful use of a stellate ganglion block as part of a multi-modal postoperative analgesic regimen. Four patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery following upper limb trauma underwent blockade of the stellate ganglion pre-operatively under ultrasound guidance. Patients reported excellent postoperative analgesia, with postoperative VAS pain scores between 0 and 2, and consumption of morphine in the first 24 h ranging from 0 to 14?mg. While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a clinical trial, they highlight the potential for stellate ganglion blockade to provide analgesia following major upper limb surgery.

AB  - Objective To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. Methods Cognitive and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged?≥?65 years (n?=?23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n?=?69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n?=?23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio?≥?1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios?=?0.95?±?0.15, 1.11?±?0.18 [p?<?0.0001], and 1.14?±?0.17 [p?=?0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74?83.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in using high-resolution micro-tomography to investigate the morphology of neurovascular networks in the central nervous system, which remain difficult to characterize due to their microscopic size as well as their delicate and complex 3D structure. Synchrotron radiation X-ray imaging, which has emerged as a cutting-edge imaging technology with a high spatial resolution, provides a novel platform for the non-destructive imaging of microvasculature networks at a sub-micrometre scale. When coupled with computed tomography, this technique allows the characterization of the 3D morphology of vasculature. The current review focuses on recent progress in developing synchrotron radiation methodology and its application in probing neurovascular networks, especially the pathological changes associated with vascular abnormalities in various model systems. Furthermore, this tool represents a powerful imaging modality that improves our understanding of the complex biological interactions between vascular function and neuronal activity in both physiological and pathological states.

AB  - Abstract In humans the toxic trace element lead (Pb) mainly accumulates in the skeletal tissue where it resides for a long period. Although Pb is known to play a role in bone and cartilage diseases, the distribution of Pb in these tissues is mostly unknown. Therefore synchrotron-radiation-induced micro x-ray fluorescence analysis (SR µ-XRF) in various geometries was used to determine the distributions of Pb, Ca, Zn and Sr at the cartilage-bone interface in human femoral heads and patellae. SR µ-XRF results were matched with backscattered electron (BE) images providing information on structural features of the tissue. Conventional SR µ-XRF at HASYLAB beamline L showed that Pb mostly accumulates in a zone of some micrometers around the transition between non-calcified and calcified cartilage. However, the relatively large sample thickness did not allow more precise conclusions. Exploiting the 3D capabilities of confocal SR µ-XRF and SR microfluorescence tomography at ANKA Fluo-Topo beamline and HASYLAB beamline L, the spatial resolution could be improved and a highly specific accumulation of Pb at the tidemark, the calcification front between non-calcified and calcified cartilage, was detected. It was found that Pb and Zn accumulation coincide at the tidemark. Since the tidemark plays an important role in osteoarthritis, the results may strengthen other authors' conclusions that Pb is associated with this joint disease. Although offering less spatial resolution when compared to micro-tomography, confocal SR µ-XRF is best suited for such studies. It facilitates the comparison of element maps with other imaging techniques like BE imaging. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the computed tomography (CT) features of the prostate gland and determine prostate size using CT in entire male dogs. Methods: The prostate gland was evaluated in 35 dogs. Morphological features including homogeneity, delineation, shape and intraprostatic differentiation were assessed. Height, length, width, area, volume and attenuation values of the prostate gland were measured. Ratios of prostatic height (rH), length and width to the sixth lumbar vertebral body length were calculated. Relationships of prostatic dimensions with body weight and age were evaluated. Results: The prostate gland was homogeneous in 29 dogs on non-contrast images and 18 of 24 dogs on postcontrast images. Transverse images revealed a semi-oval prostate gland in 29 dogs and irregularly shaped prostate gland in 6 dogs. A prominent median septum was observed in postcontrast images. Significant positive correlations were found between body weight and age and all prostatic dimensions except between age and rH. The mean ±sd values for attenuation were 59·3 ±9·1 and 121·3 ±22·7 HU in non-contrast and postcontrast image, respectively. Clinical Significance: CT can be useful for evaluating morphological features of the prostate gland. Prostatic length or width is a better measure than height for computed tomographic estimation of prostate size.

AB  - The anatomical response of Norway spruce bark polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) to inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica and attack by its bark-beetle vector Ips typographus was examined. Fungal inoculation on the periderm surface had no effect, while inoculation just below the periderm or halfway into the phloem (mid-phloem) generated detectable responses within 3 wk. The responses included increase in PP cell size and in periodic acid-Schiff's staining of PP cell phenolics, wound periderm initiation from PP cells, and cambial zone traumatic resin duct formation. Fungi were not seen in samples 3 wk after subperiderm or mid-phloem inoculation, but were found in some samples 6 and 9 wk after mid-phloem inoculation. In contrast, inoculations into the cambium resulted in partial (3 wk) or complete (6 and 9 wk) fungal colonization and death of tissue in the infected area. This indicates that PP cells have defenses capable of inhibiting fungal growth. Samples taken near bark-beetle galleries had similar anatomical responses as inoculated samples, validating the inoculation approach to studying defense responses in spruce. These results show that PP cells represent not only a constitutive defense system, but are also involved in local and remote inducible defenses against fungal and beetle attack.

AB  - Abstract Tissue approximation and repair are conventionally performed with sutures and staples, but these means are inherently traumatic. Tissue approximation using laser-responsive nanomaterials can lead to rapid tissue sealing and repair, and is an attractive alternative to existing clinical methods. Here, the use of laser-activated nanosealants (LANS) with gold nanorods (GNRs) embedded in silk fibroin polypeptide matrices is demonstrated. The adaptability of LANS for sealing soft tissues is demonstrated using two different modalities: insoluble thin films for internal, intestinal tissue repair, and semisoluble pastes for external repair, shown by skin repair in live mice. Laser repaired intestinal tissue held over seven times more fluid pressure than sutured intestine and also prevented bacterial leakage. Skin incisions in mice closed using LANS' showed indication of increased mechanical strength and faster repair compared to suturing. Laser-activated silk-GNR nanosealants rapidly seal soft-tissue tears and show high promise for tissue approximation and repair in trauma and routine surgery.

Methods: A DVD incorporating the recordings of 9 horses recovering from general anaesthesia was evaluated by final year students over 5 days. On Day 1, each evaluator ranked recoveries from 1?9 (1 = best). Over the following 4 days, each evaluator scored the same recoveries using 4 different RQSSs (3 of them in common usage and previously published) applied in random order. The scores from each RQSS were ranked and plotted against the Day 1 ranking of each evaluator to establish the extent of agreement using generalisability theory. The same 9 recoveries were also ranked by 12 experienced equine anaesthetists and the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient calculated to determine the agreement between experienced and inexperienced evaluators. Results: The recoveries were evaluated by 117 students. All 4 RQSSs were equally reliable with low (<4%) interobserver variability. The main (80%) source of total variation arose from differences between horses. The overall ranking within each RQSS was strongly correlated with Day 1 ranking. There was strong correlation (r = 0.983) between the students' ranking and that established by experienced anaesthetists. Interobserver reliability was similar with all 4 RQSSs. Conclusion: All 4 RQSSs studied were similarly reliable. Potential relevance: The selection of a universally acceptable RQSS from amongst the 4 examined can be based on criteria other than reliability, e.g. ease of use. This will facilitate wider scale multi-centre studies in recovery quality after anaesthesia in horses.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Abstract Nuclear medicine is the injection, ingestion or inhalation of a radiopharmaceutical for the purpose of diagnosis or therapy. It shares imaging synergies with both planar/general x-ray and to computed tomography (CT) in its acquisition methods. Nonetheless, the prime difference is that the focus of planar x-ray and CT is on morphology or anatomy while nuclear medicine has a focus on the evaluation of function or physiology. The history of nuclear medicine follows similar timelines to that of x-ray. Nuclear medicine, however, had a slower recognition and clinical permeation of its imaging/treatment methods and strengths as well as a delayed recognition of the dangers of these forms of ionising radiation. Both planar x-ray and planar nuclear medicine, and x-ray CT and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have emerged with greater integration in order provide improved diagnostic utility of each modality; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The strengths of x-ray imaging modalities and the treatment approaches used in radiation therapy are well understood by diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists. An understanding of the technical and clinical aspects of nuclear medicine and its imaging and treatments strengths can provide improved service provision and patient care.
