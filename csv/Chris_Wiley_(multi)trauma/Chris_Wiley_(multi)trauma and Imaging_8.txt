AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can induce long-term behavioral and cognitive disorders. Although the exact origin of these mTBI-related disorders is not known, they may be the consequence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Here, we investigated whether MRI at the subacute stage can detect lesions that are associated with poor functional outcome in mTBI by using anatomical images (T1) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-three patients with mTBI were investigated and compared with 23 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an MRI investigation and clinical tests between 7 and 28 days (D15) and between 3 and 4 months (M3) after injury. Patients were divided in two groups of poor outcome (PO) and good outcome (GO), based on their complaints at M3. Groupwise differences in gray matter partial volume between PO patients, GO patients and controls were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) from T1 data at D15. Differences in microstructural architecture were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and the diffusion images obtained from DTI data at D15. Permutation-based non-parametric testing was used to assess cluster significance at p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Twelve GO patients and 11 PO patients were identified on the basis of their complaints. In PO patients, gray matter partial volume was significantly lower in several cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls, but did not differ from that of GO patients. No difference in diffusion variables was found between GO and controls. PO patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity values than both controls and GO patients in the corpus callosum, the right anterior thalamic radiations and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. In conclusion, PO patients differed from GO patients by the presence of diffusion changes in long association white matter fiber tracts but not by gray matter partial volume. These results suggest that DTI at the subacute stage may be a predictive marker of poor outcome in mTBI. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma. This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also explain (to a greater or lesser extent) the enormous range of reactions to that event. These models are critically discussed in terms of their implications for counselling practice, and as guides to further research. Examples are given of ways in which the author has drawn on different theoretical frameworks to inform her own therapeutic practice in work with people experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - ABSTRACT In an effort to develop quantitative biomarkers for degenerative joint disease and fill the void that exists for diagnosing, monitoring, and assessing the extent of whole joint degeneration, the past decade has been marked by a greatly increased role of noninvasive imaging. This coupled with recent advances in image processing and deep learning opens new possibilities for promising quantitative techniques. The clinical translation of quantitative imaging was previously hampered by tedious non-scalable and subjective image analysis. Osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis using X-rays can be automated by the use of deep learning models and pilot studies showed feasibility of using similar techniques to reliably segment multiple musculoskeletal tissues and detect and stage the severity of morphological abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Automation and more advanced feature extraction techniques have applications on larger more heterogeneous samples. Analyses based on voxel based relaxometry have shown local patterns in relaxation time elevations and local correlations with outcome variables. Bone cartilage interactions are also enhanced by the analysis of three-dimensional bone morphology and the potential for the assessment of metabolic activity with simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MR systems. Novel techniques in image processing and deep learning are augmenting imaging to be a source of quantitative and reliable data and new multidimensional analytics allow us to exploit the interactions of data from various sources. In this review, we aim to summarize recent advances in quantitative imaging, the application of image processing and deep learning techniques to study knee and hip OA. ?2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small brain hemorrhages caused by the break down or structural abnormalities of small vessels of the brain. Owing to the paramagnetic properties of blood degradation products, CMBs can be detected in vivo using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). SWI can be used not only to detect iron changes and CMBs, but also to differentiate them from calcifications, both of which may be important MR-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, SWI can be used to quantify the iron in CMBs. SWI and gradient echo (GE) imaging are the two most common methods for the detection of iron deposition and CMBs. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the number of voxels detected in the presence of a CMB on GE magnitude, phase and SWI composite images as a function of resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), TE, field strength and susceptibility using in silico experiments. Susceptibility maps were used to quantify the bias in the effective susceptibility value and to determine the optimal TE for CMB quantification. We observed a non-linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the magnitude images, but a linear trend with susceptibility for CMB detection from the phase and SWI composite images. The optimal TE values for CMB quantification were found to be 3?ms at 7?T, 7?ms at 3?T and 14?ms at 1.5?T for a CMB of one voxel in diameter with an SNR of 20: 1. The simulations of signal loss and detectability were used to generate theoretical formulae for predictions. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI) frequently report symptoms of increased distractability and sensory disturbances during mutisensory stimulation. These common post-concussive symptoms could putatively result from dysfunction within the cognitive control network (CCN; top-down) or from unisensory cortex (bottom-up) itself. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-resolution structural data were therefore prospectively collected during a multisensory (audio-visual) cognitive control task from 46 mTBI patients within 3 weeks of injury and 46 matched healthy controls (HC), with a subset of participants returning at 4 months. Multisensory stimuli were presented at two frequencies to manipulate cognitive and perceptual load. Patients self-reported more cognitive, emotional, somatic, vestibular and visual symptoms relative to HC, which improved, but did not entirely resolve, over the 4 month follow-up period. There were no group differences in behavior or functional activation during cognitive control (incongruent ? congruent trials). In contrast, patients exhibited abnormal activation within different regions of visual cortex that depended on whether attention was focused on auditory or visual information streams. Patients also exhibited increased activation within bilateral inferior parietal lobules during higher cognitive/perceptual loads, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to achieve similar levels of behavioral performance. Functional abnormalities within the visual cortex and inferior parietal lobules were only partially resolved at 4 months post-injury, suggesting that neural abnormalities may take longer to resolve than behavioral measures used in most clinical settings. In summary, current results indicate that abnormalities within unisensory cortex (particularly visual areas) following mTBI, which likely contribute to deficits commonly reported during multisensory stimulation.

AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

AB  - Abstract:? Anthropological examination of defleshed bones is the gold standard for osteological measurement in forensic practice. However, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) offers the opportunity of three-dimensional imaging of skeletal elements, allowing measurement of bones in any plane without defleshing. We present our experiences of the examination of 15 human lower limbs in different states of decomposition using MDCT. We present our method of imaging and radiological measurement of the bones including sex assessment. The radiological measurements were undertaken by three professional groups?anthropology, radiology, and forensic pathology?both at the site of scanning and at a remote site. The results were compared to anthropological oestological assessment of the defleshed bones. We discuss the limitations of this technique and the potential applications of our observations. We introduce the concept of remote radiological anthropological measurement of bones, so-called tele-anthro-radiology and the role that this could play in providing the facility for standardization of protocols, international peer review and quality assurance schemes.

AB  - Summary Renal injuries are mostly managed conservatively. Operative intervention with view of kidney salvage is possible. However, nephrectomy may be the only option to control life-threatening haemorrhage. During the conservative period, it is extremely important to keep patients under close monitoring because this will allow early identification of patients who will require surgical intervention. Ureteral injuries are relatively rare and mostly iatrogenic. Management of the ureteral injuries depends level of injury, severity, and on time (early or late) of recognition of the injury. Careful assessment (cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram) and appropriate imaging computed tomography urogram or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are essential to select most suitable method of repair of ureteral injury.

AB  - Summary Imaging, plain and contrast-enhanced, and uroendoscopy is essential to interventional evaluation and treatment of the urinary tract of dog and cat, and are often best used in combination. This chapter explains the indications, procedures, complications, and interpretation of some of the most common imaging studies performed for the urinary tract. Excretory urography (EU) may be performed using traditional radiography, fluoroscopy, or computed tomography (CT). Contraindications of these techniques are related to the use of intravenous injection of iodinated contrast media and the need for sedation or general anesthesia. There are three phases of the excretory urogram: vascular, nephrogram, and pyelogram. Contrast cystography allows for visualization of the urinary bladder, assessment of bladder wall integrity, thickness and contour, and the investigation of intraluminal abnormalities such as cystoliths and masses. The urinary bladder should be evaluated for normal margination, shape, location, and lack of contrast media extravasation.

Methods A patient presented with T2 and T3 vertebral body fractures visible on recumbent CT. Supine and upright plain x-rays with additional swimmer's views were deemed suboptimal prior to mobilization. The default configuration of the O-arm was modified to enable imaging in the upright position. Results Images utilizing the O-arm were satisfactory and anatomic alignment confirmed in an upright position. It is believed that this is the first time the O-arm has been used for upright diagnostic imaging (off-label application). Excellent visualization of the cervicothoracic junction and upper thoracic regions was obtained in the desired upright position. Conclusion The O-arm was used successfully to image spinal trauma in the upright position and may represent a new application of the device, potentially fulfilling a frequently unmet medical imaging need.

AB  - Abstract When a single coil is used to measure perfusion by arterial spin labeling, saturation of macromolecular protons occurs during the labeling period. Induced magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) effects decrease tissue water signal intensity, reducing the sensitivity of the technique. In addition, MTC effects must be properly accounted for in acquiring a control image. This forces the image to a single slice centered between the labeling plane and the control plane. In this work, a two-coil system is presented as a way to avoid saturation of macromolecular spins during arterial spin labeling. The system consists of one small surface coil for labeling the arterial water spins, and a head coil for MRI, actively decoupled from the labeling coil by using PIN diodes. It is shown that no signal loss occurs due to MTC effects when the two-coil system is used for MRI of rat brain perfusion, enabling three-dimensional perfusion imaging. Using the two-coil system, a multi-slice MRI sequence was used to study the regional effects of amphetamine on brain perfusion. Amphetamine causes significant increases in perfusion in many areas of the brain including the cortex, cingulate, and caudate putamen, in agreement with previous results using deoxyglucose uptake to monitor brain activation.

AB  - A timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals? PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants? item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants? education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents? female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals? PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.

There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background The image-guided operating room (OR) is an emerging standard for dealing with complex cases in many surgical disciplines including neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, maxillofacial trauma, and orthopedic surgery. Its use in head and neck oncological surgery is not well established. The primary aim of this study was to assess the image quality of cone-beam CT (CBCT) under real clinical conditions. The secondary aim was to assess the effect on surgical performance and decision making. Methods Intraoperative 3D imaging was performed using a CBCT capable C-Arm mounted on a multi-axis robot (Siemens Zeego) in the image-guided OR. All patients had immediate preoperative imaging taken with further intraoperative imaging performed as required. Ten initial patients, comprising 28 intraoperative scans, were used for questionnaire-based image reviews conducted with experienced head and neck clinicians. Scans were assessed for aspects of both image quality and clinical utility, on separate 5-point Likert scales (1-5). Results The median rating for bony detail was 4 out of 5. Vascular detail was increased (P < 10?8) from 1 to 3 with the use of IV contrast (region of interest CT# was 284 HU [SD, 47 HU]). Images were rated as 4 for freedom from artifact. Soft tissue definition was 2, with no significant improvement (P =?.2) with the addition of IV iodinated contrast. Surgeons rated the greatest clinical utility (4) for the CBCT when assessing postreconstruction imaging of a complex case. Conclusions The image quality of CBCT in the image-guided OR is good for bony detail and complex oncological reconstructions in the head and neck setting but probably has limited benefit for intraoperative soft tissue delineation. Future studies must also focus on clinical outcomes to help demonstrate the value of the image-guided OR.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between psychosocial reaction, coping behavior and trauma among natural disaster survivors in West Java, Indonesia. One hundred and one subjects were studied. The roles of coping behavior as a moderating factor were also tested. Psychosocial reaction during disaster and coping behavior were significantly correlated with trauma. Hierarchical regression analysis found that coping behavior was a significant potential moderating variable in terms of correlation between psychosocial reaction and trauma after a natural disaster.

AB  - Summary.? We conducted a review of a single institutional experience of patients with haemophilia presenting with suspected intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) who underwent computed tomographic (CT) neuro-imaging. We found that over a 9-year period (1996?2004) 43 patients with haemophilia presented 73 times with suspected ICH: 10 presented multiple times (range: 2?9 times). The median age at presentation was 3.5?years (range: 0.5?17). Preceding trauma occurred in most (62/73; 85%) episodes. ICH was confirmed in 11 of the 73 (16%) episodes in eight patients. Patients with severe haemophilia accounted for a disproportionate number of episodes of suspected (60/73; 82%) and of confirmed ICH (10/11; 91%). All ICH occurred in patients not on prophylaxis; five occurred in three inhibitor-positive patients. Altered consciousness at presentation was present in 10/11 (91%) cases of confirmed ICH but only in 5/62 (8%) (ICH-negative) episodes. The positive and negative predictive values of altered consciousness to predict/rule out an ICH was 67% and 98%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of presenting with suspected ICH and of having a confirmed ICH: (i) having severe haemophilia; (ii) not being on prophylaxis; (iii) having an inhibitor; and (iv) presenting with an altered level of consciousness. Patients without any of these features may not need to undergo CT imaging when presenting with suspected ICH. Ideally a prospective study to evaluate this hypothesis should be conducted.
