AB  - Abstract Low back pain is one of commonest problems prompting a visit to the family physician. Up to 5% of patients with chronic low back pain in the primary care setting are diagnosed as having spondyloarthritis, which includes the prototype disease ankylosing spondylitis. Making a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is often delayed for years, leading to significant pain, impairment of quality of life, disability and productivity loss. A recent breakthrough in the treatment of spondyloarthritis is the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha biologics, which lead to rapid relief of pain and inflammation, and improvement in all clinical parameters of the disease. Patients with early spondyloarthritis often respond better than those with late established disease. With proper recognition of inflammatory back pain, and the use of magnetic resonance imaging, spondyloarthritis can now be diagnosed much earlier before features are evident on plain radiographs. Referral to the rheumatologist based on onset of back pain (> 3 months) before the age of 45 years, and an inflammatory nature of the pain, or the presence of human leukocyte antigen-B27, or sacroiliitis by imaging, have been confirmed in multi-center international studies to be a pragmatic approach to enable early diagnosis of spondyloarthritis. This referral strategy has recently been adopted by the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology for primary care physicians and non-rheumatology specialists.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of human suffering and disability for which disease-modifying treatments are lacking. OA occurs through complex and dynamic interplays between diverse factors over long periods of time. The traditional research and clinical focus on OA, the end stage disease, obscured understanding pathogenesis prior to reaching a common pathway defined by pain and functional deficits, joint deformity, and radiographic changes. To emphasize disease modification and prevention, we describe a multi-disciplinary systems-based approach encompassing biology, mechanics, and structure to define pre-osteoarthritic disease processes. Central to application of this model is the concept of ?pre-osteoarthritis,? conditions where clinical OA has not yet developed. Rather, joint homeostasis has been compromised and there are potentially reversible markers for heightened OA risk. Key messages from this perspective are (i) to focus research onto defining pre-OA through identifying and validating biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of OA risk, (ii) to emphasize multi-disciplinary approaches, and (iii) to propose that developing personalized interventions to address reversible markers of OA risk in healthy joints may be the key to prevention. Ultimately, a systems-based analysis of OA pathogenesis shows potential to transform clinical practice by facilitating development and testing of new strategies to prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - An art work that refuses the boundaries of word and image, image and music, that was made in defiance of art history's preferred models of style, movement and period, Charlotte Salomon's vast interdisciplinary project Leben? oder Theater? (1941?42) challenges art history but responds well to models of feminist reading of visual narrative and semiotics proposed by Mieke Bal's practice of cultural analysis and working with concepts. Viewed since its belated discovery as a largely autobiographical text, Charlotte Salomon's huge work is here examined through the lens of two concepts: Benjamin's ?theatre of memory? and Braccha Ettinger's idea of ?art working?. Taking seriously the interrogative form of the title, the article asks both how an art work can be an investigation and what this art work was questioning. Close reading of key images that explore the inner worlds of three women that form a counter series to the overt narrative sequence of the final text, the text is analytically ?listened to? in order to plot out the nature of the questions it poses about life, death, creativity through a memorial restaging of the lives and deaths of four women and one man. Focusing on the visual strategies in the paintings, the visual and acoustic leitmotifs that pictorially define the major ?players?, and tracing the semiotic and affective freight of the colour blue, the article examines the journey the work performed for the artist through the prism of Ettinger's proposal about ?art as a transport station of trauma? that might open up to trans-subjective border space in which the trauma of loss can be encountered and worked through.

AB  - The energy-sensing AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (AMPK) confers cell survival in part by stimulation of cellular energy production and limitation of cellular energy utilization. AMPK-sensitive functions further include activities of epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and voltage-gated K+ channel KCNE1/KCNQ1. AMPK is activated by an increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The present study explored whether AMPK regulates the Ca2+-sensitive large conductance and voltage-gated potassium (BK) channel. cRNA encoding BK channel was injected into Xenopus oocytes with and without additional injection of wild-type AMPK (AMPKα1+AMPK?1+AMPK?1), constitutively active AMPK?R70Q, or inactive AMPKαK45R. BK-channel activity was determined utilizing the 2-electrode voltage-clamp. Moreover, BK-channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined by confocal immunomicroscopy. As BK channels are expressed in outer hair cells (OHC) of the inner ear and lack of BK channels increases noise vulnerability, OHC BK-channel expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and hearing function analyzed by auditory brain stem response measurements in AMPKα1-deficient mice (ampk?/?) and in wild-type mice (ampk+/+). As a result, coexpression of AMPK or AMPK?R70Q but not of AMPKαK45R significantly enhanced BK-channel-mediated currents and BK-channel protein abundance in the oocyte cell membrane. BK-channel expression in the inner ear was lower in ampk?/? mice than in ampk+/+ mice. The hearing thresholds prior to and immediately after an acoustic overexposure were similar in ampk?/? and ampk+/+ mice. However, the recovery from the acoustic trauma was significantly impaired in ampk?/?mice compared to ampk+/+ mice. In summary, AMPK is a potent regulator of BK channels. It may thus participate in the signaling cascades that protect the inner ear from damage following acoustic overstimulation.?Föller, M., Jaumann, M., Dettling, J., Saxena, A., Pakladok, T., Munoz, C., Ruth, P., Sopjani, M., Seebohm, G., Rüttiger, L., Knipper, M., Lang, F.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and disease progression are poorly understood, in part as a result of the lack of non-invasive methods to measure and monitor neurodegeneration in vivo. Sodium MRI is a topic of increasing interest in MS research as it allows the metabolic characterization of brain tissue in vivo, and integration with the structural information provided by 1H MRI, helping in the exploration of pathogenetic mechanisms and possibly offering insights into disease progression and monitoring of treatment outcomes. We present an up-to-date review of the sodium MRI application in MS organized into four main sections: (i) biological and pathogenetic role of sodium; (ii) brief overview of sodium imaging techniques; (iii) results of sodium MRI application in clinical studies; and (iv) future perspectives.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

AB  - The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) seems to vary according to the disease stage, which greatly influences the management of PD patients. However, the underlying mechanism of progression in PD remains unclear. This study was designed to explore the progressive pattern of iron accumulation at different stages in PD patients. Sixty right-handed PD patients and 40 normal controls were recruited. According to the disease stage, 45 patients with Hoehn?Yahr stage?≤?2.5 and 15 patients with Hoehn?Yahr stage?≥?3 were grouped into early-stage PD (EPD) and late-stage PD (LPD) groups, respectively. The iron content in the cardinal subcortical nuclei covering the cerebrum, cerebellum and midbrain was measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) showed significantly increased QSM values in the EPD patients compared with the controls. In the LPD patients, while the SNc continued to show increased QSM values compared with the controls and EPD patients, the regions showing increased QSM values spread to include the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), red nucleus (RN) and globus pallidus (GP). Our data also indicated that iron deposition was more significant in the GP internal segment (GPi) than in the GP external segment. No other regions showed significant changes in QSM values among the groups. Therefore, we were able to confirm a regionally progressive pattern of iron accumulation in the different stages of PD, indicating that iron deposition in the SNc is affected exclusively in the early stages of the disease, while the SNr, RN and GP, and particularly the GPi segment, become involved in advanced stages of the disease. This is a preliminary study providing objective evidence of the iron-related progression in PD. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Changes in the magnetic resonance (MR) parameters of demyelinated neural tissue were measured in vitro using an experimental animal model. A tellurium (Te) diet was applied to weanling rats to induce the demyelination process in the sciatic nerve. The quantitative MR parameters, such as T1, T2 relaxation time constants and magnetization transfer (MT) were measured each day after applying the Te diet (up to 7 days) and were found to be substantially different from those of normal nerves. An increase in the average T1 and T2 was observed along with a decrease in the MT ratio (MTR) and the quantitative MT parameter M0B, which describes the semisolid pool of protons. Most of the MR parameters correlated very well with the myelin fraction of neural tissue evaluated by quantitative histopathology. The T2 relaxation spectrum provided the most efficient quantitative assessment of changes in neural tissue microstructure and its analysis resulted in a powerful tool to distinguish the processes of demyelination and inflammation. In comparison, the MT measurements were less successful. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Disc bulge and disc desiccation are the most common abnormalities occurring in the spine, which leads to severe low back pain. Despite computer-aided automatic abnormality diagnostic imaging systems are available still there is a need for betterment in diagnostic accuracy and in processing time. Image processing with combined imaging features like shape and texture has given better diagnostic ability when compared with processing with individual features. In the present study, the desiccated and bulged Intervertebral Discs (IVDs) are diagnosed automatically by combining shape features extracted using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and texture feature extracted using novel Local Sub-Rhombus Binary Relation Pattern (LS-RBRP) techniques with Random Forest (RF) classifier. The performance analysis projects that the RF with HOG+LS-RBRP has an overall better accuracy of 94.7% when compared with HOG (87%) and LS-RBRP (90.2%) with RF classifier separately in categorizing the normal IVD, disc bulge and disc desiccation in the lumbar spine MRI.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Introduction Ultrasonography is used for functional assessment of deep peri-vertebral muscles in people with neck pain. This study evaluated intra-operator and inter-operator reliability and repeatability of ultrasound image acquisition (US) and muscle cross-sectional area measurement (CSA) of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the equine cervical spine. Methods Two US operators independently acquired 60 unilateral US images per horse from 5 standing horses (mean?±?SD: age: 12.1?±?10.5 years) at spinal levels C3-C6 (m. multifidus) and C2-C5 (m. longus colli). Each operator traced each image blindly three times (n?=?360 per operator) to calculate CSA. ANOVA analysis compared CSA across all subjects within and between operators for effects of vertebral level, reliability of image acquisition and repeatability of CSA calculation. Results Intra-operator results for m. multifidus were 72% (ICC) and 5% (CV), and 90% (ICC) and 4% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C6. Intra-operator results for m. longus colli were 100% (ICC) and 0% (CV), and 77% (ICC) and 0% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C2. CSA for both muscles was largest at C4 and C5. Conclusions Ultrasonography could be used reliably and repeatably for CSA measurement of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the mid-cervical spine of the horse. Further studies will determine reliability across time and CSA side-side symmetry in horses with neck pain.

AB  - ABSTRACT Congenital aortic stenosis was diagnosed in six cats. Clinical findings included dyspnoea, systolic murmurs with maximal intensity at the left apex or right sternal border, and cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure. Some clinical features of feline aortic stenosis were similar to those observed in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Definitive diagnosis was obtained by angiographic imaging of a discrete, consistent subvalvular obstruction, Doppler-echocardio-graphy, or by necropsy. Although, two of the cats were diagnosed at ages older than usually reported, the overall prognosis for cats with aortic stenosis was poor. Four of the six cats died or were euthanased within one year of the onset of clinical signs.

Objectives To describe clinical features of cases undergoing tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD and estimate the prevalence of abnormalities within the plantar pouch. Study design Retrospective case review. Methods Case records of all horses that had tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD at Rossdales Equine Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included (n?=?99). Descriptive data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed in Microsoft Excel. Results Warmbloods/Warmblood-crosses were significantly over-represented compared to the normal hospital population, comprising 42.4% (CI 32.7?52.2%) of the study (P<0.001), followed by Thoroughbreds/Thoroughbred-crosses (33.7%, CI 25.0?43.7%), 22 other horse breeds and one pony. Cases were predominantly male (70.7%, CI 63.6?81.3%) with 48.5% geldings, 19.2% colts and 3.0% stallions. Median age was 2.9 years (0.1?13.5 years) and median weight was 523?kg (112?919?kg). Most were nonracing sports horses (40.4%, CI 30.7?50.1%), or unbroken (27.0%, CI 18.5?36.0%) with the remainder used for breeding, general purpose or racing. Reasons for presentation were lameness (52.7%, CI 42.5?63.0%), effusion (36.3%, CI 26.4?46.1%), or survey radiographs (11.0%, CI 4.6?17.4%). Tarsocrural arthroscopy was most frequently performed bilaterally (41.8%, CI 32.1?51.6%), followed by left hind (35.7%, CI 26.2?45.2%), then right hind (22.4%, CI 14.2?30.7%). Irrespective of pathology in the dorsal pouch, examination of the plantar pouch was performed in 70 joints (50 horses), and in 78.0% (CI 66.5?89.5%) abnormalities were found. Of these, 10 required removal of organised fibrinous debris or osteochondral fragments (25.6% CI 11.9?39.3%), none of which were recorded using diagnostic imaging presurgery. Conclusions Investigation of the plantar pouch is indicated in routine tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD as it often reveals additional pathology, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Further work will evaluate how plantar pouch pathology may influence prognosis. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained, project number AHT48-2013.

AB  - Abstract L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that is associated with axonal growth, including formation of the corticospinal tract (CST). The present study describes the effects of L1 deletion on hindlimb function in locomotion, and examines the role of L1 in recovery and remodeling after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Uninjured adult L1 knockout (Y/?) mice had impaired performance on locomotor tests compared with their wild-type littermates (Y/+). Anterograde tracing demonstrated that CST axons project to thoracic, but not lumbar, levels of the spinal cord of Y/? mice, and revealed a diversion of these fibers from their position in the base of the dorsal columns. Retrograde tracing also revealed reduced numbers of descending projections from paraventricular hypothalamus and red nuclei to the lumbar spinal cord in Y/? mice. SCI at the mid-thoracic level produced a lesion encompassing the center of the spinal cord, including the site of the dorsal CST and surrounding gray matter (GM). The injury caused lasting deficits in fine aspects of locomotion. There was no effect of genotype on final lesion size or the growth of axons into the lesion area. However, injured Y/? mice demonstrated a robust expansion of CST projections throughout the GM of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord rostral to the lesion compared with Y/+ littermates. Thus, L1 is important for the development of multiple spinal projections and also contributes to the restriction of CST sprouting rostral to the site of a SCI in adults.

AB  - Summary Background There is a need for investigation of associations between intrasynovial medication and fracture risk in racehorses. Objectives To document the proportion and type of fracture occurring following intrasynovial medication. Study design Retrospective longitudinal study. Methods Review of clinical records from all Thoroughbred flat racehorses receiving intrasynovial medication under the care of a first-opinion veterinary practice between 2006 and 2011. Fractures pre- and post-medication were categorised by location, type, and severity; analysis of fractures sustained within 56-days of medication was undertaken. Survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models were conducted for associations between medication used (corticosteroid vs. non-corticosteroid), age at first medication, sex and total number of medications and fracture. Results A total of 1488 horses received intrasynovial medication during the period of study; 8692 synovial spaces were medicated in 3925 sessions. There were 96 fractures that occurred within 56-days of medication, of which 44 were classified as ?serious? (44/1488; 3.0% total population, 95% CI 2.1, 3.8%) and 11 (11/1488, 0.7%, 95% CI 0.3, 1.2%) were euthanased due to severity of injury. Fifty-four of 96 cases (56.4%, 95% CI 46.3, 66.2%) returned to racing. Targeted imaging of the subsequent injury site was undertaken prior to injury in only 7 (7/96, 7.3%) horses that injured post-medication. Horses that had received ≥3 previous intrasynovial medication sessions had an increased hazard of sustaining a fracture within 56 days (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.51, 3.54, P<0.001) compared with those receiving ≤3 medication sessions, adjusted for each increasing year of age (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53, 0.86, P = 0.001). Main limitations Absence of an unexposed cohort of nonmedicated racehorses. Conclusions Serious musculoskeletal injury following intrasynovial medication occurred in 3% (44/1488) horses. Reduction in injury rates may be possible through greater use of premedication diagnostic imaging.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.
