AB  - Cough has been historically reported as a major clinical sign of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in dogs. However, recent evidence appears to contradict the traditional dogmatic approach that linked cough to congestive heart failure in dogs. Here we use a question-based format to introduce and discuss the modern evidence regarding ?cardiac cough? and the interpretation of this important but often misleading clinical sign.

AB  - Abstract Acute exertional compartment syndrome is the result of muscle ischemia within a tight fascial compartment. We report a 22-year-old boxer, with recent intake of anabolic steroids, who developed acute exertional compartment syndrome of the lower legs following an assault from which he had to run away. He presented with bilateral footdrop. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) were consistent with bilateral deep and superficial peroneal neuropathies, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated hemorrhagic necrosis of the pretibial muscles. This case illustrates that the differential diagnosis for footdrop includes not only central and peripheral nervous system and muscle causes, but also compartment syndromes. Muscle Nerve, 2005

AB  - Abstract Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is significant secondary damage to cerebral tissue from increased free radicals and impaired mitochondrial function. This imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the effectiveness of cellular antioxidant defenses is termed oxidative stress. Often there are insufficient antioxidants to scavenge ROS, leading to alterations in cerebral structure and function. Attenuating oxidative stress following a TBI by administering an antioxidant may decrease secondary brain injury, and currently many drugs and supplements are being investigated. We explored an over-the-counter supplement called ubiquinol (reduced form of coenzyme Q10), a potent antioxidant naturally produced in brain mitochondria. We administered intra-arterial ubiquinol to rats to determine if it would reduce mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and severity of a contusive TBI. Adult male F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Saline-TBI, (2) ubiquinol 30 minutes before TBI (UB-PreTBI), or (3) ubiquinol 30 minutes after TBI (UB-PostTBI). We found when ubiquinol was administered before or after TBI, rats had an acute reduction in brain mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and two serum biomarkers of TBI severity, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). However, in vivo neurometabolic assessment with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not show attenuated injury-induced changes. These findings are the first to show that ubiquinol preserves mitochondria and reduces cellular injury severity after TBI, and support further study of ubiquinol as a promising adjunct therapy for TBI.

AB  - Introduction In people with neck pain, ultrasonography (US) can measure atrophy and response to physiotherapy in peri-vertebral muscles of the cervical spine, i.e. m. multifidus and m. longus colli. This study compared the reproducibility of muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements made by US and MRI (the gold standard) at different levels in the equine cervical spine. Methods From US and MRI images of three mature pony cadavers, CSA was calculated at vertebral levels C3-C6 (m. multifidus) and C2-C5 (m. longus colli). ANOVA analysis compared US and MRI image acquisition reliability (n?=?360) and CSA (n?=?1080) among subjects and vertebral levels. Results For image acquisition of m. multifidus (C3-C5), the ICC (95% CI) for MRI and US was 99% and 61%, respectively. Image acquisition was unreliable at C6. CSA calculation did not differ between MRI and US. For m. longus colli (C3-C5), the ICC for image acquisition was 100% and 88% for MRI and US, respectively. Image acquisition was unreliable at C2. The ICC for CSA calculation was 98% for MRI and 100% for US. For both muscles, the mean CSA was largest at C4 and C5. Conclusions Based on these results, ultrasonography could be used in the live horse for reliable CSA measurement of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the mid-cervical spine. This technique may advance knowledge of causes and effects of neck pain in horses. Ethical Animal Research Approval for this study was obtained under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee number 02-11/020-00. The study was performed on material collected during post-mortem examination. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Summary Imaging-assisted orthopaedic surgery is becoming part of routine orthopaedic practice in horses and several techniques have been reported. However, there are no published reports describing the use of intraoperative computed tomography (CT) for surgical guidance and immediate post operative control in the horse. This use of CT in equine orthopaedics is currently limited because of the logistic problems associated with availability of CT scans in surgical theatres as well as concerns over radiation safety. The aim of this report was retrospectively to report CT assisted orthopaedic surgical cases in our practice through identifying the types of surgery where it was used, to list the technical problems that were encountered, to describe solutions to these, and to discuss the applications of the technique. All surgical procedures were performed with the assistance of a peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scanner. CT assisted orthopaedic surgery in 86 patients during the study period. Reasons for CT included: 1) use of CT at the beginning of the surgical procedure to document the lesion and identify surgical landmarks (n = 75); 2) pre, intra- and post operative use of CT in comminuted fractures of the middle or proximal phalanx to guide and control internal fixation (n = 7); and 3) post operative use of CT to monitor the results of the surgical procedure (n = 4). Proper planning in both the draping steps and the use of polyvinyl splints to stabilise the limb allowed for movements of the gantry around the limb. The time required to obtain one slice was not dissimilar to the time that is necessary to take and process a single digital radiograph. The radiation dose with the pQCT described here is <0.5?µSv and its acquisition time should be balanced against radiation risks of conventional CT systems.

AB  - Abstract Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays key roles in cell adhesion and migration. We now report that the delayed rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channel, through its LD-like motif in N-terminus, may interact with FAK and enhance phosphorylation of FAK397 and FAK576/577. Overlapping distribution of Kv2.1 and FAK was observed on soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. FAK expression promotes a polarized membrane distribution of the Kv2.1 channel. In Kv2.1-transfected CHO cells, formation of the Kv2.1-FAK complex was stimulated by fibronectin/integrin and inhibited by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). FAK phosphorylation was minimized by shRNA knockdown of the Kv2.1 channel, point mutations of the N-terminus, and TEA, respectively. Cell migration morphology was altered by Kv2.1 knockdown or TEA, hindering cell migration activity. In wound healing tests in vitro and a traumatic injury animal model, Kv2.1 expression and co-localization of Kv2.1 and FAK significantly enhanced directional cell migration and wound closure. It is suggested that the Kv2.1 channel may function as a promoting signal for FAK activation and cell motility. J. Cell. Physiol. 217: 544?557, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The success of implantation of materials into bone is governed by effective osseointegration, requiring biocompatibility of the material and the attachment and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D?printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D?printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

AB  - Objectives To estimate the incidence proportion of road traffic accidents in cats attending emergency out-of-hours clinics in the UK, identify major risk factors for road traffic accident occurrence and for survival to discharge. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of a cohort of 33,053 cats in the VetCompass database attending emergency-care practice between January 1, 2012 and February 15, 2014. Incidence proportion was calculated and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for road traffic accident and survival to discharge following road traffic accident. Results Incidence proportion was estimated at 4∙2% (95% confidence interval: 4∙0 to 4∙4%). Cats aged 6 months to 2 years were at increased odds of road traffic accident, as were male cats and crossbred cats. Odds of road traffic accident were highest in the autumn. Spinal injury, abdominal injury and increasing count of injuries were associated with increased odds of death. Clinical Significance Road traffic accident is a frequent presentation in emergency-care practice. Identification of risk factors for death within the first 24?hours following a road traffic accident can aid veterinarian and owner decision-making for treatment of cats involved in a road traffic accident.

AB  - ABSTRACT Myeloproliferative disorders involving the megakaryocytic line are uncommon but in recent years several reports have come from North America and the United Kingdom describing megakaryoblastic leukaemia (MbL) and a particular form called essential thrombocythaemia (ET). This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - Summary Psychology pervades all aspects of human life. To better understand the psychology of violence, especially as it is relevant beyond the surface, psychological principles can prove very useful. Psychology can shed light on human violence in terms of different levels of motivation, defenses, and paradoxical thinking. Violence is complex and can be difficult to understand at first glance. It helps to know, therefore, how hidden motives form and how understandable attempts to avoid emotional pain can result in maladaptive behavior and cause pain in return. For this, we cannot reduce psychology to the currently popular neuroscience, cognitivism, or behaviorism. Rather, we will have to understand it in its own right. The branch that deals with deeper motives and unconscious processes, as are helpful to understanding violence, is psychodynamic theory. Psychodynamic theory can be particularly helpful to identifying various defense mechanisms, paradoxical aspects of the mind, and the importance of early experiences in understanding how individuals or groups turn violent. While its scope of intrapsychic events can be a drawback, delving into intimate emotional life is essential to understanding the depths of the mind. More recent concepts in positive psychology can also complement traditional approaches and help us to avert determinism in trauma and violence.

AB  - Abstract This study aims to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of continuous catheter drainage versus intermittent needle aspiration in the percutaneous treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses. Over a 5-year period, 64 consecutive patients with pyogenic liver abscess were treated with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, cefuroxime, and metronidazole) and randomized into two percutaneous treatment groups: continuous catheter drainage (with an 8F multi-sidehole pigtail catheter); and intermittent needle aspiration (18G disposable trocar needle). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding patient demographics, underlying coexisting disease, abscess size, abscess number, number of loculation of abscess, the presenting clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and pretreatment liver function test. Although not statistically significant, the duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment before percutaneous treatment was longer with the catheter group, and the change of antibiotics after the sensitivity test was more frequent with the needle group. The needle group was associated with a higher treatment success rate, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower mortality rate, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that intermittent needle aspiration is probably as effective as continuous catheter drainage for the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, although further proof with a large-scale study is necessary. Due to the additional advantages of procedure simplicity, patient comfort, and reduced price, needle aspiration deserves to be considered as a first-line drainage approach.

AB  - Abstract A child who had had surgery at 5 months of age, and who had been treated at the time for post-traumatic symptoms (reported in a previous paper by the author), was interviewed 2 years later and almost 3 years later to test for possible verbal recall of his hospitalization. He appeared to have some memories of the experience at 29 months of age, and he was able to superimpose verbal labels onto the preverbal memories. At 40 months of age, however, the memories were no longer verbally accessible. The results are discussed in the context of different theories of encoding, storage, retrieval, and loss of early memories. The findings from this study support other findings indicating that there appears to be some form of long-term memory in place early in life, at least for highly salient, traumatic events. There may be one memory system for traumatic memories, fully functional at birth, and a later developing, different system for neutral memories. It is further hypothesized that there may be a sensitive period around 2?3 years of age for the recall of early traumatic memories, and that verbal recall is more likely to be present in verbally precocious children during that period.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Purpose We introduce the quantitative, continuous marker cartilage cavity that quantifies cartilage lesions by the total lesion volume. The aim was to quantify small lesions as well as large, full-depth lesions. Methods We included 315 knees from the Center for Clinical and Basic Research (CCBR), 972 knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), and 791 knees from the Prevention of OA in Overweight Females (PROOF) cohorts. In a subset, we digitally inserted artificial lesions. Each knee MRI was segmented using the knee imaging quantification (KIQ) framework. We quantified cartilage mean thickness and cavity from high-resolution cartilage thickness maps. Finally, we quantified lesion volume by the gradient peak method (GPM). Results Scan?rescan precision for cartilage cavity was 7.1%/3.0%. The cartilage cavity accuracy on the artificial lesions was determined as linear correlation at 0.88 with an average 8% under-estimation of lesion volume. Cavity and degree of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) correlated for all compartments (Spearman's rho between 0.14?0.56, P?<?0.001). Cavity had modest correlations to whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) cartilage lesion scores but strong correlations with Boston-Leeds osteoarthritis knee score (BLOKS)/MRI osteoarthritis knee score (MOAKS) scores in most compartments (rho between 0.08?0.65, P?<?0.001). Cavity correlated with WOMAC pain for all tibio-femoral compartments in OAI (rho between 0.19?0.25, P?<?0.001) and most compartments in PROOF. Comparing with the GPM estimate, cavity was more precise, more accurate, and correlated stronger with ROA, lesion scores, and pain levels. Conclusion The strong correlations with ROA, radiologist lesion scores, and pain demonstrated that cavity captured OA and lesion features. Thereby, it may be appropriate for quantification of cartilage surface irregularity.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Cervical spine lesions are often suspected in horses with neurological signs, abnormal head/neck position and obscure forelimb lameness. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to image the cervical spine in 3 dimensions in superior anatomical detail; e.g. lesions that cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, small fragments, and osteoarthritis of the articular process joints may be more easily detected. Objectives To investigate if CT and CT myelography of the entire cervical spine is possible in horses, describe the technique used, the type of horses and distribution of cervical lesions detected. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Horses undergoing cervical CT and CT myelography from June 2013 to February 2014 were reviewed. The horses were anaesthetised in left lateral recumbency using continuous intravenous anaesthesia. A Philips Brilliance Big Bore 16 slice scanner and a custom made equine CT table (Solving, Finland) were used. Results Cervical CT was performed on 16 horses, 11 of which also had CT myelography: 12 Warmblood, 2 ponies, 1 Standardbred and 1 Paint Horse. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, and in weight from 406 to 670?kg. Presenting complaints were: neurological symptoms (n?=?8), abnormal head/neck position (n?=?5), forelimb lameness (n?=?4), Horners syndrome (n?=?1). In all cases (n?=?16) the cervical spine from the skull to C7 could be imaged, in 3 cases T1 was imaged and in one case T3. Significant lesions were detected in 14 horses. The sites of the most significant lesions were: C4?C5 (n?=?3), C5?C6 (n?=?2), C6?C7 (n?=?5) and C7?T1 (n?=?2), cervical stenosis C5?T2 (n?=?1) and muscle injury (n?=?1). Length of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 70?min (median 60?min), with one complicated recovery. Conclusions Cervical CT and CT myelography can be performed in large adult horses. CT may be the future gold standard to evaluate equine cervical lesions. Further studies are needed.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Use of indication-specific CT protocols and adjustment of scan parameters to decrease radiation exposure may result in significant dose reduction. We implemented these strategies and compare pre- and post-implementation radiation dose in emergency department (ED) patients. Method This was a descriptive, retrospective study. Patients older than 15 years who had undergone emergency CT examinations of the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis and abdominopelvic region in periods before and after dose-reduction implementation were included. The primary outcome was volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length products (DLP). Results There were 786 studies in the pre-implementation (group 1) and 955 studies in the post-implementation (group 2) periods. Radiation dose from all CT types significantly reduced in the post-implementation period. Average CTDIvol for head, chest, abdomen, pelvis and abdominopelvic region (doses during pre-implementation period in parentheses) were 51.5 (109), 8.1 (30.4), 13.1 (41.8), 11 (38), 11.2 (41.8) mGy, respectively. Average DLP was also significantly lower (pre-implementation dose in parentheses) in all CT types, which were 943 (2232), 324 (2517), 944 (5605), 280 (4024), 809 (7118) mGy?cm, respectively. Patients' age, gender, body mass index and size were not significantly different between the two groups. Image quality decreased but almost all examinations received an acceptable diagnostic subjective image quality. Conclusion Simple methods could help significantly reduce CT radiation exposure in ED patients while maintaining an acceptable level of diagnostic image quality.

AB  - The assessment of residual brain function in the vegetative state, is extremely difficult and depends frequently on subjective interpretations of observed spontaneous and volitional behaviors. For those patients who retain peripheral motor function, rigorous behavioral assessment supported by structural imaging and electrophysiology is usually sufficient to establish a patient's level of wakefulness and awareness. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that, in some patients, damage to the peripheral motor system may prevent overt responses to command, even though the cognitive ability to perceive and understand such commands may remain intact. Advances in functional neuroimaging suggest a novel solution to this problem; in several recent cases, so-called ?activation? studies have been used to identify residual cognitive function and even conscious awareness in patients who are assumed to be vegetative, yet retain cognitive abilities that have evaded detection using standard clinical methods.

AB  - Abstract The stability of orthopedic implants is governed by the interaction between the material's surface and bone cells. Nanosized structures seem to be promising in supporting the osseointegration of total joint replacements. In order to analyze whether nanostructured titanium surfaces, as generated by a short-pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser irradiation process developed in the aeronautics and space industry as a ?cold ablation? process, can be useful for orthopedic applications, their impact on bone cells is evaluated in vitro. Cell spreading and morphology on nanostructured titanium niobium nitride or titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces are comparable to osteoblast behavior on corresponding untreated titanium or cells grown on cover glass. However, on the nanostructured surfaces cell numbers appear to be reduced. Nonetheless, cell viability is not affected by laser pretreatment. Interestingly, osteoblast proliferation on nanostructured titanium is inhibited to the benefit of an increased production of osteoblast-specific proteins such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or procollagen. Furthermore, an enhanced mineralization of cells grown on nanostructured surfaces is confirmed in terms of an elevated hydroxyapatite deposition. Laser irradiation leads to an additional nanostructure on microstructured titanium surfaces and might positively affect the biocompatibility and ingrowth of prostheses made from the corresponding biomaterials.
