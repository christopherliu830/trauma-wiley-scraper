AB  - Abstract Of the 248 soldiers killed in the 1985 crash of a chartered Army jetliner at Gander, Newfoundland, most (189) came from a single Army battalion. In order to gain a better understanding of psychological aspects of group adjustment to collective traumatic loss, a naturalistic case study was made of this battalion over the 6-month period following the crash. Of special interest was the problem of integrating new replacements, and the role of these replacements in helping or impeding group recovery. Extensive interview and observational data were collected at approximately monthly intervals. Results suggest four relatively distinct psycho-social phases of unit recovery, each lasting about 4?6 weeks: (1) Numb Dedication; (2) Anger-Betrayal; (3) Stoic Resolve; and (4) Integration. A reconstitution plan that intermixed replacements with veterans facilitated integration and unit recovery; veterans quickly accepted newcomers as allies in adversity. Despite some individual differences, the general response pattern indicates a group-level phenomenon of adaptation to collective trauma that includes both intrusion and denial. This model of group recovery from trauma calls attention to social aspects of the grief process, and suggests interactions between individual and social factors that may influence adjustment to traumatic loss.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy in treating canine adrenal tumours with vascular invasion. Methods A single-arm clinical study was performed. The dogs underwent total body computed tomography, brain and abdomen magnetic resonance imaging and endocrine assay. Adrenal masses were classified as cortisol-secreting adrenal tumour or non-secreting adrenal tumour. Radiotherapy treatments were delivered by hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy via a linear accelerator. The overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan?Meier method. The overall response and radio-toxicity effects were determined. Results Nine dogs were enrolled. Three dogs were affected by cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours and the remaining dogs had non-secreting adrenal tumours. The prescribed doses ranged from 30 to 45?Gy in three or five consecutive daily fractions. The median overall survival time was 1030 days, and the overall mean reduction of the diameter and volume were ~32 and 30% respectively. The endocrine profile normalised in two dogs with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours. Radio-toxicities were mild and self-limiting. Seven deaths were recorded during the follow-up period and two dogs were censored. Clinical Significance Hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy should be considered as a feasible and effective therapeutic option for adrenal tumours with vascular invasion.

AB  - Objective? To determine the clinical course in dogs with aural cholesteatoma. Study Design? Case series. Animals? Dogs (n=20) with aural cholesteatoma. Methods? Case review (1998?2007). Results? Twenty dogs were identified. Clinical signs other than those of chronic otitis externa included head tilt (6 dogs), unilateral facial palsy (4), pain on opening or inability to open the mouth (4), and ataxia (3). Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 19 dogs, abnormalities included osteoproliferation (13 dogs), lysis of the bulla (12), expansion of the bulla (11), bone lysis in the squamous or petrosal portion of the temporal bone (4) and enlargement of associated lymph nodes (7). Nineteen dogs had total ear canal ablation?lateral bulla osteotomy or ventral bulla osteotomy with the intent to cure; 9 dogs had no further signs of middle ear disease whereas 10 had persistent or recurrent clinical signs. Risk factors for recurrence after surgery were inability to open the mouth or neurologic signs on admission and lysis of any portion of the temporal bone on CT imaging. Dogs admitted with neurologic signs or inability to open the mouth had a median survival of 16 months. Conclusions? Early surgical treatment of aural cholesteatoma may be curative. Recurrence after surgery is associated with advanced disease, typically indicated by inability to open the jaw, neurologic disease, or bone lysis on CT imaging. Clinical Relevance? Presence of aural cholesteatoma may affect the prognosis for successful surgical treatment of middle ear disease.

AB  - Currently the most sensitive method for localizing lung cancers in central airways is autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) in combination with white light bronchoscopy (WLB). The diagnostic accuracy of WLB + AFB for high grade dysplasia (HGD) and carcinoma in situ is variable depending on physician's experience. When WLB + AFB are operated at high diagnostic sensitivity, the associated diagnostic specificity is low. Raman spectroscopy probes molecular vibrations and gives highly specific, fingerprint-like spectral features and has high accuracy for tissue pathology classification. In this study we present the use of a real-time endoscopy Raman spectroscopy system to improve the specificity. A spectrum is acquired within 1 second and clinical data are obtained from 280 tissue sites (72 HGDs/malignant lesions, 208 benign lesions/normal sites) in 80 patients. Using multivariate analyses and waveband selection methods on the Raman spectra, we have demonstrated that HGD and malignant lung lesions can be detected with high sensitivity (90%) and good specificity (65%).

AB  - Abstract Ischemia is the defined pathway leading to steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON). Early detection of ischemic condition may help predict later ON occurrence. Bone marrow perfusion function evaluation by perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a unique modality for this application. Twenty-five adult male New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS) were administrated for ON induction based on a published protocol. T1-weighted and fat suppression T2-weighted MR imaging (conventional MRI) were performed for ON lesion detection based on the abnormal signal in the proximal femora at week 0 as the baseline (before LPS injection), and week 1 and week 2 after MPS injection. At the same time, the blood perfusion function in the proximal femora was measured by perfusion MRI. Maximum enhancement (ME)?an index of MRI perfusion function was analyzed. After MRI scanning, the proximal femora were prepared histopathologically for ON lesion analysis. The rabbit with bilateral histopathological ON lesions was defined as an ON+ rabbit and included in the ON+ group evaluated at week 1 and week 2, respectively, and the rabbit without ON lesions in bilateral femora was classified into the ON? group. For the underlying mechanism of perfusion change, the extravascular marrow fat cells were measured and the intravascular endothelium inflammation injury indicator of tissue factor (TF) expression and thrombus formation were detected. In ON+ group, ME in perfusion MRI showed a significant decrease at week 1 and week 2 as compared with the baseline (p?<?0.01). There was a more than 50% decrease in ME at week 1 in ON+ group; whereas there were no detectable ON lesions by conventional MRI at week 1, though 93% (14/15) rabbits could be detected at week 2 in ON+ group. In ON? group, ME showed a slight decrease at week 1 (less than 30%), and nearly recovered to normal at week 2 as compared with the baseline. Histological results showed a much larger average marrow fat area and more severe marrow blood sinusoids compression from surrounding crowded fat cells, and stronger positive TF expression in marrow endothelium and more thrombus formation in ON+ rabbits than ON? rabbits. This study demonstrated that functional perfusion MRI could predict development of steroid-associated ON. Our experimental data suggested that perfusion MRI might be a sensitive noninvasive modality for monitoring steroid-associated ON in patients. ? 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary The vestibulocochlear organ is a multi-part structure that consists of the external, middle, and inner ear. Given that it can be readily observed on physical examination, the external ear is the focus of this chapter. The purpose of the external ear is to funnel sound toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. This facilitates the special sense of hearing. Although ear shape and structure vary depending upon breed standard, the function of the organ is essentially the same. In order to preserve the sense of hearing, the pinnae need to operate independently of one another, and the external ear needs to be open, as opposed to stenotic. The ear canal also needs to be free of excessive hair, cerumen, or other debris. Abnormal aural presentations are common in clinical practice and include both those problems that are limited to the pinnae and those that involve the external ear canal. Aural hematomas, infestation with Sarcoptes and Notoedres mange mites, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affect primarily the pinnae. By contrast, otitis externa involves inflammation of the external ear canal. Otitis externa is a frequent occurrence in both dogs and cats. Patients with long, droopy ears, excessive ear canal hair, or extensive swimming and/or bathing histories may be predisposed due to the potential for reduced aeration and increased moisture within the ears themselves. Patients with otitis may present with malodorous ears and irritation. Clinical signs frequently include head shaking, pawing, or scratching at the ears, and/or reluctance to allow the clinician to perform otoscopy. Otoscopy and cytology are important diagnostic tools that allow for reliable characterization of aural debris. Interpretation of aural cytology requires the clinician to recognize what constitutes normal resident flora of the ear canal. Bacterial and fungal overgrowth versus infection are important distinctions to make. Culture and drug susceptibility profiles may be indicated as follow-up diagnostic aids, particularly in cases of chronic or recurrent otitis externa, or when the patient's response to therapy is poor. The clinician must also make every attempt to identify the primary cause of aural disease. Ear infections are typically the result of other underlying conditions, including allergic skin disease, autoimmune disease, metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, and parasitic infestation. Without managing these primary causes, otitis externa is likely to recur.

AB  - Cartilage loss is irreversible, and to date, no effective pharmacotherapies are available to protect or regenerate cartilage. Quantitative prestructural/compositional MR imaging techniques have been developed to characterize the cartilage matrix quality at a stage where abnormal findings are early and potentially reversible, allowing intervention to halt disease progression. The goal of this article is to critically review currently available technologies, present the basic concept behind these techniques, but also to investigate their suitability as imaging biomarkers including their validity, reproducibility, risk prediction and monitoring of therapy. Moreover, we highlighted important clinical applications. This review article focuses on the currently most relevant and clinically applicable technologies, such as T2 mapping, T2*, T1?, delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC), sodium imaging and glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST). To date, most information is available for T2 and T1? mapping. dGEMRIC has also been used in multiple clinical studies, although it requires Gd contrast administration. Sodium imaging and gagCEST are promising technologies but are dependent on high field strength and sophisticated software and hardware. Level of Evidence: 5 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:949?965

AB  - Abstract Objective Primarily to determine mid-term functional outcome for patients with distal radius fracture (DRF) and to compare this between operative and conservatively managed patients. Secondarily to examine for differences in age, gender and number of instability factors between management groups. Methods Eligible patients (age 18?years or more, closed DRF managed to completion of care within Monash Health), presenting between 1 January and 31 December 2016. Completion of the patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) questionnaire was sought at 6?12 months post-injury. Management was noted (operative or conservative). Age, sex and number of defined instability factors present (dorsal angulation >20°, intra-articular fracture, associated ulna fracture, dorsal comminution, radial shortening >2 mm) are reported and compared between management groups. Results Of 369 eligible patients, 199 (54%) completed a PRWE. Median age was 60?years (interquartile range [IQR] 45?71), 150 (75%) were women, median number of instability factors present was 2 (IQR 1?4) and 45 (23%) underwent operative management. Difference in PRWE scores between operative and conservatively managed patients was not significant (20 [IQR 7?36] vs 16 [IQR 5?35]). Differences in age and gender between management groups were not significant. Significantly more in the operative group had presence of four or more instability factors (44% [95% confidence interval 30?60] vs 20% [14?27]). Conclusion The mid-term median PRWE score was 18 (IQR 5?36). This was not significantly different between operative and conservatively managed patients. Operation was more likely when four or more instability factors were present.

AB  - Objective To review the clinical features, treatments, complications, and outcomes of horses with traumatic orbital fractures. Study design Retrospective study. Sample Population Eighteen horses with confirmed orbital fractures. Procedures Medical records of horses presenting with orbital fractures between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Signalment, etiology of fracture, clinical signs, fracture descriptions, diagnostic imaging, treatments, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. Results Eighteen horses presented with orbital fractures resulting from rearing in a confined space (n = 5), being kicked (4), colliding with a stationary object (3), and unknown trauma (6). Radiography and computed tomography were effective at classifying fractures and evaluating sinus/nasal involvement. Epistaxis/sinusitis were associated with fractures of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (n = 3) and comminuted fractures of multiple bones (5). Seventeen fractures required treatment, with fifteen receiving a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgery included reduction of large bony fragments (n = 8), removal of small fragments (12), stabilization with a wire implant (1), and sinus trephination and lavage (5). Factors contributing to a favorable outcome included: globe retention (n = 16), vision (14), comfort (15), cosmesis (9), and return to previous function (13). Conclusions Horses sustaining orbital fractures treated promptly with medical and surgical therapy have a favorable prognosis for return to function and cosmesis. Fractures affecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone are unlikely to involve the sinus/nasal cavities. Epistaxis and sinusitis warrant more aggressive therapy and decrease functional and cosmetic outcome.

AB  - Background and Objectives Scar rehabilitation is a complex process that incorporates medical, surgical, and physical therapeutic measures to best restore function and visual normalcy. Lasers have emerged as essential tools in the management of scars, with devices available to address scar size, dyschromia, and contour irregularities. As different lasers treat these different features, multi-laser, same session therapeutic approaches may offer a more comprehensive approach to scar revision. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the effect of a combinatorial, same session treatment with intense pulsed light (IPL) and fractional ablative CO2 as compared to single laser treatment with fractional ablative CO2 laser alone or control in the treatment of mature hypertrophic scars. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, randomized controlled trial, enrolled 23 healthy adults with large (>100?cm2) hypertrophic scars who were randomized to one of three treatment arms: (i) IPL and CO2 ablative fractional laser (AFL), (ii) CO2 AFL alone, and (iii) control (no laser treatment). Subjects underwent a total of four treatment sessions at 6?8-week intervals with follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months following the last treatment session. Primary endpoints included blinded scoring of before and after photographs via the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS). Secondary endpoints included the Patient-Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Results As compared to control and CO2 AFL laser alone, the combination of CO2 AFL and IPL demonstrated statistically significant improvement across a greater number of scar domains, as assessed by the MSS. 100% of subjects in both treatment groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the POSAS scale after the series of four treatment sessions. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion Treatment with combined IPL and CO2 AFL demonstrated higher average improvements across the majority of assessed scar domains, as compared to both control and CO2 laser alone. The difference was not statistically significant in overall MSS score as expected due to the role of CO2 as the main source of improvement. However, only the combination group had statistically significant improvement in both color and texture. These findings support the assertion that a multi-photo-thermolytic approach with combined IPL and CO2 AFL can have a positive impact on the treatment of hypertrophic scars by using multiple wavelengths to maximize laser-skin interactions in targeting the different chromophores expressed in scar tissue.

AB  - Abstract The BrainMap database is a community resource that curates peer-reviewed, coordinate-based human neuroimaging literature. By pairing the results of neuroimaging studies with their relevant meta-data, BrainMap facilitates coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) of the neuroimaging literature en masse or at the level of experimental paradigm, clinical disease, or anatomic location. Initially dedicated to the functional, task-activation literature, BrainMap is now expanding to include voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies in a separate sector, titled: BrainMap VBM. VBM is a whole-brain, voxel-wise method that measures significant structural differences between or within groups which are reported as standardized, peak x?y?z coordinates. Here we describe BrainMap VBM, including the meta-data structure, current data volume, and automated reverse inference functions (region-to-disease profile) of this new community resource. CBMA offers a robust methodology for retaining true-positive and excluding false-positive findings across studies in the VBM literature. As with BrainMap's functional database, BrainMap VBM may be synthesized en masse or at the level of clinical disease or anatomic location. As a use-case scenario for BrainMap VBM, we illustrate a trans-diagnostic data-mining procedure wherein we explore the underlying network structure of 2,002 experiments representing over 53,000 subjects through independent components analysis (ICA). To reduce data-redundancy effects inherent to any database, we demonstrate two data-filtering approaches that proved helpful to ICA. Finally, we apply hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) to measure network- and disease-specificity. This procedure distinguished psychiatric from neurological diseases. We invite the neuroscientific community to further exploit BrainMap VBM with other modeling approaches.

AB  - Abstract Background Clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolic events (uVTE) detected during routine imaging pose a management challenge due to limited knowledge about their clinical significance. Unsuspected VTE are often referred as ?asymptomatic?, ?incidental? or ?clinically silent/occult? VTE. Objective Understand the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of uVTE in children. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The search criteria included controlled vocabulary and keywords for VTE, incidental findings, and children (ages ≤21 years). Results Among 10,875 articles, 51 studies (7597 children with 758 uVTE) were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, I2 96%; p <.0001. Unsuspected VTE were diagnosed in two settings: first, asymptomatic VTE (aVTE) diagnosed through surveillance imaging for VTE [45 studies; n=5869; aVTE: 715, pooled frequency:19%, 95% CI:13- 24%]; second, incidental VTE (iVTE) diagnosed during imaging performed for indications without primary suspicion for VTE [6 studies; n=2460; iVTE: 43]. Majority (94%) of aVTE were associated with central venous lines (CVL). Non-CVL settings included post-spinal surgery, post-splenectomy, trauma, nephrotic syndrome and newborns. In general, aVTE were reported to have a benign clinical course, were mostly transient, and resolved without intervention and with few immediate or long-term functional complications. Incidental VTE were primarily detected in children with cancer and ranged from tumor-associated thrombi to pulmonary embolism (PE) with insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions about their management. Conclusion Clinically uVTE were predominantly diagnosed with CVL and their outcomes were generally favorable implying limited benefit of routine surveillance and thromboprophylaxis. Prospective research is needed to clarify the optimal management of iVTE.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorders (BD) are characterized by emotion and cognitive dysregulation. Mapping deficits in the neurocircuitry of cognitive-affective regulation allows for potential identification of intervention targets. This study used functional MRI data in BD patients and healthy controls during performance on a task requiring cognitive and inhibitory control superimposed on affective images, assessing cognitive and affective interference. Methods Functional MRI data were collected from 39 BD patients and 36 healthy controls during performance on the Multi-Source Interference Task overlaid on images from the International Affective Picture System (MSIT-IAPS). Analyses examined patterns of activation in a priori regions implicated in cognitive and emotional processing. Functional connectivity to the anterior insula during task performance was also examined, given this region's role in emotion-cognition integration. Results BD patients showed significantly less activation during cognitive interference trials in inferior parietal lobule, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, mid-cingulate, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex regardless of affective valence. BD patients showed deviations in functional connectivity with anterior insula in regions of the default mode and frontoparietal control networks during negatively valenced cognitive interference trials. Conclusions Our findings show disruptions in cognitive regulation and inhibitory control in BD patients in the presence of irrelevant affective distractors. Results of this study suggest one pathway to dysregulation in BD is through inefficient integration of affective and cognitive information, and highlight the importance of developing interventions that target emotion-cognition integration in BD.

AB  - In this paper, destructiveness is approached as a multi-dimensional phenomenon where the mental health perspective addresses only one of these dimensions. An attempt is made to locate this phenomenon in the context of epistemological and societal considerations. Critical of mono-dimensional explanations based on causal-reductive epistemology, the paper instead proposes the idea of an ?ecology of destructiveness?, according to which mental health professionals cannot possibly continue to assume the role of detached observers. The ordinariness and archetypal fascination of destructiveness are discussed as preventing the psychologizing and pathologizing of it. In addition, it is suggested that ?destructiveness may be a tragic facet of the human condition?, without this implying any justification of it. Based on my work with a group of Bosnian ex-camp prisoners, some basic principles of how one can work with survivors of atrocities are derived and discussed. A central feature of this work is the attempt to create an appropriate therapeutic context within which a ?therapeutic presence? and ?therapeutic witnessing? can be developed. Finally, the relevance of Jungian insights to this kind of work is reviewed and the emergence of new types of defences of the self is identified.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

AB  - Summary In this pictorial essay, we showcase the imaging and pathological findings of a variety of giant breast lesions. Some lesions such as lipomas and hamartomas contain fibrous, glandular and lipomatous tissues and can have characteristic mammographic appearances. Other lesions (e.g. simple cysts, fibroepithelial lesions and some malignancies) may be mammographically indistinguishable and ultrasound (US) may be helpful in further characterisation, for example, by demonstrating posterior enhancement with simple cysts, cystic and solid components in papillary lesions, internal septations on haematomas and abscesses, solid homogeneity or heterogeneity in fibroepithelial lesions and increased vascularity in neoplastic, inflammatory or infective lesions. A diagnostic needle biopsy may be performed in some cases; however, with larger and heterogeneous lesions, there is an increased possibility of diagnostic inaccuracy due to limited sampling, such that full excision of the lesion may be advisable to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To perform a retrospective audit of cases of uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) at The Canberra Hospital and review of recent literature reporting pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of UAVM aiming to devise a diagnostic and treatment protocol to optimise pregnancy post UAVM. Methods: A retrospective audit of cases of UAVM at the Canberra Hospital from a prospectively managed patient database was performed. A search of the electronic database PubMed, for articles between 2000?2011 relating to pregnancy post UAVM. Individual case studies were analysed separately to case series. Results: The study included 28 individual studies and five case series (61 women). Average age was 29.5 ± 6.7 (range 18?42). Most women (24, 85.7%, 100% in case series) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding; 11 (41%) individuals presented post interruption of pregnancy. All women had had a previous pregnancy (mean gravidity 3.1 ± 3.1, range 1?15 for case studies) and only four women (14.2 %) had no history of uterine trauma. Only one woman (3.6 %) did not have any ultrasound and most women underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography (20, 71.4% in case studies; 61, 83.6% in case series). Of the women, 72 (53.6 % of case studies, 78.1 % of case series) were treated with uterine artery embolisation, seven (25%) were treated expectantly. A total of 63 pregnancies occurred post treatment, seven (13.9%) ending in miscarriage. Average time to conceive post diagnosis was 19 months ± 16.3 (range 2?72). A total of 54 healthy infants were born to mothers post AVM diagnosis. Conclusion: UAVM are likely to exist on a continuum with other pregnancy related pathologies, such as sub involution of the placental bed, making a single best diagnostic and treatment plan difficult. However, this study shows that successful uncomplicated pregnancy is achievable for women after the diagnosis of UAVM.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Junior doctors are typically responsible for requesting and interpreting diagnostic imaging studies. European studies have highlighted the paucity of radiology teaching leading to junior doctors feeling underprepared for clinical practice involving radiology. There is a lack of published data on the experiences of Australian medical students and junior doctors. This study aimed to describe the experiences of interns in Western Australia to establish whether they felt prepared for clinical practice by the radiology teaching they received at medical school and beyond. Methods This cross-sectional observational study involved a needs analysis questionnaire. The study population included all interns currently employed by Fiona Stanley Hospital (n = 121). Results Radiology teaching at medical school was reportedly mostly informal and infrequent. More than half felt this was inadequate (52%). Current teaching was also reportedly infrequent and 31% reported receiving no radiology teaching in their current rotation. The interns reported requesting high volumes of diagnostic imaging with 66% reporting requesting imaging once a day or more frequently. The overwhelming majority stated their clinical practice would benefit from additional teaching in radiology (98%). Conclusion This study has demonstrated a paucity of radiology teaching provided to interns in a large Australian teaching hospital. As they request and interpret high volumes of diagnostic imaging, skills in this domain are paramount in the provision of safe, effective and timely patient care. The results are being used in the design and implementation of a high-quality radiology teaching programme to improve junior doctors? skill and develop the radiologist?clinical referrer interface.
