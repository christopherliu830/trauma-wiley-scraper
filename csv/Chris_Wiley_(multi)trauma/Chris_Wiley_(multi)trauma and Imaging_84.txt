AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intracranial hypertension develops in only some patients with lateral sinus thrombosis (LST), for reasons that are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible association between patency of the unaffected sinus and clinical presentation of unilateral LST. METHODS A computerized search identified patients with LST, hospitalized in Soroka Medical Center. Patients with signs of increased intracranial pressure (iICP) and those with normal intracranial pressure (nICP) were compared. CT venography or MR venography confirmed the diagnosis, located the thrombosis, and determined the dominant lateral sinus (LS). Diameters of the right and left LSs (the occluded and unaffected) were compared to the diameter of the distal superior sagittal sinus (SSS). RESULTS Of the 50 patients identified, 30 had iICP and 20 nICP. The dominant LS was the right one in 39 (78%) and the left one in 8 (16%); 3 (6%) had equal LS dominance. The dominant sinus was affected in 32 (70%) and the non-dominant in 15 (30%) patients. iICP was detected in 28/32 (81%) of patients with the dominant side affected, and 3/15 (20%) of those with non-dominant thrombotic sinus (P = .002). The unaffected sinus was narrower in iICP patients (size relative to SSS diameter = 43% in iICP vs. 86% in nICP [P = .0002]; size grading, according to Farb's method was 1.86 in the iICP vs. 3.57 in the nICP group [P = .0001]). CONCLUSIONS Thrombosis was more common in the dominant LS. Unaffected LS patency appears to be associated with the development of increased ICP.

AB  - Abstract ?Community mobilization? in the Community Trials Project refers to organizing community members to support and implement policies to reduce alcohol-involved trauma. This paper defines the conceptual model of mobilization used in the project. In evaluating the project, we were guided by the conceptual model and we used structured materials from interviews with local staff in all three experimental communities; we found that the overall goal of mobilization (implementation of policies) was achieved. Additional observations based on naturalistic case studies of the communities include: (1) the importance of an established research base, (2) the varying role and problematic nature of coalitions, (3) the strategic advantage of early project support r among the general population, (4) the role played by key leaders in mobilization, (5) the advantages of a multi-component design, and (6) the key role played by media advocacy.

AB  - Abstract Aim Surgical treatment of high anal fistulas is associated with the potential risk of faecal incontinence and recurrence. The primary aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of three-dimensional endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) in the assessment of height and type of anal fistulas, compared to the intra-operative findings (gold standard). The secondary aim was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of 3D-EAUS. Method The study design was a prospective analysis of retrospective data. 299 patients (202 men), mean age 45.3 years, who underwent surgery for anal fistulas, were included. All patients were preoperatively assessed by 3D-EAUS. Two readers independently reviewed the volumes to determine the type and height of fistulas. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, proportion of agreements and Cohen's kappa coefficient (?) were calculated for both examiners. Ultrasound findings were compared with intra-operative data (reference standard), evaluated blindly by the surgeons. Results At surgery, 201 (67%) were transsphincteric, 49 (16%) suprasphincteric, 47 (16%) intersphincteric and two (1%) extrasphincteric fistulas. Intra-operatively, 177 (59%) were low and 122 (41%) high fistulas. The overall accuracy of 3D-EAUS was 91% for fistula type (271/299 fistulas: 97% transsphincteric, 100% intersphincteric, 57% suprasphincteric, 0% extrasphincteric) and 92% for fistula height (275/299 fistulas: 80% high and 100% low). Both readers reported very good agreement with surgery in the assessment of fistula type (proportion of agreement 0.88, ? = 0.89) and height (proportion of agreement 0.90, ? = 0.91). Conclusions 3D-EAUS is an accurate and reproducible modality for the assessment of type and height of anal fistulas.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the development of a facial expression tool differentiating pain-free cats from those in acute pain. METHODS Observers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats were asked to identify if they were in pain or not. From facial images, anatomical landmarks were identified and distances between these were mapped. Selected distances underwent statistical analysis to identify features discriminating pain-free and painful cats. Additionally, thumbnail photographs were reviewed by two experts to identify discriminating facial features between the groups. RESULTS Observers (n = 68) had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13% of observers being able to discriminate more than 80% of painful cats. Analysis of 78 facial landmarks and 80 distances identified six significant factors differentiating pain-free and painful faces including ear position and areas around the mouth/muzzle. Standardised mouth and ear distances when combined showed excellent discrimination properties, correctly differentiating pain-free and painful cats in 98% of cases. Expert review supported these findings and a cartoon-type picture scale was developed from thumbnail images. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial investigation into facial features of painful and pain-free cats suggests potentially good discrimination properties of facial images. Further testing is required for development of a clinical tool.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background information Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell?cell and cell?matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6?12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Results Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. Conclusions We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes.

AB  - ABSTRACT A total of 181 dermatologically healthy pet cats from 177 different households, attending a veterinary clinic, were sampled for the presence of dermatophytes by a modified MacKenzie hair brush technique. Microsporum canis was the only dermatophyte recovered and was isolated from four cats (2.2 per cent) from four different households. In addition to clinical details, owners were questioned about the environment and management of all the cats sampled. The data regarding the cats from which M canis was recovered showed little variation from that of the culture-negative cats except that all four cats were from multi-cat (more than two cats) households, whereas only 35 per cent of the culture-negative cats were from a similar environment. The viability of M canis in infected feline hairs stored at room temperature was maintained for between 13 and 18 months.

AB  - Purpose To introduce newly developed MR elastography (MRE)-based dual-saturation imaging and dual-sensitivity motion encoding schemes to directly measure in vivo skull?brain motion, and to study the skull?brain coupling in volunteers with these approaches. Methods Six volunteers were scanned with a high-performance compact 3T-MRI scanner. The skull?brain MRE images were obtained with a dual-saturation imaging where the skull and brain motion were acquired with fat- and water-suppression scans, respectively. A dual-sensitivity motion encoding scheme was applied to estimate the heavily wrapped phase in skull by the simultaneous acquisition of both low- and high-sensitivity phase during a single MRE exam. The low-sensitivity phase was used to guide unwrapping of the high-sensitivity phase. The amplitude and temporal phase delay of the rigid-body motion between the skull and brain was measured, and the skull?brain interface was visualized by slip interface imaging (SII). Results Both skull and brain motion can be successfully acquired and unwrapped. The skull?brain motion analysis demonstrated the motion transmission from the skull to the brain is attenuated in amplitude and delayed. However, this attenuation (%) and delay (rad) were considerably greater with rotation (59?±?7%, 0.68?±?0.14 rad) than with translation (92?±?5%, 0.04?±?0.02 rad). With SII the skull?brain slip interface was not completely evident, and the slip pattern was spatially heterogeneous. Conclusion This study provides a framework for acquiring in vivo voxel-based skull and brain displacement using MRE that can be used to characterize the skull?brain coupling system for understanding of mechanical brain protection mechanisms, which has potential to facilitate risk management for future injury.

AB  - Abstract Understanding near infrared light propagation in tissue is vital for designing next generation optical brain imaging devices. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide a controlled mechanism to characterize and evaluate contributions of diverse near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor configurations and parameters. In this study, we developed a multilayer adult digital head model under both healthy and clinical settings and assessed light-tissue interaction through MC simulations in terms of partial differential pathlength, mean total optical pathlength, diffuse reflectance, detector light intensity and spatial sensitivity profile of optical measurements. The model incorporated four layers: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal-fluid and cerebral cortex with and without a customizable lesion for modeling hematoma of different sizes and depths. The effect of source-detector separation (SDS) on optical measurements' sensitivity to brain tissue was investigated. Results from 1330 separate simulations [(4 lesion volumes ? 4 lesion depths for clinical +3 healthy settings) ? 7 SDS ? 10 simulation = 1330)] each with 100 million photons indicated that selection of SDS is critical to acquire optimal measurements from the brain and recommended SDS to be 25 to 35?mm depending on the wavelengths to obtain optical monitoring of the adult brain function. The findings here can guide the design of future NIRS probes for functional neuroimaging and clinical diagnostic systems.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: To describe the presentation, clinical, ultrasonographic and endoscopic features associated with a defect in the tarsal sheath wall, to define the cavity created and to describe a method of treatment. Hypothesis: So called ?false thoroughpins? can be caused by defects in the tarsal sheath wall creating a one way valve effect, removal of which could be therapeutic. Methods: Case records and diagnostic images of horses with synoviocoeles associated with the tarsal sheath were reviewed retrospectively and follow-up information obtained. Results: Synoviocoeles were diagnosed in 15 horses. All were managed similarly and 10 horses had clinical resolution and returned to work. Conclusion: Terminology previously used to describe lesions involving the tarsal sheath does not define accurately the condition described and the term synoviocoele is recommended. Endoscopic enlargement of the sheath wall defect produced good clinical results in 10/15 horses. Potential relevance: Clinicians should include synoviocoele in the list of differential diagnoses of fluid filled cavities associated with the tarsal sheath and should consider endoscopic surgery as a treatment modality.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the clinical features, radiological characteristics and surgical results of degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS). Methods:? One hundred and twelve cases of DLS treated surgically from June 2001 to February 2006 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical features, characteristics of nerve root compression and imaging presentations. According to the preoperative clinical manifestations and imaging findings, different surgical modalities were performed, including simple nerve decompression and decompression with short or long posterior fusion (less or more than three segments, respectively). Results:? The mean age of 47 male and 65 female patients was 54.7 years. Clinical manifestations included lower back pain (76.8%), radiculopathy (79.5%) and claudication (48.2%). Plain lumbar radiograph showed right scoliosis in 87 and left scoliosis in the other 25 cases; the Cobb angle was 10°?46°; the apex of scoliosis mostly located at L3 (48.2%); L3 and L4 nerve roots were usually compressed on the concave side and L5 and S1 nerve roots on the convex side. The Cobb angle and physiologic lordosis angle of patients who underwent multi-segment (>3 segments) fusion improved to a greater extent than did that of patients who had simple decompression without fusion. A mean 5.7-year follow-up showed that the average improvement in Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores was 32.6, 26.3 and 13.5 for long segment fusion, short segment fusion and simple decompression without fusion, respectively. Conclusion:? Decompression surgery with or without fusion, the main purpose of which is to relieve nerve root compression and stabilize the spinal column, is an effective treatment for chronic DLS. The treatment should be individualized according to the patient's age, general and economic factors, severity of deformity and other coexisting lumbar degenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract Cellular studies indicate that endocannabinoid type-1 retrograde signaling plays a major role in synaptic plasticity. Disruption of these processes by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could produce alterations either in structural and functional brain connectivity or in their association in cannabis (CB) users. Graph theoretic structural and functional networks were generated with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional imaging in 37 current CB users and 31 healthy non-users. The primary outcome measures were coupling between structural and functional connectivity, global network characteristics, association between the coupling and network properties, and measures of rich-club organization. Structural?functional (SC?FC) coupling was globally preserved showing a positive association in current CB users. However, the users had disrupted associations between SC?FC coupling and network topological characteristics, most perturbed for shorter connections implying region-specific disruption by CB use. Rich-club analysis revealed impaired SC?FC coupling in the hippocampus and caudate of users. This study provides evidence of the abnormal SC?FC association in CB users. The effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local interconnections. Notably, the hippocampus and caudate specifically showed aberrant structural and functional coupling. These structures have high CB1 receptor density and may also be associated with changes in learning and habit formation that occur with chronic cannabis use.

AB  - Summary Vertebral fracture is usually the first osteoporotic fracture to occur and also the most common osteoporotic fracture, being present in 15% of women aged 50-59 years. Despite the clear clinical importance of vertebral fractures, they remain underdiagnosed in clinical practice. Good technique in performing spinal radiographs and a high level of observer experience in image interpretation are key to the reliable diagnosis of vertebral fractures. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is being utilized increasingly for vertebral fracture identification. Density and structural parameters obtained by volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT) can predict vertebral compressive strength ex vivo, and these parameters, together with nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) can also be applicable in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect minor acute or subacute vertebral fracture or re-fracture, determine fracture age, and distinguish between osteoporotic and neoplastic fracture with greater sensitivity than other imaging techniques.

Complications, including pathological fractures of the vertebrae and spinal cord compression, may cause severe pain, deformity and neurological sequelae. They may also have significant consequences for quality of life and prognosis for patients. For patients with known or newly diagnosed myeloma presenting with persistent back or radicular pain/weakness, early diagnosis of spinal myeloma disease is therefore essential to treat and prevent further deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging is the initial imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of spinal disease. Treatment of the underlying malignancy with systemic chemotherapy together with supportive bisphosphonate treatment reduces further vertebral damage. Additional interventions such as cement augmentation, radiotherapy, or surgery are often necessary to prevent, treat and control spinal complications. However, optimal management is dependent on the individual nature of the spinal involvement and requires careful assessment and appropriate intervention throughout. This article reviews the treatment and management options for spinal myeloma disease and highlights the value of defined pathways to enable the proper management of patients affected by it.

AB  - We evaluated the safety of ciprofloxacin administered in a dose of 15?25 mg/kg for 9?16 days, in a case series of 58 children who were between 8 months and 13 years of age. No arthropathy was observed during therapy and follow?up. Blinded evaluation of 22 pairs of nuclear magnetic resonance scans obtained before and between day 10 and 15 of therapy did not reveal any cartilage damage. After the first dose of ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg), serum fluoride levels increased at 12 h in 15 of 19 (79%) patients; 24?h urinary fluoride excretion was higher on day 7 compared with basal values in 16 of 18 (88.9%) patients. Height z scores of 53 patients at a mean of 22.5 months of follow?up were not significantly different from basal scores (p= 0.12). In conclusion, ciprofloxacin may be recommended for use in children for short duration when effective alternative antibacterials are unavailable. However, there is a need for further studies to evaluate the tissue accumulation of fluoride and its potential to cause toxic effects.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study In order for changes in lameness to be accurately and repeatably detected and recorded during diagnostic investigations, an objective measure of lameness is required. Objectives To ascertain whether an inertial sensor-based system can distinguish between a positive and negative response to diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot and objectively assess the effect of a positive response on the trot. Study design Restrospective clinical study. Methods Data obtained during lameness investigations undertaken between August 2011 and December 2012 in which either a palmar digital or abaxial sesamoid nerve block was performed were retrospectively reviewed. Response to diagnostic anaesthesia was categorised as positive (n = 14) or negative (n = 9) by one of 2 evaluators before analysis of kinematic data (i.e. blinded). Changes in maximum and minimum head difference (?HDMax and ?HDMin) and change in head movement asymmetry/change in pelvic movement asymmetry (?HMA/PMA, measure of asymmetry) allocated to each limb were calculated. A Kruskal?Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for ?HDMax, ?HDMin and ?HMA for the blocked limb to identify cut-off values to distinguish positive and negative responses to the block. Results Median ?HDMax and ?HDMin were significantly greater after a positive response to diagnostic anaesthesia (P<0.01). Change in head movement asymmetry allocated to the blocked limb and contralateral forelimb and ?PMA allocated to the contralateral hindlimb were significantly greater in the positive response group (P<0.05). Change in head movement asymmetry allocated to the blocked limb and ?HDMax and ?HDMin are useful diagnostic tests for identifying positive response to anaesthesia (area under the curve = 0.98, 0.83 and 0.96 respectively). Conclusions An inertial sensor-based system can identify a positive response to diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot. Symmetry of movement allocated to the blocked limb, contralateral forelimb and contralateral hindlimb significantly improve, and head movement significantly decreases in horses with a positive response to the block. Cut-off values for a positive response have been identified with good sensitivity and specificity. Forelimb lameness significantly affects contralateral hindlimb movement, which has implications for the investigation of multi-limb lameness.

AB  - Summary Focussed resuscitation and peri-resuscitation echocardiography is a relatively new and evolving application of point-of-care sonology that may significantly benefit those patients who have reversible causes of cardiac arrest. This chapter focusses on the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)-compliant use of sonography in cardiac arrest or pulseless states. Echocardiography in the peri-resuscitation setting may distinguish between two forms of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) with very different prognoses: If PEA with cardiac activity is identified, ultrasound can be extremely effective in identifying many of the more common reversible causes. The Focussed Echocardiography Examination in Life (FEEL) support examination offers an ACLS-compliant approach to the use of ultrasonography in cardiac arrest. In the workflow of the FEEL examination, sonographic images are obtained exclusively during the brief breaks from cardiac compressions for rhythm analysis and pulse check after the initial minimum of 2 minutes of uninterrupted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

AB  - Until the late-twentieth century, primary anatomical sciences education was relatively unenhanced by advanced technology and dependent on the mainstays of printed textbooks, chalkboard- and photographic projection-based classroom lectures, and cadaver dissection laboratories. But over the past three decades, diffusion of innovations in computer technology transformed the practices of anatomical education and research, along with other aspects of work and daily life. Increasing adoption of first-generation personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s paved the way for the first practical educational applications, and visionary anatomists foresaw the usefulness of computers for teaching. While early computers lacked high-resolution graphics capabilities and interactive user interfaces, applications with video discs demonstrated the practicality of programming digital multimedia linking descriptive text with anatomical imaging. Desktop publishing established that computers could be used for producing enhanced lecture notes, and commercial presentation software made it possible to give lectures using anatomical and medical imaging, as well as animations. Concurrently, computer processing supported the deployment of medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound, that were subsequently integrated into anatomy instruction. Following its public birth in the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web became the ubiquitous multimedia networking technology underlying the conduct of contemporary education and research. Digital video, structural simulations, and mobile devices have been more recently applied to education. Progressive implementation of computer-based learning methods interacted with waves of ongoing curricular change, and such technologies have been deemed crucial for continuing medical education reforms, providing new challenges and opportunities for anatomical sciences educators.
