AB  - Abstract Background This study aims to investigate the etiology and prognosis of spinal cord infarction (SCI). Methods Over a period of 16 years, we retrospectively analyzed 31 patients with SCI. Demographic features and symptom presentations were carefully documented. Etiology-specific MRI features, such as the length and distribution of the lesions and owl?s eyes sign, were recorded and analyzed to determine their associations with the clinical signs/symptoms. Results In total, seven patients had aortic or vertebral artery dissections. We divided the patients with SCI into two groups: those with or without vessel dissection. Among SCI patients, the onset age was younger, and the proportion of patients with long-segment lesions and posterior pattern involvement on axial view was higher in the group with dissection than in the group without dissection (all P < 0.05). The lesions were frequently located in the upper cervical or lower thoracic-lumbar regions, and the lengths of the lesions were associated with 1-month outcomes, suggesting that artery dissection may contribute to the longitudinal and posterior extension of SCI. In contrast, among patients without dissection, the range of longitudinal extensions of in spans of vertebral bodies was broader (range, 1?8). A higher proportion of patients had focal pain adjacent to the lesion (P = 0.05) and a poorer 1-month outcome (P = 0.04) in the long-segment lesion group than in the short-segment lesion group. Conclusions A detailed history and the use of modern imaging tools may help clinicians search for vessel dissection and other etiologies, evaluate the spatial extension of lesions in SCI, and predict prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Considerable ambiguity exists about the generators of the scalp recorded P300, despite a vast body of research employing a diverse range of methodologies. Previous investigations employing source localization techniques have been limited largely to equivalent current dipole models, with most studies identifying medial temporal and/or hippocampal sources, but providing little information about the contribution of other cortical regions to the generation of the scalp recorded P3. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 5 subjects using a 124-channel sensor array during the performance of a visuo-verbal Oddball task. Cortically constrained, MRI-guided boundary element modeling was used to identify the cortical generators of this target P3 in individual subjects. Cortical generators of the P3 were localized principally to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and surrounding superior parietal lobes (SPL) bilaterally in all subjects, though with some variability across subjects. Two subjects also showed activity in the lingual/inferior occipital gyrus and mid-fusiform gyrus. A group cortical surface was calculated by non-linear warping of each subject's segmented cortex followed by averaging and creation of a group mesh. Source activity identified across the group reflected the individual subject activations in the IPS and SPL bilaterally and in the lingual/inferior occipital gyrus primarily on the left. Activation of IPS and SPL is interpreted to reflect the role of this region in working memory and related attention processes and visuo-motor integration. The activity in left lingual/inferior occipital gyrus is taken to reflect activation of regions associated with modality-specific analysis of visual word forms. Hum.

AB  - Ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel is common. However, a rare form of ulnar neuropathy here is due to compression from an accessory muscle, the anconeus epitrochlearis. Reports in the literature regarding the details of this muscle's innervation are vague, so the aim of the present study was to characterize this anatomy more clearly. This was a combined review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from patients with an anconeus epitrochlearis and ulnar neuropathy and cadaveric dissections to characterize the innervation of this variant muscle. A review of 11 patients and three reports of ulnar neuropathy and an anconeus epitrochlearis in the literature revealed no MRI changes consistent with acute denervation of this muscle. However, in two cases, there were signs of chronic denervation of the muscle. Dissection of five cadavers revealed that the nerve supply to the anconeus epitrochlearis originated proximal to the medial epicondyle, traveled parallel to the ulnar nerve, terminated on the deep aspect of this muscle, and had a mean length of 60 mm. This clinicoanatomical study provides evidence that the innervation of the anconeus epitrochlearis is proximal to the muscle and on its deep aspect. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Detection of residual tumor during resection of glial brain tumors remains a challenge because of a low inherent contrast of adjacent edematous brain, the surrounding infiltration zone, and the solid tumor. Therefore, new technologies that may facilitate an intraoperative analysis of the tissue at the resection edge are of great interest to neurosurgeons. Materials and Methods For ex vivo imaging of gliomas in a mouse model and human biopsy specimens of brain tumors and nervous system tissue we have used a time-domain Sirius 713 Tomograph with a central wavelength of 1,310 nm and a coherence length of 15 µm equipped with a mono mode fiber and a modified optical coherence tomography (OCT) adapter containing a lens system for imaging at a working distance of 2.5 cm. A spectral-domain tomograph using 840 nm and 930 nm superluminescence diodes (SLD) with a central wavelength of 900 nm was used as a second imaging modelity. Results Both time-domain and spectral-domain coherence tomography delineated normal brain, the infiltration zone and solid tumor in murine intracerebral gliomas. Histological evaluation of H&E sections parallel to the optical plain demonstrated that tumor areas of less than a millimeter could be detected and that not only solid tumor, but also brain invaded by a low-density single tumor cells produced an OCT signal different from normal brain. Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) demonstrated a significantly more detailed microstructure of tumor and normal brain up to a tissue depth of 1.5?2.0 mm, whereas the interpretation of time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) was difficult at a tissue depth >1.0 mm. Because of rapid scanning times SD-OCT data could be acquired as 3D data maps, which allowed a multi-planar analysis of the tumor to brain interface. Similar to our findings in experimental gliomas, images of human nervous system tissue acquired using SD-OCT showed a characteristic signal of normal brain tissue and a detailed microstructure of tumor parenchyma. Conclusion Spectral-domain OCT of experimental gliomas and human brain tumor specimens differentiates solid tumor, diffusely invaded brain tissue, and adjacent normal brain based on microstructure and B-scan signal characteristics. In conjunction with the rapid image acquisition rates of SD-OCT, this technology carries the potential of a novel intraoperative imaging tool for the detection of residual tumor and guidance of neurosurgical tumor resections.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in the dog. Methods: A retrospective study to evaluate the use of a GIA stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in 15 dogs. Results: Reasons for intervention included dehiscence of a previous enterotomy (four of 15), intestinal neoplasia (five of 15), vascular compromise (three of 15), intussusception (two of 15) and foreign body (one of 15). The mean time taken to perform the anastomosis was 7·7 minutes (range five to 12 minutes). No operative complications were recorded and all dogs recovered from the surgery. Major (two dogs) and minor (six dogs) short-term complications of pyrexia and anorexia were recorded in six dogs. In five of these, the cause was considered to be related to a pre-existing peritonitis. One dog was euthanased five months postoperatively for a multi-centric recurrence of intestinal lymphoma. Six month follow-up confirmed an unremarkable and complete recovery in all remaining dogs. No major or minor long-term complications were recorded in any individual. Clinical Significance: A modified stapled functional end-to-end intestinal anastomosis holds merit and should be considered a viable alternative to other stapled and sutured anastomosis techniques.

AB  - The aim of this essay is to examine the ways in which Beijing perceives the issues of Tibet and Xinjiang differently in the context of its geostrategic thinking in international politics today. In doing so, this essay will provide a deeper understanding of Beijing's different geostrategic sensibilities of Tibet and Xinjiang in regard to rising China's national security interests in Central and South Asia. This essay argues that, although Beijing publicly sees the Tibet and Xinjiang problems as issues of securing Chinese sovereignty, geostrategically Beijing alludes to a subtle difference in its perception of the two regions: (i) the Tibet problem is a practical, domestic issue to be handled by Beijing's paternalistic engagement of modernization, and is a symbolic issue regarding how to manage rising China's benign image abroad while harshly oppressing any separatist voices in Tibet; and (ii) in Beijing's geostrategic thinking, Xinjiang's security importance seems to be defined in terms of energy security for China's economic growth, which is integral to social stability and the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy, as well as the transnational Islamic terrorist movement interlinked with Uyghur separatism in Xinjiang.

AB  - Objective To determine the prevalence, outcome and risk factors for postoperative pyothorax in dogs undergoing thoracic surgery. Methods Case records were reviewed retrospectively to identify dogs with post thoracic surgery pyothorax, defined as septic neutrophilic inflammation within the pleural space based on cytology and/or a positive bacterial culture of pleural fluid. Those identified were reviewed for potential risk factors for postoperative pyothorax based on biological plausibility and previously published data. These potential risk factors were explored by multivariable logistic regression. Results Of 232 dogs undergoing thoracic surgery, 15 (6·5%) dogs developed pyothorax. Bacteria cultured included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant Escherichia coli. Of these dogs, six died, four were euthanased and five were treated successfully. A diagnosis of idiopathic chylothorax [Odds Ratio (OR)=12·5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=2·7-58·5, P=0·001], preoperative intrathoracic biopsy (OR=14·3, 95% CI=1·7-118·7, P=0·014) and preoperative thoracocentesis (OR=11·2, 95% CI=1·6-78·2, P=0·015) were identified as independent risk factors for development of postoperative pyothorax. Clinical Significance Idiopathic chylothorax, intrathoracic biopsy and prior thoracocentesis are independent risk factors for postoperative pyothorax, which was associated with a 67% mortality rate.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Twenty Holocaust survivors gave extensive interviews about their experiences in the Holocaust and their lives since. This study affords a rare opportunity to explore language use and trauma using a within-subjects design. Consistent with past research which has shown that cognitive word use typically increases when describing stressful experiences, participants used a higher percentage of cognitive words when describing their Holocaust experiences, in comparison to describing non-Holocaust experiences. Four years after the interviews, participants completed memory questionnaires in relation to their Holocaust experiences and measures of physical health and cognitive functioning. The extent to which participants used an elevated use of insight words when describing their Holocaust experiences 4 years earlier was related to lower ratings of visceral emotional reactions, less avoidance and better lifetime physical health. The results are discussed in terms of how use of cognitive words when describing traumatic memories reflects adaptive psychological and coping processes. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the association between different subjective and objective assessments of ankle function in a population of athletes with or without functional ankle instability (FAI). 29 athletes with a history of ankle spraining were divided into two groups according to their ankle status: 16 with FAI (initial ankle sprain with residual functional instability) (age 24.6?±?3.1 years), and 13 COPERS (initial ankle sprain without residual instability) (age 25.3?±?4.4 years). The assessment of each individual's ankle function was based on three approaches: The ?functional-ankle-ability-measure? (FAAM) assessing subjective ankle functionality, measures of sensorimotor control as objective functional measurements and MRI-based T2-mapping as a quantitative marker of compositional joint status. Pearson's product-moment-correlation coefficient, student's t-test and analysis-of-variance were used for statistical analysis. Significant group differences existed for subjective ankle function (FAAM, p?=?0.04) and MRI-data mainly in the medial compartment of the ankle joint (p?≤?0.05). We found unique associations between T2-mapping results and sensorimotor scores in the COPER (r?=??0.756?0.849), and ?FAI?-group (r?=?0.630?0.657). The location and magnitude differed between groups. No correlations existed between these measures and the FAAM. This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential interrelations between various diagnostic measures of ankle function and structure in individuals with and without FAI. We found associations between MRI-results and selected measures of sensorimotor control, indicating a potential link between loss of ankle function and early joint degeneration. Despite these interrelations, each of the different assessment options appears to contain unique information on ankle functionality important in a clinical assessment. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Surgical resection of the mass, including a complete removal of the adjacent nuchal ligament, resulted in improvement in the signs of neck stiffness. Histopathological examination identified the mass as calcinosis circumscripta. These lesions do not appear to have been reported at this site nor has outcome following excision of a complete section of the nuchal ligament.

AB  - Objectives To describe the history, clinicopathological abnormalities, diagnostic imaging findings, lymph node cytological/histological appearance, treatment and outcome of English springer spaniels diagnosed with idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis. Materials and Methods In this retrospective UK-based multicentre study, 64 dogs were recruited from 10 referral centres, 32 first-opinion practices and three histopathology/cytology laboratories, between 2010 and 2016. Results The median age at presentation was 6 years (range: 0.17 to 11.75). Neutered females were frequently affected. Pyrexia (83.8%), peripheral lymphadenomegaly (78.4%), dermatological lesions (72.9%), lethargy (67.6%), hyporexia (54%), diarrhoea (29.7%), coughing (24.3%), epistaxis, sneezing or nasal discharge (21.6%), ocular signs (21.6%) and vomiting (16.2%) were reported in dogs for which the history and physical examination records were available. Popliteal (45.3%), superficial cervical (35.9%) and submandibular (37.5%) lymphadenomegaly were frequently reported. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed non-specific changes. When undertaken, testing for infectious diseases was negative in all cases. Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27%), pyogranulomatous (24%), neutrophilic (20%) or granulomatous (11%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38 dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15?weeks (range: 1 to 28?weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. Clinical Significance Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels. The characteristics of the disease, absence of identifiable infectious aetiology and response to glucocorticoid therapy suggest an immune-mediated aetiology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immobilization as a result of long-term bed rest can lead to gradual bone loss. Due to their distribution throughout the bone matrix and remarkable interconnectivity, osteocytes represent the major mechanosensors in bone and translate mechanical into biochemical signals controlling bone remodeling. To test whether immobilization affects the characteristics of the osteocyte network in human cortical bone, femoral diaphyseal bone specimens were analyzed in immobilized female individuals and compared to age-matched postmenopausal individuals with primary osteoporosis. Premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy individuals served as control groups. Cortical porosity, osteocyte number and lacunar area, the frequency of hypermineralized lacunae as well as cortical bone calcium content (CaMean) were assessed using bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Bone matrix properties were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the immobilization group, cortical porosity was significantly higher, and qBEI revealed a trend towards higher matrix mineralization compared to osteoporotic individuals. Osteocyte density and canalicular density showed a declining rate from premenopausal towards healthy postmenopausal and osteoporotic individuals with peculiar reductions in the immobilization group, while the number of hypermineralized lacunae accumulated inversely. In conclusion, reduced osteocyte density and impaired connectivity during immobilization are associated with a specific bone loss pattern, reflecting a phenotype clearly distinguishable from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Immobilization periods may lead to a loss of survival signals for osteocytes, provoking bone loss that is even higher than in osteoporosis states, while osteocytic osteolysis remains absent.

AB  - Abstract The in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) is now a powerful technique in biomedical research, especially for tracking specific cells in circulatory system. The current fluorescence-based IVFC is limited to visible spectrum, while near infrared (NIR) dyes have their advantages, such as deeper penetration, less absorption and less scattering for NIR fluorescence. Here, using an NIR in vivo flow cytometer with a 785 nm laser excitation, the measurement of fluorescent dye IR-780 labeled circulating cells is demonstrated. Representative peaks corresponding to NIR fluorescent circulating cells are detected and quantified. In addition, blood flow information, including the blood flow velocity and flow volume per unit time, is obtained. By simultaneous detection of IR-780 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) signals from dual labeled cells, the IR-780 is shown to be a suitable fluorescent dye for multicolor detection by IVFC, including NIR. Thus, the IVFC is extended to the NIR range and shows potential application in biomedical research. ? 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Abstract Introduction Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is an emerging imaging modality that provides subsurface microstructural and microvascular tissue images with near histological resolution and sub-mm/second velocity sensitivity. A key drawback of OCT for some applications is its shallow (1?3 mm) penetration depth. This fundamentally limits DOCT imaging to transparent, near-surface, intravascular, or intracavitary anatomical sites. Consequently, interstitial Doppler OCT (IS-DOCT) was developed for minimally-invasive in vivo imaging of microvasculature and microstructure at greater depths, providing access to deep-seated solid organs. Using Dunning prostate cancer in a rat xenograft model, this study evaluated the feasibility of IS-DOCT monitoring of microvascular changes deep within a tumor caused by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Materials and Methods The DOCT interstitial probe was constructed using a 22 G (diameter ?0.7 mm) needle, with an echogenic surface finish for enhanced ultrasound visualization. The lens of the probe consisted of a gradient-index fiber, fusion spliced to an angle-polished coreless tip to allow side-view scanning. The lens was then fusion spliced to a single-mode optical fiber that was attached to the linear scanner via catheters and driven along the longitudinal axis of the needle to produce a 2D subsurface DOCT image. The resultant IS-DOCT system was used to monitor microvascular changes deep within the tumor mass in response to PDT in the rat xenograft model of Dunning prostate cancer. Surface PDT was delivered at 635 nm with 40 mW of power, for a total light dose of 76 J/cm2, using 12.5 mg/kg of Photofrin as the photosensitizer dose. Results IS-DOCT demonstrated its ability to detect microvasculature in vivo and record PDT-induced changes. A reduction of detected vascular cross sectional area during treatment and partial recovery post-treatment were observed. Conclusions IS-DOCT is a potentially effective tool for real-time visualization and monitoring of the progress of PDT treatments. This capability may play an important role in elucidating the mechanisms of PDT in tumors, pre-treatment planning, feedback control for treatment optimization, determining treatment endpoints and post-treatment assessments.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cartilage T2 relaxation time in isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) without concomitant meniscal pathology and their changes over time remain unclear. The purpose of this exploratory study was to: (i) compare cartilage T2 relaxation time (T2 values) in people with isolated ACLR at 2?3 years post-surgery (baseline) and matched healthy controls and; (ii) evaluate the subsequent 2-year change in T2 values in people with ACLR. Twenty-eight participants with isolated ACLR and nine healthy volunteers underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline; 16 ACLR participants were re-imaged 2 years later. Cartilage T2 values in full thickness, superficial layers, and deep layers were quantified in the tibia, femur, trochlear, and patella. Between-group comparisons at baseline were performed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Changes over time in the ACLR group were evaluated using paired sample t-tests. ACLR participants showed significantly higher (p?=?0.03) T2 values in the deep layer of medial femoral condyle at baseline compared to controls (mean difference 4.4?ms [13%], 95%CI 0.4, 8.3?ms). Over 2 years, ACLR participants showed a significant reduction (p?=?0.04) in T2 value in the deep layer of lateral tibia (mean change 1.4?ms [?7%], 95%CI 0.04, 2.8?ms). The decrease in T2 values suggests improvement in cartilage composition in the lateral tibia (deep layer) of ACLR participants. Further research with larger ACLR cohorts divided according to meniscal status and matched healthy cohorts are needed to further understand cartilage changes post-ACLR. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective: To assess the usefulness of computed tomography arthrography of the stifle in diagnosing meniscal tears in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Dogs were included if they had evidence of cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency or persistent or recurrent lameness following surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Dogs were sedated for a computed tomography scan of the affected stifle, orientated in the dorsal plane. A survey computed tomography scan was followed by a computed tomography arthrogram. A stifle arthrotomy was performed, and the surgical findings were recorded. The computed tomography scans were reviewed by three blinded reviewers, and the results were compared to the surgical findings. Results: Twenty-one computed tomography arthrograms from 20 dogs were included. At surgery, damage to the medial meniscus was identified in 14 stifles. Initial interpretation of computed tomography arthrography images was 57 to 64 per cent sensitive and 71 to 100 per cent specific for diagnosing medial meniscal injuries. Interpretation of the images on retrospective analysis was 71 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, with an accuracy of 0·857. Clinical Significance: The accuracy of stifle computed tomography arthrography for the diagnosis of tears to the medial meniscus was found to be good. It is a minimally invasive and repeatable technique, which does not require general anaesthesia or specialist training to obtain the images. The ability to reliably diagnose meniscal injury without the need for surgery may be advantageous, particularly in dogs which had previously had surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of vitamin C and D intake with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of cartilage composition (T2) and joint structure (cartilage, meniscus, and bone marrow) using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) cohort. Methods 1785 subjects with radiographic Kellgren Lawrence knee grades 0-3 in the right knee were selected from the OAI database. Vitamin C and vitamin D intakes (diet, supplements, and total) were assessed from the baseline Block Brief 2000 questionnaire. The MRI analysis protocol included 3T cartilage T2 quantification and semi-quantitative joint morphology gradings (WORMS) at baseline and 4 years. Linear regression was used to assess the association between standardized baseline vitamin intake and both baseline WORMS scores and standardized cartilage T2. Results Higher vitamin C intake was associated with lower average cartilage T2, medial tibia T2 and medial tibia WORMS (coeff_standardized range: -0.07 to -0.05, p<0.05). Higher vitamin D intake was associated with lower cartilage WORMS sum score and medial femur WORMS score (coeff_standardized range: -0.24 to -0.09, p<0.05). Consistent use of vitamin D supplements over 4 years of 400 IU at least once a week was associated with significantly less worsening of cartilage, meniscus and bone marrow abnormalities (odds ratio range: 0.40 to 0.56, p<0.05). Conclusion Supplementation with vitamin D over four years was associated with significantly less progression of knee joint abnormalities. Given the observational nature of this study, future longitudinal randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation are warranted. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
