AB  - Gastric stump-pleural fistula is a common complication following gastroesophageal anastomosis in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. Mortality is high because of the severe subsequent relevant complications caused by the fistula. Here we report five cases of gastric stump-pleural fistula diagnosed by air perfusion radiography under digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA air perfusion radiography provides a reliable basis for the development of clinical programmes; it is a simple method which does not involve any pain or trauma to the patient.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the accuracy of various cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) devices in assessing the buccal bone in anterior teeth. Material and Methods A skull encased in tissue equivalent material was imaged with six CBCT devices: 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Japan), CS 9000 3D (Carestream Dental, France), CS 9300 (Carestream Dental, France), Eagle 3D (Dabi Atlante, Brazil), i-CAT Classic (Imaging Sciences International, USA) and Orthophos XG 3D (Sirona Dental System, USA). The exposure and acquisition protocols were determined using the manufacturer's guidelines, the voxel size adjusted as close as possible to 0.2 mm. Cross-sectional images were evaluated randomly, and the buccal bone was assessed. Results The statistics were calculated based on a logistic regression model with the significance level set at 5%. All CBCT devices showed high accuracy; however, observers noted that the accuracy and sensitivity of CS 9300 device were slightly superior. Conclusion The diagnostic performance of all CBCT devices was high for the evaluation of buccal bone in anterior teeth. When the clinical usefulness of an imaging modality is equivalent, the choice of appropriate imaging should be directed towards the modality that delivers the least radiation dose to the patient for a specific diagnostic task.

AB  - Abstract Breast cancer management has evolved from the conventional radical Halsted to a fully integrated multidisciplinary approach. Nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) is an innovative technique that preserves native breast envelope without mutilation of nipple-areola complex (NAC), thus providing a reasonable alternative for early cancers without NAC involvement and prophylactic high risk patients and avoids multiple surgical procedures required for reconstruction. This article aims to critically review indications, intra-operative protocols, radiotherapy planning and limitations of NSM. Patient selection should be based on study of breast duct anatomy by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mammographic tumor-nipple distance and obligatory intra-operative frozen section from retro-areolar tissue. Tumor size, axillary lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion and/or degree of intraductal component are factors used to include NSM candidates based on institutional practice. Given the heterogeneity of patients and lack of standardization of preoperative investigations, surgical technique and pathologic sampling of retro-areola tissue so far, mandates a multi-institutional prospective study to define and validate a role for NSM in invasive breast cancer and DCIS. Nipple necrosis is an important NSM complication which can be greatly reduced using alternative skin incisions. Even if the nipple survives, an insensate nipple and lack of sexual function is common and requires preoperative counseling and discussion. Finally the relation and timing of intra-operative versus adjuvant breast radiation and tailoring of dosage and delivery methods has not been fully explored. Although NSM reduces psychological trauma associated with nipple loss, the oncologic safety as well as functional and aesthetic outcomes needs additional investigation. Clin.

AB  - Summary A 24-hour-old male Shetland pony was presented for evaluation of unilateral hindlimb lameness of unknown duration. Physical and radiographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of medial luxation of the patella. A traumatic or congenital aetiology was suspected but could not be confirmed. Surgical correction of the luxation, using a modified recession trochleoplasty technique, was carried out. At 6 months follow-up, no discernbile lameness could be observed. In the literature, descriptions of medially luxated patellae in equids are rare. Published reports describing the use of peri- and intra-articular surgical techiques for the correction of luxated patellae in equids are widely available. The modified recession trochleoplasty employed in this case may offer advantages over previously published techniques.

AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides the reader with a working knowledge of the capabilities and specifications of the broad array of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanners that are currently available. It compares and contrasts several of the commonly used CBCT units and discusses their relative merits for use in orthodontics. The review of CBCT scanners is preceded by some of the essential information on CT imaging, including a discussion of concepts such as resolution, noise, artifacts, and determinants of radiation exposure. The major factors influencing contrast resolution include tube current, slice thickness, thickness of the region being imaged, detector sensitivity, reconstruction algorithm, and image display. The chapter lists the various CBCT scanners grouped on the basis of patient positioning in the scanner. Manufacturers currently are expanding protocols to enhance the utility and flexibility of CBCT units.

AB  - Abstract:? Breast cancer is a diverse disease that requires a fully integrated multidisciplinary approach. Breast surgery has undergone a revolutionary change leading us from the conventional radical mastectomy of the Halstedian era to the current motion of nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials, the technique of NSM continues to gain popularity as a prophylactic procedure in high risk patients. The current indications for NSM, if any, in the treatment of early invasive breast cancer remains uncertain and requires rigorous scientific scrutiny. This article aims to critically review the indications and limitations of NSM, discuss evidence based intra-operative protocols and to discuss ways in which radiation therapy may be incorporated in treatment planning following NSM. A comprehensive search of the scientific literature was carried out using PubMed to access all publications related to nipple sparing mastectomy. The search focused specifically on technique, current management, safety, and complications of these procedures. Keywords searched included ?Nipple sparing mastectomy,??breast conserving surgery,??Nipple areola complex preservation? and ?skin sparing mastectomy.? NSM offers an opportunity to preserve native breast envelope without mutilation of nipple-areola complex (NAC), and avoids multiple surgical procedures required for reconstruction. NSM may be a reasonable alternative for prophylactic and select breast cancer patients without NAC involvement; however, oncological safety of NSM has not yet been fully demonstrated. Best available evidence suggests that patients should be selected based on study of breast duct anatomy by breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mammographic distance between tumor and nipple and obligatory intra-operative frozen section from retro-areolar tissue. Additional factors such as tumor size, axillary lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion and degree of intraductal component are also being used to either include or exclude NSM candidates based on institutional protocols. Heterogeneity of patients selected for NSM is great and the lack of standardization of preoperative investigations, intra-operative technique and pathologic sampling of retro-areola tissues mandates a multi-institutional prospective study to define and validate a role for NSM in invasive breast cancer and DCIS. Nipple necrosis or sloughing is an important problem after NSM which can be greatly reduced using alternative skin incisions. Even if the nipple survives, an insensate nipple and lack of sexual function is common and requires preoperative counseling and discussion. Finally the relation and timing of intra-operative versus adjuvant breast radiation and tailoring of dosage and delivery methods has not been fully explored. Although NSM reduces the psychological trauma associated with nipple loss, the oncologic safety as well as functional and aesthetic outcomes needs additional investigation.

AB  - Objective: To describe in detail the computed tomographic findings in elbows of dogs with fragmentation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna. Methods: Retrospective review of computed tomographic images of 58 elbows that had displaced medial coronoid process fragment(s), non-displaced medial coronoid process fragment or a stable fissure in the articular cartilage of the medial coronoid process at arthroscopy. Results: Bone fragments were observed in 85 per cent elbows with a displaced fragment at arthroscopy, in 18 per cent elbows with a non-displaced fragment and in 29 per cent elbows with a stable fissure. Fissures in the subchondral bone were observed in computed tomographic images of 43 per cent elbows that had a stable fissure at arthroscopy. Abnormal shape, sclerosis and lucency affecting the medial coronoid process, subchondral sclerosis of the ulna and humerus, irregular radial incisure of the ulna and periarticular osteophytes were observed in a similar proportion in dogs regardless of the arthroscopic findings. Kissing lesions affecting the medial aspect of the humeral condyle were mainly associated with displaced fragments. Signs of joint incongruity were observed in dorsal and sagittal reconstructed computed tomographic images in 24 per cent elbows. Clinical Significance: A wide range of abnormalities may be observed in computed tomographic images of dogs with fragmented medial coronoid process. Computed tomographic is moderately sensitive for detection of fragments.

AB  - Objective To describe the MRI characteristics of normal palatine tonsils in dogs. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of 95 dogs with presumed normal tonsils. Tonsillar margination, shape and signal intensity in pre- and postcontrast studies were assessed and the cross-sectional area was measured at the point of maximal size on transverse images. Results In all cases the tonsils were located with their largest transverse cross-section at the level of the temporomandibular joints. Their margins were well-defined in all dogs; in 57 (60%) the borders were smooth and in 38 (40%) slightly irregular. The majority (96%) of the tonsils were rounded to oval in cross-section and the remainder were elongated. All tonsils were hyperintense to the medial pterygoid muscles in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR and T2* gradient echo images and they showed either homogeneous (53%) or heterogeneous (47%) signal intensity. Contrast enhancement was marked (65%) or moderate (33%) in the majority of animals. Median tonsillar cross-sectional area was approximately 29 mm2 (90% confidence interval: 10.0 to 64.4 mm2). There was significant positive correlation between bodyweight and tonsillar cross-sectional area and a weak negative correlation between age and tonsillar cross-sectional area. Clinical Significance MRI is of value in assessing normal palatine tonsils in dogs. This study could be used as a baseline for the investigation of the value of MRI in assessment of tonsillar disease in dogs.

Recognition and assessment of ocular lesions in horses with systemic disease is desirable to facilitate diagnosis and determination of treatment options and diagnosis for both the underlying systemic disease and ocular manifestations. The purpose of this article is to review systemic diseases of horses that may have ocular signs as part of the disease process. Systemic diseases are discussed in categories of pathways for development of ocular signs, namely immunological disease, neurological disease or local/systemic spread of disease.

Methods: A multi-centre, blinded, randomised study was conducted in 129 dogs with urinary tract infections. Cephalexin (RilexineTM) administered twice daily at 15 mg/kg bodyweight orally for 14 days was compared with a single, subcutaneous injection of cefovecin (ConveniaTM) in dogs. The primary efficacy parameter assessed was bacterial elimination of the pretreatment uropathogen. Results: One hundred and twenty-nine dogs were included in efficacy assessments. Escherichia coli was eliminated in 90·5 per cent of cefovecin-treated dogs compared with 52·9 per cent of cephalexin-treated dogs (P=0·0004). Overall cure rates for dogs with Escherichia coli infections were 79·1 per cent for cefovecin and 36·4 per cent for cephalexin-treated dogs (P=0·0003). There were no suspected adverse drug reactions attributed to treatment with cefovecin or cephalexin. Clinical Significance: Cefovecin was shown to be an effective and safe treatment for urinary tract infections.

AB  - 'Community mobilization' in the Community Trials Project refers to organizing community members to support and implement policies to reduce alcohol-involved trauma. This paper defines the conceptual model of mobilization used in the project. In evaluating the project, we were guided by the conceptual model and we used structured materials from interviews with local staff in all three experimental communities; we found that the overall goal of mobilization (implementation of policies) was achieved. Additional observations based on naturalistic case studies of the communities include: (1) the importance of an established research base, (2) the varying role and problematic nature of coalitions, (3) the strategic advantage of early project support among the general population, (4) the role played by key leaders in mobilization, (5) the advantages of a multi-component design, and (6) the key role played by media advocacy.

AB  - ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE The use of head computed tomography (CT) is standard in the management of acute brain injury; however, there are inherent risks of transport of critically ill patients. Portable CT can be brought to the patient at any location. METHODS We describe the clinical use of a portable head CT scanner (CereTom: NeuroLogica: Danvers, MA) that can be brought to the patient's bedside or to other locations such as the operating room or angiography suite. RESULTS Between June of 2006 and December of 2009, a total of 3421 portable CTs were performed. A total of 3278 (95.8%) were performed in the neuroscience intensive care unit (ICU) for an average of 2.6 neuroscience ICU CT scans per day. Other locations where CTs were performed included other ICUs (n= 97), the operating room (n= 53), the emergency department (n= 1), and the angiography suite (n= 2). Most studies were non-contrasted head CT, though other modalities including xenon/CT, contrasted CT, and CT angiography were performed. CONCLUSION Portable head CT can reliably and consistently be performed at the patient's bedside. This should lead to decreased transportation-related morbidity and improved rapid decision making in the ICU, OR, and other locations. Further studies to confirm this clinical advantage are needed.

AB  - Background The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the study of child- and adult-onset developmental psychopathologies has generated many investigations that have measured brain structure and function in vivo throughout development, often generating great excitement over our ability to visualize the living, developing brain using the attractive, even seductive images that these studies produce. Often lost in this excitement is the recognition that brain imaging generally, and MRI in particular, is simply a technology, one that does not fundamentally differ from any other technology, be it a blood test, a genotyping assay, a biochemical assay, or behavioral test. No technology alone can generate valid scientific findings. Rather, it is only technology coupled with a strong experimental design that can generate valid and reproducible findings that lead to new insights into the mechanisms of disease and therapeutic response. Methods In this review we discuss selected studies to illustrate the most common and important limitations of MRI study designs as most commonly implemented thus far, as well as the misunderstanding that the interpretations of findings from those studies can create for our theories of developmental psychopathologies. Results Common limitations of MRI study designs are in large part responsible thus far for the generally poor reproducibility of findings across studies, poor generalizability to the larger population, failure to identify developmental trajectories, inability to distinguish causes from effects of illness, and poor ability to infer causal mechanisms in most MRI studies of developmental psychopathologies. For each of these limitations in study design and the difficulties they entail for the interpretation of findings, we discuss various approaches that numerous laboratories are now taking to address those difficulties, which have in common the yoking of brain imaging technologies to studies with inherently stronger designs that permit more valid and more powerful causal inferences. Those study designs include epidemiological, longitudinal, high-risk, clinical trials, and multimodal imaging studies. Conclusions We highlight several studies that have yoked brain imaging technologies to these stronger designs to illustrate how doing so can aid our understanding of disease mechanisms and in the foreseeable future can improve clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment planning for developmental psychopathologies.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Embryo transfer (ET) is an increasingly common component of commercial sport-horse breeding. While many variables affect the success of ET, optimal selection of recipient mares is essential. Ideally, adequate corpus luteum (CL) function would be evaluated by measuring plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations (≥2.0?ng/ml). In practice however, P4 is rarely measured because it would increase costs, and there is a delay to obtaining a result. Colour-flow Doppler sonography (CF) has been described as a rapid means of assessing CL function because luteal blood flow correlates with circulating P4 concentrations. Objectives To use CF to assess luteal blood flow at the time of ET in recipient mares, and assess its relationship to P4 concentrations and pregnancy outcome. Study design Cohort study. Methods Fifty-eight Day 8 horse embryos were transferred as part of a commercial programme. B-mode and CF sonographic examinations were performed immediately prior to ET (ET+0), and blood was collected to measure plasma P4. Measurements were repeated at 4, 11, 18 and 25 days after ET in pregnant mares. Mares scanned not pregnant at Day 4 were re-checked 2 days later. The CF image of each CL was frozen at peak total area of flow, and repeated 3 times. The cross-sectional area (corrected for presence of lacunae) and the total area of colour pixels within the CL were analysed using ImageJ software. Results Plasma P4 correlated positively (P<0.05) with area of colour pixels (range r?=?0.40?0.55) and total CL area (range r?=?0.41?0.51) at all time-points. None of plasma P4, CL area, or CF pixel area were predictive of pregnancy outcome. Conclusions CL blood flow is not predictive of pregnancy outcome but should help identify mares with an inadequate CL and not therefore suitable for receiving an embryo.

AB  - Abstract??? The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize epidemiologic trends in anterior permanent tooth trauma in a sample of children and adolescents (ii) examine the relationship of crown fractures (CF) and concomitant root fractures (RF) to determine if CFs are protective against RFs and (iii) examine the radiographic evidence of RFs to determine the value of obtaining three vertical periapical radiographic projections. This was an 8-year cross-sectional study of patients aged 6?18 with anterior permanent tooth trauma. We examined cases involving maxillary central/lateral incisors for which three clearly diagnostic periapical radiographs were obtained during the initial emergency visit. Two trained and calibrated dentists served as expert examiners for the radiographic assessments. Kappa statistics were used to determine reliability. Tests for association of concomitant crown and root fractures were performed using Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square tests. The final sample included 185 teeth in 114 children. Our demographic and epidemiologic findings were comparable to those of previous studies. Experts reached this consensus: 22 RFs were detected, 9.6% (eight out of 83) teeth exhibited root fractures when no CFs was documented, and 13.7% (14 out of 102) teeth had both CFs and RFs as separate entities. Good examiner reliability was reached confirming the presence of RFs (Kappa?=?0.81). The association of concomitant RFs and CFs was odds ratio?=?1.97 (P?=?0.052). CFs were not protective against RFs; indeed, teeth with CFs were twice as likely to have an RF as those without CFs. As the number of radiographic projections increased, RFs were identified more often; however, our data suggest that there is no reason to suspect a complete RF in preteen children unless the root exhibits clinical signs such as luxation or severe mobility. This study provides solid evidence to support obtaining multiple radiographic projections at different vertical angulations to rule out RFs in children and adolescents when RFs are suspected.
