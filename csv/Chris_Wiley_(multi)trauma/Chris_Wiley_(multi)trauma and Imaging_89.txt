AB  - Abstract Diagnosing pulmonary embolus (PE) remains one of the great challenges of emergency medicine. The diagnosis relies on a balance of probabilities rather than any definitive test. The probability is based on history, examination and investigations. The principal investigations are chest X-ray, arterial blood gas, electrocardiograph, ventilation perfusion scan, ultrasound and angiography where necessary. Newer techniques such as CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging will become more useful as the technology improves. Transoesophoegeal echocardiography is an important investigative tool for massive PE. Thrombolysis is increasingly being used in the management of PE and the higher risk of adverse outcome should be balanced against the probability of false positive results and the use of invasive angiography.

AB  - Abstract??? The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize epidemiologic trends in anterior permanent tooth trauma in a sample of children and adolescents (ii) examine the relationship of crown fractures (CF) and concomitant root fractures (RF) to determine if CFs are protective against RFs and (iii) examine the radiographic evidence of RFs to determine the value of obtaining three vertical periapical radiographic projections. This was an 8-year cross-sectional study of patients aged 6?18 with anterior permanent tooth trauma. We examined cases involving maxillary central/lateral incisors for which three clearly diagnostic periapical radiographs were obtained during the initial emergency visit. Two trained and calibrated dentists served as expert examiners for the radiographic assessments. Kappa statistics were used to determine reliability. Tests for association of concomitant crown and root fractures were performed using Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square tests. The final sample included 185 teeth in 114 children. Our demographic and epidemiologic findings were comparable to those of previous studies. Experts reached this consensus: 22 RFs were detected, 9.6% (eight out of 83) teeth exhibited root fractures when no CFs was documented, and 13.7% (14 out of 102) teeth had both CFs and RFs as separate entities. Good examiner reliability was reached confirming the presence of RFs (Kappa?=?0.81). The association of concomitant RFs and CFs was odds ratio?=?1.97 (P?=?0.052). CFs were not protective against RFs; indeed, teeth with CFs were twice as likely to have an RF as those without CFs. As the number of radiographic projections increased, RFs were identified more often; however, our data suggest that there is no reason to suspect a complete RF in preteen children unless the root exhibits clinical signs such as luxation or severe mobility. This study provides solid evidence to support obtaining multiple radiographic projections at different vertical angulations to rule out RFs in children and adolescents when RFs are suspected.

AB  - Abstract Aim A spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare paediatric bacterial infection, with possible devastating neurological sequelae. We explored localisation in the cervical segment, which is unusual, but more dangerous, than other SEAs. Methods We describe 22 cases (12 male) of paediatric SEAs without risk factors: 21 from a literature search from 2000 to 2017 and a 30-month-old boy with a spontaneous cervical SEA due to Group A Streptococcus. Results The average age was eight years and the symptoms were mainly fever, back pain and motor deficit, with an aetiological diagnosis in 68%. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in six patients, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in two, Staphylococcus aureus with unknown susceptibility patterns in three and Group A Streptococcus in four. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and most abscesses were localised in the thoracic and lumbar areas. More than half (59%) underwent surgery to remove pus and granulation tissue and nine were just treated with antimicrobial therapy for an average of 5.3Â weeks. Most patients had good outcomes. Conclusion SEAs were underestimated in children due to the rarity and spectrum of differential diagnoses. Timely diagnosis, immediate antibiotics, spinal magnetic resonance imaging and prompt neurosurgical consultations were essential for favourable outcomes.

AB  - Summary The normal vertebral artery (VA) can be divided into four segments: the V1 or extraosseous segment; the V2 or foraminal segment; the V3 or extraspinal segment; and the V4 or intradural segment. There are various carotid-vertebral and carotid basilar anastomoses which develop from the persistence of primitive arteries arising from dorsal extensions of the early internal carotid artery (ICA). Embolism is the most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia, and vertebral artery stenosis is the second most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia. Dissection of the vertebral artery occurs most frequently at the level of the second and third cervical vertebrae. Dissection events occur more frequently in patients who may have fibromuscular disease, a family history, and patients with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vertebral artery dissection is most frequently related to either spontaneous dissection or external trauma. Most vertebral intervention is now being done with an entirely endovascular approach.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Objectives? While morphological abnormalities of the pubovisceral muscle have been described on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), their relevance remains unclear. This study was designed to define prevalence and clinical significance of such abnormalities in urogynaecological patients. Design? Prospective observational study. Setting? Tertiary urogynaecological clinic. Population? Three hundred and thirty-eight consecutive women referred for urodynamic assessment. Methods? Participants underwent a clinical assessment, multichannel urodynamics and imaging with 3D translabial ultrasound. Blinded offline analysis was performed with the software 4D View (GE Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria). Main outcome measures? Major morphological abnormalities of the pubovisceral muscle. Results? Defects of the pubovisceral muscle were found in 15.4% of parous women. They were exclusively anteromedial (uni- or bilateral), only occurred among women who had delivered vaginally and were associated with anterior and central compartment prolapse (all P < 0.001). There was no association with symptoms of bladder dysfunction or urodynamic findings. Conclusions? Major morphological abnormalities of the pubovisceral muscle are common in parous urogynaecological patients. They are associated with prolapse of the anterior and central compartment, but not with symptoms of bladder dysfunction or urodynamic findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To develop a scoring system model that predicts mortality within 30?days of admission of patients older than 80?years admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A total of 306 ICUs from 24 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Older adults admitted to European ICUs (N?=?3730; median age?=?84?years [interquartile range?=?81-87 y]; 51.8% male). MEASUREMENTS Overall, 24 variables available during ICU admission were included as potential predictive variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Model sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS The 30-day-mortality was 1562 (41.9%). In multivariable analysis, these variables were selected as independent predictors of mortality: age, sex, ICU admission diagnosis, Clinical Frailty Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The discrimination, accuracy, and calibration of the model were good: the area under the curve for a score of 10 or higher was .80, and the Brier score was .18. At a cut point of 10 or higher (75% of all patients), the model predicts 30-day mortality in 91.1% of all patients who die. CONCLUSION A predictive model of cumulative events predicts 30-day mortality in patients older than 80?years admitted to ICUs. Future studies should include other potential predictor variables including functional status, presence of advance care plans, and assessment of each patient's decision-making capacity.

These include the identification and elimination of precipitating factors, in association with, or followed by, specific measures designed to reduce arterial ammonia levels. In many patients, liver transplantation may offer the only chance of effective management of this challenging clinical problem.

AB  - Objectives: Co-oximetry is a complex and valuable laboratory method that measures haemoglobin species and oxygenation status by multi-wavelength spectrophotometry. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for clinically healthy dogs and to determine the effect of time of analyses and sex of animals on the accuracy of results. Methods: Blood was collected from 27 healthy adult dogs of various breeds and sex. Co-oximetry was performed on a CCX co-oximeter that measures eight haemoglobin and oxygen transport related parameters: carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb), oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb), methaemoglobin (MetHb), total haemoglobin (tHb), oxygen saturation (SO2%), oxygen content (O2Ct) and oxygen capacity (O2Cap). Results: Results obtained after 2 and 4 hours were not significantly different from those obtained immediately after sampling. But after 48 hours, the results for total haemoglobin, oxygen saturation, oxyhaemoglobin, oxygen content and oxygen capacity were significantly lower, and carboxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin values were significantly higher than determination immediately after sampling. Gender had no significant impact on co-oximetry values. Clinical Significance: Co-oximetry offers several advantages compared with other methods, including ease of use, increased accuracy and greater differentiation among haemoglobin species.

AB  - ABSTRACT Canine distemper virus causes a multi systemic disease in dogs often with severe neurological signs. These signs are the result of viral replication in neurons and glial cells leading to grey matter lesions and demyelination. Inflammation leads to further destruction of the tissue. As extraneural signs are often lacking and only one localisation may be found on neurological examination, distemper may be difficult to diagnose. Myoclonus is almost pathognomonic for this disease but occurs in less than half of the cases. The inflammation of the central nervous system that occurs during the chronic stage of the disease can be detected on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, in particular by determination of the IgG index. Viral antigen can be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid cells by fluorescent antibody techniques. The prognosis of nervous distemper is generally poor although dogs can recover from this disease. Treatment is largely supportive and symptomatic. The importance of regular vaccination is stressed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Structural evidence of exercise-induced muscle disruption has traditionally involved histological analysis of muscle tissue obtained by needle biopsy, however, there are multiple limitations with this technique. Recently, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) has been successfully demonstrated to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle abnormalities induced by traumatic injury. Methods: To determine the potential for DT-MRI to detect musculoskeletal changes after a bout of eccentric exercise, 10 healthy men performed 300 eccentric actions on an isokinetic dynamometer. DT-MRI measurements and muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were obtained before and 24 h post-exercise. Results: Z-band streaming was higher 24 h post-exercise compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The histological indices of damage coincided with changes in DT-MRI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient; reflecting altered skeletal muscle geometry (P < 0.05). Z-band streaming quantified per fiber correlated with FA (r = ?0.512; P < 0.05). Conclusions: DT-MRI can detect changes in human skeletal muscle structure following eccentric exercise.

AB  - Objective To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=20). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. Results Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.

AB  - Abstract Achieving adequate healing in large or load-bearing bone defects is highly challenging even with surgical intervention. The clinical standard of repairing bone defects using autografts or allografts has many drawbacks. A bioactive ceramic scaffold, strontium-hardystonite-gahnite or ?Sr-HT-Gahnite? (a multi-component, calcium silicate-based ceramic) is developed, which when 3D-printed combines high strength with outstanding bone regeneration ability. In this study, the performance of purely synthetic, 3D-printed Sr-HT-Gahnite scaffolds is assessed in repairing large and load-bearing bone defects. The scaffolds are implanted into critical-sized segmental defects in sheep tibia for 3 and 12 months, with bone autografts used for comparison. The scaffolds induce substantial bone formation and defect bridging after 12 months, as indicated by X-ray, micro-computed tomography, and histological and biomechanical analyses. Detailed analysis of the bone-scaffold interface using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy and multiphoton microscopy shows scaffold degradation and maturation of the newly formed bone. In silico modeling of strain energy distribution in the scaffolds reveal the importance of surgical fixation and mechanical loading on long-term bone regeneration. The clinical application of 3D-printed Sr-HT-Gahnite scaffolds as a synthetic bone substitute can potentially improve the repair of challenging bone defects and overcome the limitations of bone graft transplantation.

AB  - Objective To characterize bone height and buccal cortical bone thickness of the caudal mandible of healthy dogs. Study Design Prospective original study. Sample Population Client-owned dogs (n?=?36). Methods Dogs were distributed by weight into 3 groups (<10, 10?20, >20?kg). Thirteen transverse plane computed tomography images were selected for each dog based on anatomic landmarks from the 4th premolar (PM4) through the 2nd molar. On each image, bone thickness was measured along the buccal surface of both mandibles from the alveolar margin to the ventral border in 3?mm increments. The number of 3?mm increments were recorded as an estimation of mandibular height. Results Buccal bone was generally thicker ventrally in the area studied with decreasing bone thickness over both roots of PM4 and the mesial root of the 1st molar (M1). Cortical bone thickness of <2.0?mm was measured across all groups at most locations 3?mm ventral from the alveolar margin. Mandibular bone height demonstrated significantly fewer (P?<?.05) 3?mm increments over the distal root of M1 in dogs >10?kg compared with the number of observations at the immediately mesial and distal locations. Conclusion Thin cortical bone overlying the mesial and distal roots of PM4 and the mesial root of M1 limits use of these areas for application of monocortical anchorage devices. Decreased mandibular bone height at mandibular M1 may create a stress riser at this location, which along with thin cortical bone may explain why this is a common area for mandibular fracture.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of computed tomography scanning in the management of dogs with chronic signs after oropharyngeal stick injury. Methods: Dogs with a final diagnosis of chronic oropharyngeal stick injury that underwent a computed tomography scan during their investigation were selected retrospectively from case files at the Royal Veterinary College, London. Results: The six dogs were young (median age 3Â·1 years) and medium to large breed (19Â·0 to 42Â·0 kg). By the time of referral the most common clinical sign was cervical swelling (five dogs). Stick foreign bodies were apparent on the plain computed tomography images in all cases and appeared as well-demarcated, linear abnormalities. A ventral mid-line approach was used for foreign body retrieval, and the computed tomography findings corresponded well with the surgical findings, with stick foreign body length ranging from 1 to 7 cm. Closed suction drainage was used in five dogs, for two to four days. Clinical signs fully resolved postoperatively in all cases, although cervical swelling recurred three weeks after surgery in one case. This dog had the smallest foreign body, the greatest number of surgical interventions before referral (three) and the longest disease course before referral (eight months). Clinical Significance: Computed tomography scanning is accurate in identifying the presence and location of chronic stick foreign bodies. Recurrence of disease is possible despite successful retrieval of the wood fragments found by computed tomography scan.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections are now known to be a common and important problem in the Unites States. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of MRSA infection in skin abrasion wounds using a mouse model. Study Design/Materials and Methods A mouse model of skin abrasion wound infected with MRSA was developed. Bioluminescent strain of MRSA, a derivative of ATCC 33591, was used to allow the real-time monitoring of the extent of infection in mouse wounds. PDT was performed with the combination of a polyethylenimine (PEI)?ce6 photosensitizer (PS) and non-coherent red light. In vivo fluorescence imaging was carried out to evaluate the effect of photobleaching of PS during PDT. Results In vivo fluorescence imaging of conjugate PEI?ce6 applied in mice indicated the photobleaching effect of the PS during PDT. PDT induced on average 2.7?log10 of inactivation of MRSA as judged by loss of bioluminescence in mouse skin abrasion wounds and accelerated the wound healing on average by 8.6 days in comparison to the untreated infected wounds. Photobleaching of PS in the wound was overcome by adding the PS solution in aliquots. Conclusion PDT may represent an alternative approach for the treatment of MRSA skin infections. Lasers Surg.

AB  - Summary Photography should be regarded as an integral part of daily clinical practice, and photographic equipment as part of the dental armamentarium, no different to a dental handpiece. However, the common consensus is that a camera is an extraneous apparatus, exclusively reserved for specialists, or clinicians with a penchant for taking pictures. The technical requirements of a lens for dental photography is that it serves a dual-purpose, first for portraiture and second for close-up or macrophotography. Many cameras have built-in flashes that pop-up when the lighting conditions are less than optimal. This is satisfactory for general photography but ill-advised for macrophotography. Some relatively inexpensive items are also useful for completing the photographic equipment arsenal. These include rechargeable batteries, a multi-card reader for transferring images to a computer, UV bulbs for visualising fluorescence of natural teeth and artificial prostheses, or porosity defects in porcelain restorations.
