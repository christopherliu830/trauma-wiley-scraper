AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - Objective To describe the frequency and extent of complications associated with lateral caudal axial pattern flaps used to cover large traumatic or excision skin defects on the dorsum, gluteal, and perineal region in 13 dogs. Study Design Case series. Animals Thirteen client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 8 institutions were reviewed for dogs treated with a lateral caudal axial pattern flap, including cases in which the procedure was combined with other reconstructive techniques. The flap length relative to the tail length, location of tail skin incision, size and cause of the defect, and short- and long-term complications were recorded. Results Thirteen dogs were included, 11 with tumors and 2 with traumatic skin loss. The mean estimated length of the flap relative to tail length was 51% (range 33?70%). Four dogs had wound complications. This included 2 dogs with minor postoperative wound complications (mild distal dehiscence) that did not require surgical revision and 2 dogs with major complications that required surgical revision. Two of these 4 dogs had distal flap necrosis, one was revised surgically and one was managed conservatively. In these 2 dogs, the flap length was estimated as 80% and 65% of the tail length, respectively. At 30 days, flaps in all dogs were completely healed. No long-term complications were recorded in any dog. For some dogs, the reconstruction was not obvious, with only the change in hair direction and color noticeable. Conclusion Lateral caudal axial pattern flap is a reconstructive option for gluteal, dorsal, and perineal skin defects in dogs. Distal flap necrosis and dehiscence due to wound infection occurred in 4 dogs that required additional wound care but not always surgical revision.

AB  - Summary Whole blood re-calcification times were evaluated as a measure of endotoxin-associated coagulopathy in horses. First, the effects of endotoxin concentration and duration of in vitro incubation of citrated whole blood with endotoxin on the whole blood re-calcification time of blood collected from healthy horses were determined. Increasing concentrations or incubation times of endotoxin accelerated the whole blood re-calcification time. This effect was attributed mainly to increased monocyte thromboplastin activity. Second, whole blood re-calcification time, a clotting profile, plasma factor VII activity and plasma endotoxin concentration on blood samples obtained from 35 equine colic patients and 10 healthy horses were determined. Compared with healthy horses, colic patients had a longer mean whole blood re-calcification and prothrombin time, lower per cent factor VII activity and higher mean fibrin degradation products concentration. Within the colic patient group, horses that did not survive had detectable endotoxin in plasma, longer whole blood re-calcification and prothrombin times, and lower plasma factor VII activity, compared with colic patients that survived. These data indicate that colic patients with endotoxaemia experience hypercoagulable states, followed by consumptive coagulopathy. Although the cause of endotoxin-associated coagulopathy is likely multi-factorial, increased expression of monocyte thromboplastin activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy. The whole blood re-calcification time is a simple, fast and inexpensive way to detect coagulopathy during endotoxaemia and determine the prognosis for survival.

AB  - Background Despite calls for integration of neurobiological methods into research on youth resilience (high competence despite high adversity), we know little about structural brain correlates of resilient functioning. The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. Methods 1,870 European adolescents (Mage = 14.56 years, SDage = 0.44 years, 51.5% female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. Results The interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. Conclusions We demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.

AB  - Abstract The human interosseous membrane (IOM) is a fundamental stabilizer during forearm rotation. To investigate the dynamic aspects of forearm stability, we analyzed sensory nerve endings in the IOM. The distal oblique bundle (DOB), the distal accessory band (DAB), the central band (CB), the proximal accessory band (PAB), the dorsal oblique accessory cord (DOAC) and the proximal oblique cord (POC) were dissected from 11 human cadaver forearms. Sensory nerve endings were analyzed at two levels per specimen as total cell amount/mm2 after immunofluorescence staining with low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5, S-100 protein and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole on an Apotome microscope, according to Freeman and Wyke?s classification. Sensory nerve endings were significantly more commonly found to be equally distributed throughout the structures, rather than being epifascicular, interstitial, or close to the insertion into bone (P ≤ 0.001, respectively). Free nerve endings were the predominant mechanoreceptor in all six structures, with highest density in the DOB, followed by the POC (P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). The DOB had the highest density of Pacini corpuscles. The DOAC and CB had the lowest amounts of sensory innervation. The high density of sensory corpuscles in the DOB, PAB and POC indicate that proprioceptive control of the compressive and directional muscular forces acting on the distal and proximal radioulnar joints is monitored by the DOB, PAB and POC, respectively, due to their closed proximity to both joints, whereas the central parts of the IOM act as structures of passive restraint.

AB  - One of the challenges of minimally invasive surgery is the dexterous manipulation and precise control of small-diameter continuum surgical instruments. Herein, a magnetic continuum device with variable stiffness (VS) is presented, whose tip is precisely shaped and controlled using an external magnetic field. Based on a low melting point alloy (LMPA), the serial segments composing the continuum device are independently softened via electrical current and remotely deformed under a magnetic torque, whereas the rest of the device is locked in place. The resulting system has the advantage of combining the precision of magnetic navigation with additional degrees of freedom provided by changing the segments stiffness. With a minimum diameter as small as 2.33?mm and an inner working channel, the magnetic continuum device with VS is adapted to use in several therapeutic scenarios, including radio-frequency cardiac ablations and interventional endoscopy in the gastrointestinal tract. The magnetic torque is used to remotely control the shape of the soft sections, whereas the stiff sections remain unchanged, thus adding degrees of freedom to the magnetic continuum device.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Lyophilised products from green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus[LPPC]) are used to orally treat horses with osteoarthritis (OA). However, no randomised, controlled or double-blinded studies on the efficacy of this treatment in horses have been reported to date. Objective: To investigate the effects of a unique LPPC (Biolane)1 in improving clinical signs of OA in the fetlock. Methods: Data were analysed from 26 horses with primary fetlock lameness in a controlled, randomised and double-blinded, multi-centre clinical trial. The study design was a partial crossover with a washout period and consisted of 19 horses treated with LPPC and 20 with a placebo. Horses were dosed orally with 25?mg/kg bwt/day LPPC or placebo for 56 days. Efficacy was evaluated by clinical assessment of lameness, passive flexion, pain, swelling and heat in the affected joint. Relationships between variables were analysed using an ordinal logistic model with random effects for horse and horse x treatment according to a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Clinical evaluation of horses with a fetlock lameness treated with LPPC showed a significant reduction in severity of lameness (P<0.001), improved response to the joint flexion test (P<0.001) and reduced joint pain (P = 0.014) when compared with horses treated with placebo. Conclusions: The LPPC significantly alleviated the severity of lameness and joint pain and improved response to joint flexion in horses with lameness attributable to OA in the fetlock.

AB  - Chile entered a period of political turmoil when Dr Salvador Allende, a socialist, won the 1970 presidential election. After he was overthrown, Chile was governed by a military dictatorship that engaged in massive human rights violations. Some 30 years later, this article summarizes the psychological consequences of the traumas that victims experienced and the emotions triggered in these individuals and their families, as well as the very real difficulties they faced. This report focuses on the loss and grief that many families experienced after a family member was imprisoned and tortured or assassinated, or both. Systemic therapeutic implications of the difficulties these families faced are proposed.

AB  - Abstract During brain development, a population of uniform embryonic cells migrates and differentiates into a large number of neural phenotypes ? origin of the enormous complexity of the adult nervous system. Processes of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed death of no longer required cells, do not occur only during embryogenesis, but are also maintained during adulthood and are affected in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease states. As neurogenesis is an endogenous response to brain injury, visible as proliferation (of to this moment silent stem or progenitor cells), its further stimulation can present a treatment strategy in addition to stem cell transfer for cell regeneration therapy. Concise techniques for studying such events in vitro and in vivo permit understanding of underlying mechanisms. Detection of subtle physiological alterations in brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis can be explored, that occur during environmental stimulation, exercise and ageing. Here, we have collected achievements in the field of basic research on applications of cytometry, including automated imaging for quantification of morphological or fluorescence-based parameters in cell cultures, towards imaging of three-dimensional brain architecture together with DNA content and proliferation data. Multi-parameter and more recently in vivo flow cytometry procedures, have been developed for quantification of phenotypic diversity and cell processes that occur during brain development as well as in adulthood, with importance for therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Abstract Crisis intervention services are now widely recognized as an efficacious treatment modality for the provision of emergency mental health care to individuals and groups. During the course of a lifetime, all people experience a variety of personal traumas, such as divorce or illness, while many others will also live through cataclysmic events, such as natural disasters or acts of violence, that result in a state of crisis. Although exposure to traumatic stressors can trigger adverse, long-term effects that can become extremely difficult to resolve without the timely delivery of effective, psychological intervention, crisis states can also provide an avenue for personal growth. This chapter presents a summary of the historical highlights and the theoretical influences on the development of modem crisis intervention theory. An overview of solution focused therapy, cognitive therapy, and other useful techniques are presented along with the differences and similarities in the delivery of emergency mental health services to individuals and groups. Case examples are used to illustrate the implementation of specific assessments and interventions in providing crisis intervention services. A general framework for collaborating with law enforcement and other agencies providing emergency care providers is presented. Cultural considerations in the context of a crisis, current research, and relevant legal issues are reviewed.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - A nine-month-old Labrador retriever was referred to the Clinica Veterinaria Privata San Marco because of frequent headshaking and downward turning of the right ear. Clinical examination revealed that there was no external acoustic meatus in the right ear. Computed tomography confirmed that the vertical part of the right auditory canal ended blindly, providing a diagnosis of external auditory canal atresia. Cytological examination and culture of fluid from the canal and the bulla revealed only aseptic cerumen; for this reason, it was assumed that the dog was probably affected by a congenital developmental deformity of the external auditory canal. Reconstructive surgery was performed using a ?pull-through? technique. Four months after surgery the cosmetic and functional results were satisfactory.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper reports an investigation into the accuracy and effectiveness of two (2) senior Australian radiographers in the reporting of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs in the adult trauma situation. and discusses the international debate on radiographer role extension into plain film reporting. The study of 540 patients referred to a large metropolitan emergency imaging department demonstrated high rates of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity = 98.00% specificity = 99.11%) in the assessment of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs. 294 out of 300 positive examinations were identified correctly (FPR=0.88%) as were 225 out of 227 negative or normal examinations (FNR=2.00%). A discussion on relevant statistical measures and their definitions is outlined. In the study radiologist reports are used as the comparative gold standard. The findings demonstrate an ability of clinically experienced radiographers to accurately and effectively provide diagnostic opinions on musculoskeletal radiographs. A formalised approach to radiographer reporting can be justified and a formal program to train appropriately experienced radiographers is recommended.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - De novo mutations (DNM) in SYNGAP1, encoding Ras/Rap GTPase-activating protein SynGAP, have been reported in individuals with nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID). We identified 10 previously unreported individuals with SYNGAP1 DNM; seven via the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) Study, one through clinical analysis for copy number variation and the remaining two (monozygotic twins) via a research multi-gene panel analysis. Seven of the nine heterozygous mutations are likely to result in loss-of-function (3 nonsense; 3 frameshift; 1 whole gene deletion). The remaining two mutations, one of which affected the monozygotic twins, were missense variants. Each individual carrying a DNM in SYNGAP1 had moderate-to-severe ID and 7/10 had epilepsy; typically myoclonic seizures, absences or drop attacks. 8/10 had hypotonia, 5/10 had significant constipation, 7/10 had wide-based/unsteady gait, 3/10 had strabismus, and 2/10 had significant hip dysplasia. A proportion of the affected individuals had a similar, myopathic facial appearance, with broad nasal bridge, relatively long nose and full lower lip vermilion. A distinctive behavioral phenotype was also observed with aggressive/challenging behavior and significant sleep problems being common. 7/10 individuals had MR imaging of the brain each of which was reported as normal. The clinical features of the individuals reported here show significant overlap with those associated with 6p21.3 microdeletions, confirming that haploinsufficiency for SYNGAP1 is responsible for both disorders. ? 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The cuprizone model of demyelination is well established in the mouse as a tool for the study of the mechanisms of both demyelination and remyelination. It is often desirable, however, to have a larger model, such as the rat, especially for imaging-based studies, yet initial work has failed to show demyelination in cuprizone-fed rats. Several recent studies have demonstrated demyelination in the rat, but only in the corpus callosum. In this study, we acquired high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the whole brain every 2 weeks, using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo imaging sequence, optimized for myelin contrast, in order to assess myelination across the entire rat brain over a period of 8 weeks on a 1% cuprizone diet. We observed a consistent pattern of demyelination, beginning in the cerebellum by 4 weeks and involving more rostral regions of the brain by 8 weeks on the cuprizone diet, with validation using Luxol fast blue histology. This imaging technique permits the effects of cuprizone-induced demyelination to be followed longitudinally in a single animal, over the entire brain. In turn, this may facilitate the establishment of the cuprizone model of demyelination in the rat.
