AB  - The cuprizone model of demyelination is well established in the mouse as a tool for the study of the mechanisms of both demyelination and remyelination. It is often desirable, however, to have a larger model, such as the rat, especially for imaging-based studies, yet initial work has failed to show demyelination in cuprizone-fed rats. Several recent studies have demonstrated demyelination in the rat, but only in the corpus callosum. In this study, we acquired high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the whole brain every 2 weeks, using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo imaging sequence, optimized for myelin contrast, in order to assess myelination across the entire rat brain over a period of 8 weeks on a 1% cuprizone diet. We observed a consistent pattern of demyelination, beginning in the cerebellum by 4 weeks and involving more rostral regions of the brain by 8 weeks on the cuprizone diet, with validation using Luxol fast blue histology. This imaging technique permits the effects of cuprizone-induced demyelination to be followed longitudinally in a single animal, over the entire brain. In turn, this may facilitate the establishment of the cuprizone model of demyelination in the rat.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the use of a new 3D high-resolution imaging technique dedicated to functional vessels for a systematic quantitative study of angiogenesis in the primate cortex. We present a new method which permits, using synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography imaging, the identification of micro-vascular components as well as their automatic numerical digitalization and extraction from very large 3D image analysis and post-treatments. This method is used to analyze various levels of micro-vascular organization and their postnatal modifications. Comparing newborn- and adult marmosets, we found an increase in vascular volume (270%), exchange surface (260%) and vessel length (290%) associated to a decrease in distances between vessel and tissue (32%). The increase in relative vascular volumes between the two ages, examined through the whole cortical depth, has been found to be mainly sustained by events occurring at the capillary level, and only marginally at the perforating vessel level. This work shows that the postnatal cortical maturation classically described in terms of synaptogenesis, gliogenesis and connectivity plasticity is accompanied by an intensive remodeling of micro-vascular patterns.

AB  - Summary The plasma proteins are a significant contributor to the total weak acid concentration as a net anionic charge. Due to potential species difference, species-specific values must be confirmed for the weak acid anionic concentrations of proteins (Atot) and the effective dissociation constant for plasma weak acids (Ka). We studied the net anion load Atot of equine plasma protein in 10 clinically healthy mature Standardbred horses. A multi-step titration procedure, using a tonometer covering a titration range of PCO2 from 25 to 145 mmHg at 37°C, was applied on the plasma of these 10 horses. Blood gases (pH, PCO2) and electrolytes required to calculate the strong ion difference ([SID] = [(Na++K++Ca2++Mg2+)-(Cl?+Lac+PO42-)]) were simultaneously measured over a physiological pH range from 6.90?7.55. A nonlinear regression iteration to determine Atot and Ka was performed using polygonal regression curve fitting applied to the electrical neutrality equation of the physico-chemical system. The average anion-load Atot for plasma protein of 10 Standardbred horses was 14.89 ± 0.8 mEq/l plasma and Ka was 2.11 ± 0.50 ? 10?7 Eq/l (pKa = 6.67). The derived conversion factor (iterated Atot concentration/average plasma protein concentration) for calculation of Atot in plasma is 0.21 mEq/g protein (protein-unit: g/l). This value compares closely with the 0.24 mEq/g protein determined by titration of Van Slyke et al. (1928) and 0.22 mEq/g protein recently published by Constable (1997) for horse plasma. The Ka value compares closely with the value experimentally determined by Constable in 1997 (2.22 ? 107 Eq/l). Linear regression of a set of experimental data from 5 Thoroughbred horses on a treadmill exercise test, showed excellent correlation with the regression lines not different from identity for the calculated and measured variables pH, HCO3 and SID. Knowledge of Atot and Ka for the horse is useful especially in exercise studies and in clinical conditions to quantify the mechanisms of the acid-base disturbances occurring.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the possible association between caudal fossa area and cervical vertebral dimensions and the presence of syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels. Methods: From magnetic resonance imaging scans of 78 cavalier King Charles spaniels, measurements were made of the widest vertical spinal width at C1/C2, C2, C2/C3 and C3; angulation of the C2/C3 spine; and estimated caudal fossa area. A correlation between these measurements and syringomyelia was sought. Results: A total of 59 dogs with and 19 without syringomyelia were compared. Older dogs had a significantly higher incidence of syringo-myelia. No difference in incidence was noted between genders. There was no significant difference in vertebral canal width at C1/C2 and C2, or angulation of C2/C3 between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups. The width of the canal at C2/C3 and C3 was significantly increased in syringomyelia dogs. There was no significant difference in the caudal fossa area between groups. Clinical Significance: Although syringomyelia was shown to be more prevalent in older dogs, the age beyond which dogs were considered at greater risk was not deducible from the dataset. The association identified between wider spinal canal at C3, and C2/C3 and syringomyelia presence is of questionable clinical significance, as the difference between syringomyelia and non-syringomyelia groups is too small to be measured in a clinical setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia that is a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. Brain function impairments have been identified in this disorder, mainly in the frontal and posterior cortical regions. However, the anatomical support for these dysfunctions remains poorly understood. We investigated gray matter thickness, gray matter volume, and white matter integrity in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Twenty-four patients with polysomnography-confirmed idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and 42 healthy individuals underwent a 3-tesla structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging examination using corticometry, voxel-based morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging. In the patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, decreased cortical thickness was observed in the frontal cortex, the lingual gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus. Gray matter volume was reduced in the superior frontal sulcus only. Patients showed no increased gray matter thickness or volume. Diffusion tensor imaging analyses revealed no significant white matter differences between groups. Using corticometry in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, several new cortical regions with gray matter alterations were identified, similar to those reported in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. These findings provide some anatomical support for previously identified brain function impairments in this disorder. ? 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - OBJECTIVE To supplement recent reports of computed tomographic (CT) findings in dogs and cats with grass seed foreign bodies. METHODS Retrospective review of cases that had CT scan and subsequent retrieval of a grass seed during the same period of hospitalisation from a site included in the scan. RESULTS Records of 44 dogs and 10 cats were reviewed. Most were presented in the months July to December. Median duration of clinical signs was 4 weeks (range 2 days to 2 years). The most frequent clinical signs were soft tissue swelling (30% cases), coughing (28%), sneezing (28%) and discharge (26%). Grass seeds were retrieved from the thorax (35% cases), nasal cavity (31%), ear (7%), other sites in the head and neck (22%), sublumbar muscles (2%) and pelvic limb (2%). The grass seed was visible in CT images in 10 (19%) cases. Secondary lesions were visible in CT images of 52 (96%) cases, including collection of exudate (37%), abscess (24%), enlarged lymph nodes (22%) and pulmonary consolidation (20%). CT images appeared normal in 4% animals. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Grass seeds within the respiratory tract are frequently visible in CT images, but in general CT appears to be more useful for localisation of secondary lesions than as a method of definite diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective? The aim of this paper was to analyse the results of treatment of anal fistulas retrospectively. Methods? Between 1992 and 2004, 407 patients were operated on for perianal fistula. In the follow-up period, 107 patients were lost, so 300 patients were analysed in the study. The mean follow-up time was 4.2?years. Analysed parameters included: types of surgical procedures in different kinds of fistulas and postoperative complications. Various types of surgical procedures and their effectiveness were described. Late results were assessed taking into account healing time, duration of sick leave, recurrence rate and incidence of anal sphincter dysfunction. Severity of gas and stool incontinence was assessed according to the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score. Results? In our study, subcutaneous fistula was diagnosed in 23.3%, inter-sphincteric in 18%, trans-sphincteric in 37.7%, supra-sphincteric in 16% and extra-sphincteric in 5% of patients. Single-tract fistulas were present in 88.7% and multi-tract fistulas were present in 11.3%. Overall, 242 patients had primary fistulas and 58 patients had recurrent fistulas. The most frequently performed procedures were cutting seton (139 patients) and radical fistulectomy (104 patients). Recurrent fistulas developed in 14.3%. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence was noticed in 10.7%. The recurrence rate was 5.4% in patients with primary fistula and in 51.7% patients presenting with a recurrent fistula. Gas and stool incontinence developed in 3.7% of patients with primary fistulas and in 39.7% of patients presenting with recurrent fistulas. Recurrence rate was 12% in the patients of single-tract fistulas and 32.4% in the patients of multi-tract fistulas. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence occurred in 8.3% of patients of single-tract fistulas and in 29.4% of patients of multi-tract fistulas. Conclusions? The complication rate was 10-fold higher in patients presenting with a recurrent fistula than in those with primary fistulas and threefold higher in patients with multi-tract fistulas than in those with single-tract fistulas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hindfoot arthritis is an important contributor to foot pain and physical disability. While the subtalar joint (STJ) is most frequently affected, anatomical variants such as facet configuration were suggested to further STJ cartilage deterioration. T2* mapping enables detection of ultra-structural cartilage change, particularly in thin cartilage layers, but its feasibility in the STJ has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmentation consistency and inter-scan short-term precision error of T2* mapping of talocalcaneal cartilage and to investigate the relationship between facet configuration and STJ T2* values. Using 3Tesla morphological magnetic resonance imaging, STJ configuration was categorized according to the degree of fusion between anterior, medial, or posterior facets. Subsequently, two repeats of multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequences were performed to obtain T2* maps with repositioning. Segmentation consistency of T2* values attained an ICC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.69?0.99). Precision errors comprised a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging 0.01?0.05, corresponding to a root mean square CV of 0.03?0.04. A 2-joint configuration type (i.e., fused anterior-medial facets) was significantly associated with a decrease in posterior facet T2* values (??=??0.6, p?=?0.046). STJ T2* mapping is a reliable method requiring at least a 4% difference within people to enable detection of significant change. Anatomical variants in STJ configuration were associated with T2* values with the more stable 3-joint types exhibiting more favorable cartilage outcomes. Longer-term larger-scaled studies focusing on arthritis pathology are needed to further support the use of T2* mapping in hindfoot disease monitoring. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - An approximately eight-year-old female grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was presented with a two months history of blindness. The radiographic examination showed a dilatation of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut. Ophthalmoscopy and electroretinography revealed degeneration of the retina. A proventricular dilatation disease was suspected. The bird was euthanased because of deteriorating condition and poor prognosis. The pathological examination showed an atrophy of the ventricular muscles and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the myenteric plexus of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut as well as moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the cerebrum with moderate neuronophagia. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the retina, indicating proventricular dilatation disease, and subsequent retinal degeneration were found. A potential common aetiology for proventricular dilatation disease and blindness is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the short-term clinical performance of an anatomically pre-contoured, locking plate in dogs undergoing tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) for cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) disease. Study Design Prospective, multi-center clinical study. Animals Dogs (n?=?56) undergoing TPLO. Methods Signalment and operative data were recorded. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up tibial plateau angle (TPA) were measured from radiographic images. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded; the latter were categorized as minor if additional surgery was not necessary, and major if surgery was needed to resolve the complication. Bone healing was scored and change in tibial plateau angle (TPACH) between postoperative and follow up radiographic images was calculated. Results Mean (±SD) preoperative TPA was 28.6?±?3.8°, and mean postoperative TPA was 4.8?±?1.9°. Four intraoperative complications (7.1%) including 2 cases of intra-articular screw placement, 3 minor postoperative complications (5.4%), and no major or catastrophic postoperative complications occurred. Median bone healing grade was 4/4 (excellent union >75% healing). Mean TPACH was 0.15?±?1.32°. Conclusions Use of this anatomically contoured, locking TPLO plate by experienced surgeons is associated with accurate tibial plateau leveling, reliably excellent bone union at follow-up exam, minimal TPACH, and a lower complication rate than previously reported. Confining contouring to the distal shaft of the plate ensures there is precise apposition to the tibial diaphysis and mitigates the risk of intra-articular screw placement.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current state of the art computed tomography (CT) imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, including the hepatobiliary tree, pancreas, and hollow viscera, as well as ancillary techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) imaging and CT colonography. Intravenous (i.v.) contrast-enhanced images expand the diagnostic range of CT and have become essential for most clinical indications. Intravenous contrast enhancement can dramatically improve the visualization of pathological processes in virtually every facet of abdominal imaging, including the evaluation of the alimentary tract and the solid gastrointestinal organs. Many neoplastic and nonneoplastic gastrointestinal diseases can have associated peritoneal findings, which can be quite subtle. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is the best radiological modality to diagnose or characterize an abdominal wall hernia. The CT appearance of internal hernias, when bowel protrudes through an opening or defect in the mesentery or peritoneum, have been well described.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - A general factor (gp) at the apex of personality has been suggested to account for the correlations between the Big Five. Although the gp has received ample support from monomethod studies, results from studies incorporating different methods have remained rather ambiguous; some have identified a gp across different informants, whereas others have not. It was hypothesized that these divergent findings are a result of varying lengths of acquaintance between raters. To this end, the current study presents a multitrait multi-informant meta-analysis (total N?=?11?941) that found weak support for a gp as a substantive trait of personality. Evidence for a gp was susceptible to the length of acquaintance between informants. Although a gp could be identified for short-term acquaintances, it remained elusive at long-term acquaintance. Thus, the gp in other ratings more likely reflects normative ratings of an average individual rather than ratings of the specific target person.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal HD (pre-HD). Methods As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N?=?191 pre-HD individuals and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1?5 year follow-up) DWI, with n?=?649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory, and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. Results Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. Conclusions This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied to the onset of motor symptoms in HD.

AB  - Abstract The morphology of the brain and skull are important in the evaluation of the aging human; however, little is known about how the skull may change with age. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphological changes of the adult skull using three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of thousands of landmarks with the focus on anatomic regions that may be correlated with brain atrophy and head injury. Computed tomography data were collected between ages 20 and 100. Each scan was segmented using thresholding techniques. An atlas image of a 50th percentile skull was registered to each subject scan by computing a series of rigid, affine, and non-linear transformations between atlas space and subject space. Landmarks on the atlas skull were transformed to each subject and partitioned into the inner and outer cranial vault and the cranial fossae. A generalized Procrustes analysis was completed for the landmark sets. The coordinate locations describing the shape of each region were regressed with age to generate a model predicting the landmark location with age. Permutation testing was performed to assess significant changes with age. For the males, all anatomic regions reveal significant changes in shape with age except for the posterior cranial fossa. For the females, only the middle cranial fossa and anterior cranial fossa were found to change significantly in shape. Results of this study are important for understanding the adult skull and how shape changes may pertain to brain atrophy, aging, and injury.

AB  - Summary Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is a progressive and painful disease syndrome that affects aged horses. It affects incisor, canine and infrequently cheek teeth, and is characterised by gingival inflammation, oedema and recession, calculus deposition, feed accumulation, subgingival swellings with or without associated draining tracts, bulbous enlargement of teeth, tooth mobility, associated periodontal disease, tooth fracture and/or tooth loss. The aetiology of EOTRH is likely to be multi-factorial. However, histopathological findings consistently suggest an aetiological contribution of initial biomechanical stresses and strains, followed by secondary involvement of micro-organisms. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, age and radiographic changes including lytic changes, widening or loss of the periodontal ligament, hypercementosis, tooth fracture and alveolar bone loss. Treatment of EOTRH is not currently possible, but the condition can be managed to some degree, quite successfully for many years in some cases. However, the disease is progressive and invariably results in extraction of the tooth or teeth involved. The prognosis is most probably guarded at best and poor in most cases; however, complete removal of affected teeth carries a good prognosis for an improved quality of life in the short to medium term.
