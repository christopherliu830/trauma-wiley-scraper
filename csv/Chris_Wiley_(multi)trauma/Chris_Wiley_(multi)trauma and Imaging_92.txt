AB  - This article contains a description of the context, development and delivery of No kids in the middle, a group approach for divorced fighting parents and their children. After addressing the social and legal context of high conflict divorces, we describe the main characteristics of this destructive dynamic. We describe some aspects of the approach and give examples. Key principles for the project include: keeping the child in mind; working in groups; stopping legal processes; making free space for interactions; creative presentation ceremonies; and reaching out to the network. The outcomes are promising. Research on the project has started.

AB  - This retrospective study of 143 pediatric patients with unilateral acute scrotal disease was done to assess the value of duplex Doppler sonographic examination prior to puberty (110 patients) in comparison to a pubertal group (33 patients) in a pediatric hospital, where the examinations are done by staff radiologists and radiology residents of varying degrees of expertise and experience with Doppler technique. All patients seen during an 18 month period were included. The unaffected side was examined in most patients and served as control. The normal Doppler shift in the center of the prepubertal testis was found to be 0.2 to 0.5 kHz, when using a 5 MHz duplex Doppler probe. With puberty, the Doppler shift increased to 0.5 to 1 kHz. Of 18 patients (10 prepubertal) with testicular torsion, five (three prepubertal) had false-positive Doppler shift. In four of these five cases, faulty placement of the Doppler sample volume cursor was probably the cause. Using a multi-way frequency analysis, puberty was found to have no significant influence on results of Doppler signal (chi square = 0.1346; P = 0.7137). Duplex Doppler sonographic examination is as useful to rule out testicular torsion in prepubertal boys as it is after puberty. Meticulous technique is essential. The opposite side should be examined first and serves as control for the affected one. Results showing no flow in the center of the diseased testis with positive flow in the unaffected one should lead to further clinical action (scintigraphy or surgery).

AB  - Flaring of the ischiopubic synchondrosis at the time of fusion is a common clinical observation in pediatrics and represents a normal physiological process in skeletal maturation. When presenting unilaterally, this flaring can mimic a range of serious pathological conditions such as osteomyelitis, osteal tumors, and traumatic injury. An improved understanding of ischiopubic synchondrosis fusion is therefore critical to avoid potential misdiagnosis. Retrospective multi-slice computed tomography pelvic scans of Australian individuals aged neonate to 24?years (n?=?184) were assessed using a novel five stage morphological classification system of the maturation and fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis. Maturation scoring was conducted using both multiplanar formatting views and volume-rendered reconstructions in OsiriX?. Maturational stage was strongly related to age (P?<?0.001) with fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis observed between the ages of 4 and 9 years in females and 7 and 13?years for males. The highest probability of fusion in our Queensland Australian population based on multinomial regression predictive modeling was between 7 and 10 years of age. We documented three variants of fusion: pubic and ischial outgrowths, appearance of a secondary ossification center, and a fusiform-shaped enlargement. This study provides the first predictive modeling of the timing of fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis using a reliable morphological classification system. The significant variation in timing and progression of fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis reported in this study, will aid in minimizing misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment in children presenting with asymmetrical or delayed ischiopubic synchondrosis anomalies.

AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.

AB  - Purpose Unlike conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS), which only measures metabolite concentrations, multiparametric MRS also quantifies their longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, as well as the radiofrequency transmitter inhomogeneity (B1+). To test whether knowledge of these additional parameters can improve the clinical utility of brain MRS, we compare the conventional and multiparametric approaches in terms of expected classification accuracy in differentiating controls from patients with neurological disorders. Theory and Methods A literature review was conducted to compile metabolic concentrations and relaxation times in a wide range of neuropathologies and regions of interest. Simulations were performed to construct receiver operating characteristic curves and compute the associated areas (area under the curve) to examine the sensitivity and specificity of MRS for detecting each pathology in each region. Classification accuracy was assessed using metabolite concentrations corrected using population-averages for T1, T2, and B1+ (conventional MRS); using metabolite concentrations corrected using per-subject values (multiparametric MRS); and using an optimal linear multiparametric estimator comprised of the metabolites' concentrations and relaxation constants (multiparametric MRS). Additional simulations were conducted to find the minimal intra-subject precision needed for each parameter. Results Compared with conventional MRS, multiparametric approaches yielded area under the curve improvements for almost all neuropathologies and regions of interest. The median area under the curve increased by 0.14 over the entire dataset, and by 0.24 over the 10 instances with the largest individual increases. Conclusions Multiparametric MRS can substantially improve the clinical utility of MRS in diagnosing and assessing brain pathology, motivating the design and use of novel multiparametric sequences.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe diagnostic findings, complications, and long-term outcome of dogs with atlantoaxial instability (AAI) that had modified ventral stabilization with positively threaded profile pins and polymethylmethacrylate by 1 surgeon and to evaluate the potential prognostic indicators. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?49) with AAI. Methods Medical records (2000?2010) of dogs with AAI that had modified ventral stabilization were reviewed. Data on pre- and postoperative neurologic status, diagnostic findings, and outcomes were retrieved. Age, neurologic grade, duration of clinical abnormalities, dens abnormalities, and MRI findings were evaluated as the potential predictors for recovery. Age and cancellous bone grafting were evaluated as the potential predictors of postoperative pin breakage. Results Two dogs died during the perioperative period. In 47 dogs with follow up (median: 29 months; range, 4?110 months), 46 dogs (94%) improved neurologically after surgery, but 1 dog did not become ambulatory. There were no long term complications that resulted in serious neurologic deterioration or that required additional surgery. Partial pin breakage (1?5 pins) occurred in 16 dogs at 1?27.5 months (median, 5 months) without neurologic deterioration. Only the nonambulatory preoperative grade was significantly (P?=?.002) associated with non/incomplete recovery compared with ambulatory dogs. Conclusions Adequate stabilization of the vertebrae and improved neurologic status were achieved in most dogs with AAI using a modified ventral stabilization technique with positively threaded profile pins and polymethylmethacrylate.

AB  - Abstract Background Objective quantification of anatomical variations about the femur head?neck junction in pre-operative planning for surgical intervention in femoro-acetabular impingement is problematic, as no clear definition of average normal anatomy for a specific subject exists. Methods We have defined the normal-equivalent of a subject's anatomy by using a statistical shape model and geometric shape optimization for finding correspondences, while excluding the femoral head?neck junction during the fitting procedure. The presented technique was evaluated on a cohort of 20 patients. Results Difference in α-angle measurement between the actual morphology and the predicted normal-equivalent, averaged 1.3° (SD 1.7°) in the control group versus 8° (SD 7.3°) in the patient group (p < 0.05). Conclusions Defining normal equivalent anatomy is effective in quantifying anatomical dysmorphism of the femoral head?neck junction and as such can improve presurgical analysis of patients diagnosed with femoro-acetabular impingement.

AB  - Objective To report clinical findings, perioperative complications and long-term outcome in dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy surgery for treatment of neoplasia. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?84) and cats (16). Methods Medical records (January 2000 to December 2009) of dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy at participating institutions were reviewed. Postoperative progress and current status of the patient at the time of the study was determined by either medical record review, or via telephone contact with the referring veterinarian or owner. Results Complications were infrequent and usually minor. Hemorrhage was the main intraoperative complication; 2 dogs required blood transfusion. One dog developed an incisional hernia. In dogs, hemangiosarcoma had the worst prognosis with a median survival time (MST) of 179 days. MST for chondrosarcoma (1232 days), osteosarcoma (533 days), and soft tissue sarcoma (373 days) were not statistically different. Median disease-free interval (DFI) for local recurrence of all tumor types was 257 days. Cats had 75% survival at 1 year, which was significantly longer than dogs. Conclusions Survival times for most tumor types can be good, but surgical margins should be carefully evaluated to ensure complete tumor removal. Adjuvant therapies may be advisable particularly for dogs to reduce rates of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

AB  - Purpose To assess the feasibility of quantifying liver iron concentration (LIC) using and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) at a high field strength of 7 Tesla (T). Methods Five different concentrations of Fe-dextran were injected into 12 mice to produce various degrees of liver iron overload. After mice were sacrificed, blood and liver samples were harvested. Ferritin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were performed to quantify serum ferritin concentration and LIC. Multiecho gradient echo MRI was conducted to estimate and the magnetic susceptibility of each liver sample through complex nonlinear least squares fitting and a morphology enabled dipole inversion method, respectively. Results Average estimates of serum ferritin concentration, LIC, , and susceptibility all show good linear correlations with injected Fe-dextran concentration; however, the standard deviations in the estimates of and susceptibility increase with injected Fe-dextran concentration. Both and susceptibility measurements also show good linear correlations with LIC (R2?=?0.78 and R2?=?0.91, respectively), and a susceptibility-to-LIC conversion factor of 0.829?ppm/(mg/g wet) is derived. Conclusion The feasibility of quantifying LIC using MR-based and QSM at a high field strength of 7T is demonstrated. Susceptibility quantification, which is an intrinsic property of tissues and benefits from being field-strength independent, is more robust than quantification in this ex vivo study. A susceptibility-to-LIC conversion factor is presented that agrees relatively well with previously published QSM derived results obtained at 1.5T and 3T.

AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mid-term radiographic and functional outcomes of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) patients treated with the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) technique and to find predictive factors of clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective, single-center study was performed enrolling a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of TPF. All subjects were treated by ORIF between January 2010 and December 2015 at our level-1 healthcare trauma center. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 75?years; ORIF technique used for articular TPF, type 41-B and 41-C, isolated or with associated injuries. The patients were divided in two groups, according to fracture patterns and compared. Their characteristics, radiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Radiographs 12?months after surgery were evaluated for reduction and alignment, and radiographs at 24?months to describe post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and the American Knee Society score (AKSS) questionnaires. Return to work and sport activities were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, and the statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P <?0.05. Results Forty-five patients were included, 29 males and 16 females; the mean age was 54.5?years. The mean follow-up was 57.18?months (range, 26?94). There were AO 41-B fractures (partial articular fractures) in more than half of the patients (66.67%), while the remaining 15 had AO 41-C fractures (complete articular fractures). The sub-type AO 41-B3 was the most common, reported in 62.22% of patients. The mean KOOS score was 69.0. Mean AKSS and SF-36 PCS scores were 79.0 and 41.4, respectively. There were significant relationships between age and functional results (KOOS ADL, Sport, QoL, and SF-36 PCS) and between BMI and KOOS Pain, ADL, Sport, and QoL. No differences were found between the two types of fractures regarding quality of reduction and alignment. AO 41-C TPF tend to develop PTOA more frequently with respect to 41-B fractures, while type AO 41-C TPF had the worst clinical outcomes. We found that the presence of an articular step-off and the malalignment of the tibial axis after surgery were predictive of daily pain felt by patients. PTOA was predictive of a worse AKSS. The overall complication rate was 13.33%: 1 superficial wound infection, 1 deep vein thrombosis, and 4 cases of transitory deficit of the common peroneal nerve. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that early radiographic features may be predictive for pain perceived by patients at mid-term follow-up.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina brought to the surface serious questions about the capacity of the public health system to respond to community-wide disaster. The storm and its aftermath severed developmentally protective family and community ties; thus its consequences are expected to be particularly acute for vulnerable adolescents. Research confirms that teens are at risk for a range of negative outcomes under conditions of life stress and family disorganization. Specifically, the multiple interacting risk factors for substance abuse in adolescence may be compounded when families and communities have experienced a major trauma. Further, existing service structures and treatments for working with young disaster victims may not address their risk for co-occurring substance abuse and traumatic stress reactions because they tend to be individually or peer group focused, and fail to consider the multi-systemic aspects of disaster recovery. This article proposes an innovative family-based intervention for young disaster victims, based on an empirically supported model for adolescent substance abuse, Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT; Liddle, 2002). Outcomes and mechanisms of the model?s effects are being investigated in a randomized clinical trial with clinically referred substance-abusing teens in a New Orleans area community impacted by Hurricane Katrina.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate alternative management strategies for anterior table frontal sinus fractures involving the frontal sinus outflow tract. Study Design A prospective cohort of patients with anterior table frontal sinus fracture with frontal outflow tract involvement documented by computed tomography (CT) scan was examined between 1999 and 2001. Methods A select group of patients with anterior table frontal sinus fracture involving the frontal outflow tract was treated with open reduction of bony fracture without osteoplastic obliteration of the frontal sinus. Serial CT scans were obtained starting at 8 weeks after injury. Patients with persistent frontal sinus obstruction after medical treatment underwent an extended endoscopic frontal sinusotomy or a modified endoscopic Lothrop procedure. Results Fourteen patients sustained frontal sinus fractures and were treated during the study period. Seven patients were included in the modified treatment algorithm, with a mean follow-up of 18 months. All patients had concurrent facial fractures: superior orbital rim (n = 5), naso-orbital?ethmoid complex (n = 2), mandible (n = 2), and midface (n = 2). All 7 patients underwent open repair of the facial fractures. Postoperatively, 5 patients had spontaneous frontal sinus ventilation. Two patients, both of whom had naso-orbito?ethmoid fractures, had persistent frontal sinus obstruction clinically and radiographically. These patients were successfully managed with an endoscopic frontal sinus procedure. Conclusions A select group of patients with frontal sinus and outflow tract fracture may be managed with open repair of the anterior table fracture without obliteration. In these cases, suspected frontal outflow tract obstruction can be managed expectantly. Failed frontal sinus ventilation may require endoscopic frontal sinus surgery to reestablish mucociliary clearance.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Successful treatment and prevention of kidney disease in dogs requires a multi-dimensional approach to identify and eliminate causes or exacerbating factors, provide professional evaluation on a regular basis and implement a comprehensive treatment programme when necessary. Over the years, many therapeutic and preventive interventions have been developed or advocated for chronic kidney disease in dogs, but evidence of efficacy or effectiveness is often lacking or highly variable. Accordingly, the main objective of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence supporting various aspects of managing canine chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Aims:? Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder manifesting with heterogeneous symptom clusters and clinical presentations. The deficit syndrome is the condition defined by the existence of primarily negative symptoms, and patients with the deficit syndrome differ from non-deficit patients on measures of brain structure and function. In the current study, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated the frontotemporal connectivity that is hypothesized to differ between deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. The patients had deficit (n?=?11) or non-deficit (n?=?18) schizophrenia and they were evaluated clinically with the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Diffusion-based images were obtained with a 1.5T Siemens Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine and analyses were carried out with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Library Software ? Diffusion tool box software. Results:? The fractional anisotropy values in the left uncinate fasciculus of schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome were lower than those of non-deficit patients and the controls. There were no differences between non-deficit schizophrenia patients and controls. Conclusion:? These findings provide evidence of left uncinate fasciculus damage resulting in disrupted communication between orbitofrontal prefrontal areas and temporal areas in deficit schizophrenia patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To describe the anatomy of congenital portosystemic shunts involving the left colic vein in dogs and cats. METHODS Retrospective review of a consecutive series of dogs and cats managed for congenital portosystemic shunts. For inclusion a shunt involving the left colic vein with recorded intraoperative mesenteric portovenography or computed tomography angiography along with direct gross surgical observations at the time of surgery was required. RESULTS Six dogs and three cats met the inclusion criteria. All cases had a shunt which involved a distended left colic vein. The final communication with a systemic vein was variable; in seven cases (five dogs, two cats) it was via the caudal vena cava, in one cat it was via the common iliac vein and in the remaining dog it was via the internal iliac vein. In addition, two cats showed caudal vena cava duplication. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The morphology of this shunt type appeared to be a result of an abnormal communication between either the left colic vein or the cranial rectal vein and a pelvic systemic vein (caudal vena cava, common iliac vein or internal iliac vein). This information may help with surgical planning in cases undergoing shunt closure surgery.
