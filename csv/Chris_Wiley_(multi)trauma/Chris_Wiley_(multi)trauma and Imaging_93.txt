AB  - Abstract Recently there has been an increase in interest in the relationship between stress and memory. Brain regions which are involved in memory function also effect the stress response. Traumatic stress results in changes in these brain regions; alterations in these brain regions in turn may mediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural mechanisms which are relevant to the effects of stress on memory, such as fear conditioning, stress sensitization, and extinction, are reviewed in relation to their implications for PTSD. Special topics including neural mechanisms in dissociation, neurobiological approaches to the validity of childhood memories as they apply to controversies over the ?False Memory Syndrome,? and implications of the effects of stress on memory for psychotherapy, are also reviewed. The findings discussed in this paper are consistent with the formulation that stress-induced alterations in brain regions and systems involved in memory may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD, as well as dissociative amnesia, seen in survivors of traumatic stress.

AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of single- and two-segment fusion for Denis type B spinal fracture. Methods Two female patients with Denis type B L1 vertebral fractures were studied. Both patients had achieved intervertebral fusion by 1 year postoperatively, at which time CT data were collected, including data of one patient before and after removal of pedicle screws and of another whose pedicle screws were not removed. The data were imported into Mimics software and T11-L2 three dimensional models established. After construction of the models, they were imported into ANSYS software. An axial load (260?N) and 10?Nm torque were loaded to simulate the flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of the spine, respectively. Results There was no significant difference in the average displacement of the spine motion between the two-segment and single-segment fusion patients without removal of pedicle screws. However, for all motion forms, the average displacement of the single-segment fusion patient' spine after removal of pedicle screws was significantly greater than that before removal of pedicle screws and that of the two-segment fusion patient. The average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of two-segment fusion patient was significantly greater than that of the one-segment fusion patient. Moreover, the average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of single-segment fusion patient was greater before than after removal of pedicle screws. Conclusion Provided there is satisfactory interbody fusion, removal of pedicle screws after one-segment fusion can increase spinal motion, reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral discs and delay disc degeneration.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact-finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi-component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non-core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that ?herd immunity? is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non-governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the everyday life conditions experienced by older migrants and their reasons for specific age- and health-related behaviour during the conduct of everyday life. The study comprised 16 qualitative interviews with migrants aged 56?96 years from Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq and Somalia. The three themes that emerged from the conditions, meanings and reasons analysis illustrated that the older persons were trapped in various ways ?without language, in fragmented families and in an unfamiliar structure. We identified these themes as The importance of the life history, Lost in language barriers and Having a national sense of belonging. The main findings emphasise the vulnerability of older migrants in a resettlement country. With an unclear national identity and without the local language, older migrants struggle to develop a clear vision of their role in a minority community in a foreign country. Besides language skills and the need for interpreters, health professionals need to consider issues such as life history, traumas and national belonging when their usual approaches to managing health-related topics have failed.

AB  - Myelin plays a critical role in proper neuronal function by providing trophic and metabolic support to axons and facilitating energy-efficient saltatory conduction. Myelination is influenced by numerous molecules including growth factors, hormones, transmembrane receptors and extracellular molecules, which activate signaling cascades that drive cellular maturation. Key signaling molecules and downstream signaling cascades controlling myelination have been identified in cell culture systems. However, in vitro systems are not able to faithfully replicate the complex in vivo signaling environment that occurs during development or following injury. Currently, it remains time-consuming and expensive to investigate myelination in vivo in rodents, the most widely used model for studying mammalian myelination. As such, there is a need for alternative in vivo myelination models, particularly ones that can test molecular mechanisms without removing oligodendrocyte lineage cells from their native signaling environment or disrupting intercellular interactions with other cell types present during myelination. Here, we review the ever-increasing role of zebrafish in studies uncovering novel mechanisms controlling vertebrate myelination. These innovative studies range from observations of the behavior of single cells during in vivo myelination as well as mutagenesis- and pharmacology-based screens in whole animals. Additionally, we discuss recent efforts to develop novel models of demyelination and oligodendrocyte cell death in adult zebrafish for the study of cellular behavior in real time during repair and regeneration of damaged nervous systems.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar abortus equi (S. abortus equi) is well known as the aetiological agent of equine abortion. However, abortion caused by S. abortus equi has not been previously described in donkeys. Objectives To investigate whether S. abortus equi was correlated with an abortion outbreak consisting of 61 abortions. Study design Investigation of the clinical cases using pathoanatomical, bacteriological, serological and molecular approaches. Methods Autopsies on nine aborted foetuses were performed. Tissue specimens from seven aborted foetuses and two mares were cultured and subjected to detection of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1), equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) by polymerase chain reaction. The isolates were serotyped according to the Kaufmann?White scheme and analysed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Detection of EHV and EAV antibodies was performed in all pregnant mares. Results No obvious gross lesions were observed in the foetuses. Nine Gram-negative isolates were obtained from all nine tissue samples and were identified as Salmonella spp. All of the isolates belonged to the B group, the O antigen epitope was 4, 12 and H antigen was not obtained. The isolates of Salmonella were characterised as sequence type (ST) 251. Detection of EHV-1, EHV-4 and EAV was negative. Main limitations The mechanism that causes abortion in donkeys needs further study and the lack of histological examination. Conclusion Salmonella abortus equi was isolated as the single agent and was responsible for the abortions. Equine practitioners should be aware of S. abortus equi infection as a cause of abortion in donkeys.

AB  - This position paper proposes a modeling pipeline to develop clinically relevant neuromusculoskeletal models to understand and treat complex neurological disorders. Although applicable to a variety of neurological conditions, we provide direct pipeline applicative examples in the context of cerebral palsy (CP). This paper highlights technologies in: (1) patient-specific segmental rigid body models developed from magnetic resonance imaging for use in inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics pipelines; (2) efficient population-based approaches to derive skeletal models and muscle origins/insertions that are useful for population statistics and consistent creation of continuum models; (3) continuum muscle descriptions to account for complex muscle architecture including spatially varying material properties with muscle wrapping; (4) muscle and tendon properties specific to CP; and (5) neural-based electromyography-informed methods for muscle force prediction. This represents a novel modeling pipeline that couples for the first time electromyography extracted features of disrupted neuromuscular behavior with advanced numerical methods for modeling CP-specific musculoskeletal morphology and function. The translation of such pipeline to the clinical level will provide a new class of biomarkers that objectively describe the neuromusculoskeletal determinants of pathological locomotion and complement current clinical assessment techniques, which often rely on subjective judgment.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Contamination and infection of synovial cavities are a common occurrence in clinical practice and, if inadequately treated, may have career or life threatening consequences for affected horses. Hypothesis: The objectives in treating contamination and infection of joints, tendon sheaths and bursae are most effectively met by endoscopic surgery. Methods: Over a 6 year period, cases of synovial contamination and infection admitted to a referral clinic were evaluated and treated endoscopically. The horses received local and systemic antimicrobial drugs with minimal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication but no other medical or surgical treatment. All arthroscope and instrument portals and, when ever possible, all traumatic wounds were closed. Diagnostic information, endoscopic observations and results of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 140 affected animals were referred and 121 cases were treated endoscopically. These involved 70 joints, 29 tendon sheaths, 10 bursae and in 12 cases a combination of synovial cavities. The most common aetiologies were open wounds (n = 54) and self-sealing punctures (n = 41). Foreign material was identified endoscopically in 41 but predicted prior to surgery in only 6 cases. Osteochondral lesions were evident at surgery in 51 and recognised before surgery in 25 cases; 32 horses had intrathecal tendon or ligament defects. Follow-up information was obtained for 118 animals; 106 (90%) survived and 96 (81%) returned to their preoperative level of performance. The presence of osteitis/osteomyelitis, other osteochondral lesions and marked deposits of pannus were associated with nonsurvival. For those animals which survived, non-Thoroughbred horses, a combination of synovial structure involvement and regional i.v. antimicrobial administration were associated with reduced post operative performance. Marked pannus, regional i.v. antimicrobial administration and duration of systemic antimicrobial administration were associated with a group combining nonsurviving animals and those with reduced post operative performance. Conclusions: Endoscopic surgery makes a valuable contribution to the management of synovial contamination and infection. Potential relevance: The information obtained from and therapeutic options offered by endoscopy justify its early use in cases of synovial contamination and infection.

AB  - A 24-week-old dog was presented with recurrent rectal prolapse because of colonic duplication. Colonic duplication is an extremely uncommon congenital abnormality, with only six cases reported in veterinary medicine, one diagnosed at necropsy and five after barium enema, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy either alone or in combination. In this case, these techniques failed to identify the abnormality and diagnosis was ultimately achieved via negative contrast computed tomography. The evaluation generated by the computed tomography images allowed a refined surgical approach. To the authors? knowledge, negative contrast computed tomography has not yet been reported in the veterinary literature to diagnose gastrointestinal pathologies. Colonic duplication in this case was treated by removal of the intercolonic septum via colotomy.

AB  - Objectives: The efficacy of maropitant (Cerenia?; Pfizer Inc.) as an anti-emetic for use in dogs with ongoing emesis was evaluated in a two-phase multi-centric study conducted at veterinary clinics in France, Italy, Slovakia and the UK. Methods: In phase I, dogs with ongoing emesis were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either maropitant (32 dogs) or metoclopramide (34 dogs). In phase II, dogs were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to maropitant (77 dogs) or metoclopramide (40 dogs). Maropitant was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg/day for up to five days. Metoclopramide was administered as recommended on the product labels as licensed at 0·5 to 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously or orally with the daily dose divided over two to three administrations per day for up to three to five days. Results: In phase I, 97 per cent of dogs treated with maropitant and 71 per cent of dogs treated with metoclopramide did not vomit after treatment (P<0·01). The mean number of emetic events after maropitant treatment was significantly reduced compared with that after metoclopramide treatment (P=0·01). In phase II, the occurrence of emesis was lower for maropitant during the first 24 hours (P<0·0001) and for each day thereafter. Clinical Significance: A single daily dose of maropitant was more effective than metoclopramide administered two or three times daily in the treatment of emesis caused by various aetiologies in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Hypoattenuating ocular lenses on CT have been described with cataract formation in humans, however published studies are currently lacking regarding this finding in veterinary patients. The purpose of this retrospective and prospective study was to describe the varying CT appearances of the ocular lens in vivo, and investigate the causes for CT density variations in a population of cats and dogs. A total of 102 canine and feline patients with CT of the head acquired at the authors? hospital between May 2011 and March 2019 were included. A bilateral hypoattenuating halo surrounding an isoattenuating to mildly hypoattenuating core was described in the ocular lens center of every cat in which a Philips brand proprietary image construction filter was used. A similar but more varied hypoattenuating region was noted in the lenses of 45.8% of dogs where the same filter was applied, as well as 43.8% of dogs with a second, similar filter. Ophthalmic examination of three live cats and one dog with hypoattenuating lenses demonstrated normal lens translucency, excluding the presence of cataract. The effect of different proprietary filters on lens appearance was also described in three fresh cadavers with normal lenses identified on ophthalmic, macroscopic, and microscopic examination. Etiology of the hypoattenuating areas within the ocular lens was not conclusively determined. Recognition that such a variant may be seen in the absence of cataract is important, in order to prevent misdiagnosis.

AB  - Abstract? Diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy is characterized by axonal degeneration and regeneration as well as by Schwann cell and microvascular changes. These changes have been described at both the light (LM) and the electron microscopic (EM) levels; however, EM has not been applied to large clinical trials. Our goal was to adapt the rigorous techniques used for quantifying human biopsies with LM image analysis to accommodate ultrastructural analyses. We applied digital image capture and analysis to the ultrastructural examination of axons in sural nerve biopsies from diabetic patients enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial. The selection of sural nerve biopsies was based on the quality of specimen fixation, absence of physical distortion, and nerve fascicle size (≥100?000; ≤425?000?µm2). Thin sections were collected on formvar-coated slot grids, stabilized with carbon and scanned on a Phillips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Digital images were captured with a Kodak Megaplus 1.6 camera. A montage was constructed using software derived from aerial mapping applications, and this virtual image was viewed by EM readers. Computer-assisted analyses included identification and labeling of individual axons and axons within regenerating clusters. The average density of regenerating myelinated axon clusters per mm2 was 65.8?±?5.1, range of 0?412 (n?=?193). These techniques increase the number of samples that may be analyzed by EM and extend the use of this technique to clinical trials using tissue biopsies as a primary endpoint.

One of these initiatives is a DVD entitled Thaddeus O'Sullivan: The Early Films, 1974?1985, produced and released in conjunction with an academic study. The other is a multi-part film exhibition programme, Absences and (Im)possibilities: Traces of an Experimental Cinema in Ireland, curated by the Dublin-based Experimental Film Club and distributed by LUX, a London-based international agency for the support and promotion of artists moving image. These two initiatives, addressing a diverse audience that includes Irish cinema scholars and those engaged in moving image production, provide diverse vantage points from which to reconsider histories and legacies of this First Wave of indigenous Irish filmmaking.

AB  - Abstract Lateral root perforation unnoticed during post-space preparation, and followed by post cementation, can subsequently be challenging to diagnose in the labio-lingual plane due to the two-dimensional nature of conventional radiography. This paper demonstrates the application of a recently developed three-dimensional imaging system, cone beam computed tomography, in the diagnosis of iatrogenic root perforation. A clinical case is reported where labial post perforation in a maxillary central incisor occurring 15 years previously presented with a sinus tract and radiolucent lesion. Non-surgical retreatment and perforation repair using mineral trioxide aggregate was performed with the aid of an operating microscope. The sinus tract resolved with radiographic evidence of healing at 1-year recall.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the way in which the ?project? for Moscow as the capital was shown on film before the architectural designs were actually implemented, using cinema as testing ground for the Grand Reconstruction under Stalin during the 1930s. It sketches the changes and shifts in the representation of Moscow in post-war cinema, before analyzing the images of Moscow in contemporary, post-Soviet cinema. The chapter presents that Moscow was never just a shooting location: rather, cinema has projected the city as it should be onto the silver screen, and rarely, only episodically, does the real Moscow appear in film. It attempts to demonstrate this ?loss of face? that the city undergoes in the new millennium, if not in architectural terms, then at least in its screen representation. With the demise of the communist state and, more importantly, the collapse of the Soviet dream of socialism, an entire value system vanished.

AB  - Background:?? With the use of the three-point lap-diagonal seat belt restraint there has been a reduction in the number of deaths caused by automobile trauma. However, with the use of a restraint, a new pattern of injuries has emerged. The ?seat-belt syndrome? comprises a constellation of injuries including soft tissue injury to the breast. Given that seat-belt legislation is becoming more widespread, it is likely that the incidence and reporting of these injuries will become more common. In this paper, we provide an overview of the reported literature regarding three-point lap-diagonal seat belt injury to the female breast. We then discuss the previously unreported area of breast reconstruction in a breast deformed as a result of blunt trauma, using a specific case as an example. Methods:?? A Medline search was undertaken and all available reported literature, related to seat-belt associated breast trauma, reviewed. Results:?? A concise summary of the varied clinical and radiological presentations is given, as is their suggested management. Subsequently highlighted is the paucity of literature discussing the breast reconstruction options for a breast deformed by blunt trauma and thus, this issue is discussed using a specific case as an example. Conclusions:?? Blunt breast trauma secondary to seat-belt restraint is not only likely to become more common, but can be severe in its functional, psycho-social and aesthetic impact. This paper provides a new adjunct to the currently reported literature, especially in the area of plastic surgical reconstruction of a breast deformed by blunt trauma.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives? At present, the range of services delivered in a health system is not known. Currently there are no accepted methods for defining the scope of ambulatory care. Therefore we used data from the electronic medical record and billing system of a large non-profit multi-specialty group practice to measure the number of different diagnoses that clinicians managed as well as the number of different medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, referrals and procedures ordered. Methods? All patient encounters and clinicians in the group practice in 2008 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Data were analysed cumulatively for the practice and by specialty. Quantile regression models were used to adjust for differences in full-time equivalents (FTE) among physicians at the practice. Results? In one year for this practice, with 324?229 patients who made 3?193?917 office visits to 578 physicians and 248 other clinicians, patients presented with 5638 primary and 6411 secondary diagnoses. Overall, patient management resulted in unique orders for 9481 medications, 1182 laboratory tests, 613 referrals, 284 imaging studies and 1701 procedures. After adjusting for FTE, physicians managed a median of 249 primary diagnoses and 347 secondary diagnoses. They ordered a median of 278 medications, 128 laboratory tests, 51 referrals, 29 imaging studies and 39 procedures. Conclusion? Physicians routinely manage a substantial variety of diagnoses, medications, and other tests and procedures. Quality improvement and health services researchers have generally focused on individual services but also must consider the wide variety and range of services delivered.

AB  - Abstract There has been a recent call for longitudinal imaging studies to better characterize the time course of physiological recovery following sport-related concussion (SRC) and its relationship with clinical recovery. To address this, we evaluated changes to resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the whole-brain network following SRC and explored associations between rs-FC and measures of clinical outcome. High school and collegiate football athletes were enrolled during preseason. Athletes that suffered SRC (N =?62) were assessed across the acute (within 48?hr) and sub-acute (days 8, 15, and 45) phases. Matched football athletes without concussion served as controls (N =?60) and participated in similar visits. Multi-band resting-state fMRI was used to assess whole-brain rs-FC at each visit using network-based statistic and average nodal strength from regions of interest defined using a common whole-brain parcellation. Concussed athletes had elevated symptoms, psychological distress, and oculomotor, balance, and memory deficits at 48?hr postconcussion relative to controls, with diminished yet significant elevations in symptoms and psychological distress at 8?days. Both rs-FC analyses showed that concussed athletes had a global increase in connectivity at 8?days postconcussion relative to controls, with no differences at the 48-hr, 15-day, or 45-day visits. Further analysis revealed the group effect at the 8-day visit was driven by the large minority of concussed athletes still symptomatic at their visit; asymptomatic concussed athletes did not differ from controls. Findings from this large-scale, prospective study suggest whole-brain rs-FC alterations following SRC are delayed in onset but associated with the presence of self-reported symptoms.
