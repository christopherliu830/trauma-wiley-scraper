AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often referred to as the great masquerader, and remains a diagnostic challenge in daily practice due to its mostly unspecific clinical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms are needed to assist clinical assessment and optimise the use of investigations, especially under emergency conditions. Nuclear medicine ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy has long been the imaging mainstay for the diagnosis of PE. Venous thromboembolism is not directly visualised but, rather, its effects on perfusion and ventilation. This necessitates the need for probability criteria, categorised as high, intermediate, low or very low probability, and normal. Spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) emerged in the 1990s as a new diagnostic technique. CTPA has become the gold standard for the radiological assessment of a clinically suspected PE in daily practice. Special attention should be given to the clinical impact of incidental and subsegmental emboli.

AB  - Summary A paste formulation of the H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole was evaluated in Thoroughbred foals and yearlings for its safety and acceptability. Twenty foals age 11?16 weeks and 20 yearling horses age 15?17 months were included and gastroscopic examinations performed 1?3 days before and at the end of each trial. Lesions were scored on a scale of 0 to 3 and animals allocated based on endoscopic lesion score and sex, with 4 animals in each of 5 replicates. Dosages of 4 mg omeprazole/kg bwt or sham treatment were administered once daily for 28 days, from a syringe graduated in 50 lb (22.68 kg) increments, the amount of paste administered being rounded up to the nearest corresponding weight in pounds. Acceptability of the paste or sham treatment was assessed and recorded by the individual administering the treatment on the basis of the tolerance or resistance to insertion of the syringe into the mouth, administration of the paste and if the paste was swallowed or actively expelled by the animal. Safety was determined on the basis of daily observation recordings and physical examination findings during and at the conclusion of the trial. Treatment was judged to have been accepted for all 420 doses of omeprazole paste and all 140 sham doses given to foals during the trial and for 418/420 doses of paste and all 140 sham doses given to yearlings. Two doses of paste were entirely rejected by yearlings. On the initial endoscopic examination, lesions were observed in the gastric squamous epithelial mucosa in 4 foals and 3 yearlings, and single small, superficial erosions were seen in the gastric glandular mucosa of 2 foals. On the second examination there were small, superficial erosions in the squamous mucosa in 3 foals and 2 yearlings, multi-focal superficial erosions in 1 foal and 1 yearling, and 1 foal had large areas of erosion extending from the margo plicatus toward the dorsal fundus. No lesions in the glandular mucosa were seen in foals or yearlings. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in lesion scores between the beginning and the end of the trials in the omeprazole-treated or sham-treated groups of foals or yearlings. A paste formulation of omeprazole, administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg bwt once daily for 28 days, was determined to be highly acceptable to the foals and yearlings we studied, and no adverse effects attributable to the medication were noted

AB  - The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to generate clinically acceptable prostate permanent seed implant plans using two seed types which are identical except for their activity. The IPSA inverse planning algorithms were modified to include multiple dose matrices for the calculation of dose from different sources, and a selection algorithm was implemented to allow for the swapping of source type at any given source position. Five previously treated patients with a range of prostate volumes from were re-optimized under two hybrid scenarios: (1) using 0.32 and , and (2) using 0.64 and . Isodose lines were generated and dosimetric indices, , , , , , , and were calculated. The algorithm allows for the generation of single-isotope, multi-activity hybrid brachytherapy plans. By dealing with only one radionuclide, but of different activity, the biology is unchanged from a standard plan. All were within 2.3 percentage points for every plan and always above the clinically desirable 95%. All were identically zero, and is always below the clinically acceptable value of . Clinical optimization times for the hybrid plans are still under one minute, for most cases. It is possible to generate clinically advantageous brachytherapy plans (i.e. obtain the same quality dose distribution as a standard single-activity plan) while incorporating leftover seeds from a previous patient treatment. This method will allow a clinic to continue to provide excellent patient care, but at a reduced cost. Multi-activity hybrid plans were equal in quality (as measured by the standard dosimetric indices) to plans with seeds of a single activity. Despite the expanded search space, optimization times for these studies were still under two minutes on a modern day laptop and can be reduced to below one minute in a clinical setting. With the typical cost of a set of PPI seeds on the order of thousands of dollars, it is possible to reduce the cost of brachytherapy treatments by allowing for easier use of seeds left over from a previous patient or unused due to a cancelled treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background The application of human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) and transparent machine learning (ML), to integrated Gross anatomy models, complemented with medical imaging data of cadavers and novel audio tissue characterization methods, makes available a route to autonomous robot-delivered surgeries and pathological characterisation. It can provide the capability of objective autopsy with reliable operations that improve both accuracy (robot) and tissue interpretation (AI), thus preventing the wrong diagnosis from being made. Methods We reviewed technological advances and state-of-the-art developments documented by undertaking a literature search on autonomous robotics for surgery and autopsy, tracing agents, explainable AI, ML black box solutions, algorithmic transparent/opaque processes, as well as AI legal and ethical issues such as data biases (e.g. gender/racial/social bias) and relevant traditional, religious or sociocultural aspects. For the use of autonomous robotics in either surgery or autopsy, our approach is to discuss the ?challenges and knowledge gaps? followed by our proposed ?hypotheses and recommendations?. Conclusion The integration of explainable AI and ML, and novel tissue characterization sensorics to tele-operated robotic procedures with medical imaged cadavers, provides robotic guidance and refines tissue classifications at a molecular level. This can lead to the development of software that is not restricted to just automating ?autopsies? but, rather, could hold potential for ?surgeries? at large. The current R&D on autonomous surgical robotics is typically presented by comparing the skills of ?humans? versus ?robots?. In contrast, our assertion is that autonomous robotics and explainable AI can support healthcare values complementing and augmenting human capacities ? NOT replacing them. Autonomous robots, trained to perform surgery or autopsy, based on their trained algorithms, can deliver practical positive solutions in medicine. This potential improves when advanced imaging solutions help provide GPS-like guidance and improve tissue interpretation. In the short term, we are confident that autonomous robotic ?autopsy? coupled to ML, with a human-in-the-loop, could present a fundamental change in forensic analysis of cadavers. Furthermore, autonomous procedures, applied to medical imaging-guided robotic autopsies, can furnish powerful support to pathological and technological developments that are translatable to broader surgical procedures (e.g. enhancing motor control in a standard tele-operated surgical system and improving imaging based GPS-like navigation of robotic tools). In addition to being necessary for complex access and guidance, these reliable operations are independent to the human factors that encompass fatigue, and risk of pathological exposure, such as contagious vectors and psychopathy.

AB  - Objectives To present a novel technique for loading of the canine elbow joint and to quantify changes in congruency with increasing load using computed tomography. Materials and Methods Five pairs of thoracic limbs were mounted at a mid stance angle in a custom made jig. Elbow joints were loaded to 0, 33, 66 and 100% of total individual cadaver bodyweight. At each load computed tomography of the elbow was performed. Joint space measurement was performed on sagittal plane central, lateral and medial compartment images at humero-radial (R1,?R2,?R3), humero-ulnar (U1, U2) and radio-ulnar loci. The effect of loading on joint spaces was assessed (P<0·05). Results With increasing load; for central an increase in R1 and radio-ulnar distance and decreased R3?occurred; for medial R1 increased; and for lateral R1 and radio-ulnar distance increased. The largest increases were seen in the lateral compartment. Clinical Significance Significant changes in humero-radio-ulnar congruency occurred suggesting pronation of the radius with respect to the ulna was induced during loading. This movement may influence the load experienced by the medial coronoid process and could play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of medial coronoid process disease.

AB  - Radio-activated gene therapy has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer; however, expression of therapeutic gene in peritumoral tissues will result in unacceptable toxicity to normal cells. To restrict gene expression in targeted tumor mass, we used hypoxia and radiation tolerance features of tumor cells to develop a synthetic AND gate genetic circuit through connecting radiation sensitivity promoter cArG6, heat shock response elements SNF1, HSF1 and HSE4 with retroviral vector plxsn. Their construction and dynamic activity process were identified through downstream enhanced green fluorescent protein and wtp53 expression in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and in a nude mice model. The result showed that AND gate genetic circuit could be activated by lower required radiation dose (6 Gy) and after activated, AND gate could induce significant apoptosis effects and growth inhibition of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The radiation- and hypoxia-activated AND gate genetic circuit, which could lead to more powerful target tumoricidal activity represented a promising strategy for both targeted and effective gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma and low dose activation character of the AND gate genetic circuit implied that this model could be further exploited to decrease side-effects of clinical radiation therapy.

AB  - Summary Detomidine hydrochloride, butorphanol tartrate, flunixin meglumine and xylazine hydrochloride were evaluated in a blind multi-centre clinical trial in 152 horses with abdominal pain. The drugs were administered as follows: detomidine 20 or 40 ?g/kg bodyweight (bwt); butorphanol 0.1 mg/kg bwt; flunixin meglumine 1.0 mg/kg bwt; xylazine hydrochloride 0.5 mg/kg bwt. Each centre compared responses to the two doses of detomidine with those to one of the other analgesics. The drugs were administered intravenously (iv) after clinical assessment of the degree of sweating, kicking, pawing, head and body movement, attitude, lip curling, stretching to urinate, pulse rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature. Similar assessments were repeated at 15 min intervals for at least 1 h. The investigators ranked the response to treatment from ?not satisfactory? to ?highly satisfactory?. Significant differences in sweating, kicking, pawing, head and body movement, attitude, pulse rate and respiratory rate were noted between the horses receiving butorphanol and either dose of detomidine. The investigators' subjective evaluation of the analgesic and sedative effects of either dose of detomidine were significantly better than for butorphanol. Analgesia was rated as highly satisfactory or satisfactory in 93.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent of the horses receiving 40 ?g/kg bwt of detomidine, 73.3 per cent and 26.7 per cent of the horses receiving 20 ?g/kg bwt of detomidine, and none of the horses receiving butorphanol. There were no differences in the incidence of side effects with the two compounds. Significant differences were noted in kicking, pawing, head and body movement and attitude between the horses receiving flunixin meglumine and either dose of detomidine. Flunixin meglumine provided significantly less analgesia than either dose of detomidine. Analgesia was rated as highly satisfactory or satisfactory in 73.7 per cent and 21.0 per cent of the horses receiving 40 ?g/kg bwt of detomidine, 42.9 per cent and 21.4 per cent of the horses receiving 20 ?g/kg bwt of detomidine, and 6.3 per cent and 37.5 per cent of the horses receiving xylazine. Sedation was considered to be at least satisfactory in 84.2 per cent of the horses receiving 40 ?g/kg of detomidine, 71.5 per cent of the horses receiving 20 ?g/kg of detomidine and 53.3 per cent of the horses receiving xylazine.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Survival rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) approach 95%. At the same time, there is growing concern that chemotherapy causes alterations in brain development and cognitive abilities. We performed MRI measurements of white and gray matter volume to explore how variation in brain structure may be related to cognitive abilities in ALL survivors and healthy controls. Methods The sample included 24 male ALL survivors who had completed contemporary treatment 3?11 years prior, and 21 age- and sex-matched controls. Participants were between 8 and 18 years old. Working memory and motor response inhibition were measured with the N-Back and Stop Signal Tasks (SST), respectively. Participants underwent 3T structural MRI to assess white and gray matter volumes overall, lobe-wise, and in cortical and atlas-identified subcortical structures. Mental health was assessed with the Child Behavioral Checklist. Results ALL survivors performed more poorly on measures of working memory and response inhibition than controls. Frontal and parietal white matter, temporal and occipital gray matter volume, and volumes of subcortical white and gray matter structures were significantly reduced in ALL survivors compared with controls. Significant structure-function correlations were observed between working memory performance and volume of the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, and corpus callosum. Response inhibition was correlated with frontal white matter volume. No differences were found in psychopathology. Conclusions Compared with controls, a reduction in volume across brain regions and tissue types, was detectable in ALL survivors years after completion of therapy. These structural alterations were correlated with neurocognitive performance, particularly in working memory. Confirming these observations in a larger, more representative sample of the population is necessary. Additionally, establishing the time course of these changes?and the treatment, genetic, and environmental factors that influence them?may provide opportunities to identify at-risk patients, inform the design of treatment modifications, and minimize adverse cognitive outcomes.

Method A total of 29 participants were randomized to either to EMDR + SC (n = 15) or SC (n = 14). Participants completed measures on traumatic stress (PCL-C) and comorbid distress at baseline, 1 week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results In the EMDR + SC group, 9 (60%) participants at post-treatment and 7 (47%) participants at 3-month follow-up were diagnosis free. In SC, 4 (27%) at post-treatment and follow-up were diagnosis free. At post-treatment, three participants (20%) dropped out from the EMDR + SC group, and 1 (7%) dropped out from the SC group. Conclusions It is feasible, acceptable and potentially effective to deliver EMDR in this population group.

AB  - Abstract Transplantation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PCs) is a promising treatment for a variety of neuropathological conditions. Although previous reports have indicated the effectiveness of hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation into the injured spinal cord of rodents and nonhuman primates, long-term observation of hiPSC-NS/PCs post-transplantation suggested some ?unsafe? differentiation-resistant properties, resulting in disordered overgrowth. These findings suggest that, even if ?safe? NS/PCs are transplanted into the human central nervous system (CNS), the dynamics of cellular differentiation of stem cells should be noninvasively tracked to ensure safety. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides molecular-functional information and helps to detect specific disease conditions. The current study was conducted to visualize Nestin (an NS/PC marker)-positive undifferentiated neural cells in the CNS of immune-deficient (nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune-deficient) mice after hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation with PET, using 18?kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligands as labels. TSPO was recently found to be expressed in rodent NS/PCs, and its expression decreased with the progression of neuronal differentiation. We hypothesized that TSPO would also be present in hiPSC-NS/PCs and expressed strongly in residual immature neural cells after transplantation. The results showed high levels of TSPO expression in immature hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells, and decreased TSPO expression as neural differentiation progressed in vitro. Furthermore, PET with [18F] FEDAC (a TSPO radioligand) was able to visualize the remnant undifferentiated hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells consisting of TSPO and Nestin+ cells in vivo. These findings suggest that PET with [18F] FEDAC could play a key role in the safe clinical application of CNS repair in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores what is at stake in the intersection between film style and franchise economics in this dominant mode of twenty-first-century action filmmaking, focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on the superhero film, the most successful of this strand of action-fantasy blockbusters. Spectacular digital visual effects sequences are ?increasingly part of the sales pitch? that promotes action blockbusters. Digital imaging technologies, with their capacity for ?micro-level image manipulation?, promise filmmakers more ?seamless? depictions of super-powered, flying bodies. Digital affordances do not result in radical departures from traditional cinematic world building but instead expand the scale and detail of spaces of action and characters' trajectories through them. Spatial and temporal extension have a longstanding association with the articulation of power in the action film, yet a common criticism of the contemporary action sequence is that its extension of space and time is excessive in ways that work against spectatorial pleasure.

AB  - An 11-month-old Border collie presented collapsed and continued to deteriorate rapidly despite supportive treatment. The dog had a history of failure to thrive and recurring respiratory infection. Laboratory abnormalities included neutrophilic leucocytosis, Heinz body anaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria and hypocobalaminaemia. Post-mortem examination revealed multi-focal necrosis within the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, meninges and cerebral cortex. Fungal hyphae in lesions were identified as Scedosporium prolificans following culture. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that the dog carried the CUBN:c.8392delC mutation in a homozygous state, verifying hereditary cobalamin deficiency (a.k.a. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Cobalamin deficiency may have been a predisposing factor for the development of systemic fungal infection in this dog.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Objective To describe the anatomy of congenital portosystemic shunts emanating from the left gastric vein in dogs and cats. Methods A retrospective review of a consecutive series of dogs and cats managed for congenital portosystemic shunts. Results Forty-six dogs and 27 cats met the inclusion criteria of a congenital portosystemic shunt emanating from the left gastric vein. Of the 46 dogs, 28 (61%) had a shunt that entered the left phrenic vein, 10 (22%) had a shunt that entered the post hepatic caudal vena cava and in 8 (17%) the shunt entered the azygos vein. Of the 27 cats, 19 (70%) had a shunt that entered the left phrenic vein and 8 (30%) had a shunt that entered the post hepatic caudal vena cava. Clinical Significance The systemic vein into which the shunt entered was consistent showing three common presentations: left gastro-phrenic, left gastro-caval and left gastro-azygos. This information may help with surgical planning in cases undergoing shunt closure surgery.
