AB  - Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are defined as circumscribed malformations of cortical development. They result from an impairment of neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation. In the diagnosis of focal epilepsy FCD prevalence ranges between 5% and 25%, depending on patient collective and imaging techniques. Several ?cryptogenic? epilepsies may be caused by FCD but have not been diagnosed because of the lack of high-quality magnetic resonance imaging assessment. Retrospective analysis of patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery can be biased because of the fact that they represent a mere subset of potential FCD diagnoses. Epilepsy typically manifests within the first years of life, but has been documented up to the age of 60?years. Cognitive impairment commonly accompanies early onset. Epilepsy is often refractory to antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Clinical observations and pathophysiological findings illustrate intrinsic epileptogenicity. Upregulation of drug transporter proteins has been found in FCD tissue. There is no specific drug treatment in FCD, as any AED used in focal epilepsy could prove effective. A sequential AED therapy should be designed individually and take side effects as well as developmental progresses into consideration. Fifty to sixty-five percent of FCD patients are rendered seizure-free after surgery. Presurgical evaluation should be initiated after two unsuccessful AED trials. Both risks and potential benefits regarding seizure control and developmental impairment need to be considered on an individual basis when deciding between surgical intervention and conservative treatment. Current knowledge on epilepsy course and psychomotor development in FCD is limited in the absence of qualified long-term studies combining imaging with cognitive evaluation.

AB  - Objective To describe the anatomy of congenital portosystemic shunts emanating from the left gastric vein in dogs and cats. Methods A retrospective review of a consecutive series of dogs and cats managed for congenital portosystemic shunts. Results Forty-six dogs and 27 cats met the inclusion criteria of a congenital portosystemic shunt emanating from the left gastric vein. Of the 46 dogs, 28 (61%) had a shunt that entered the left phrenic vein, 10 (22%) had a shunt that entered the post hepatic caudal vena cava and in 8 (17%) the shunt entered the azygos vein. Of the 27 cats, 19 (70%) had a shunt that entered the left phrenic vein and 8 (30%) had a shunt that entered the post hepatic caudal vena cava. Clinical Significance The systemic vein into which the shunt entered was consistent showing three common presentations: left gastro-phrenic, left gastro-caval and left gastro-azygos. This information may help with surgical planning in cases undergoing shunt closure surgery.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? Fibrous dysplasia is a benign fibro-osseous tumour of bones commonly involving the craniofacial region. Computed tomography (CT) imaging study of the disease is useful for evaluation and treatment planning. However, few studies have evaluated patient series in an African setting. Material and methods:? A total of 14 patients with complete medical records and CT images were included in this study. All patients were non-syndromic fibrous dysplasia involving only the craniofacial region. None had skin pigmentation or other evidence of endocrine problems. Data analysis was essentially on clinical and CT appearances of the lesions. Results:? Facial swelling was the chief complaint in 79% of patients. Two patients were incidentally discovered after cranial CT scanning for head injury and stroke. The average number of bones involved was 5.4 per patient. Involvement of more than one craniofacial bone occurred in 78% of patients. The maxilla was involved in eight patients (57.14%), the ethmoidal, orbital and frontal bones were the most commonly jointly involved bones (64.3%). CT images appeared sclerotic or homogenous in 36%, ground glass or heterogeneous in 71% and cystic in 7%. Conclusion:? CT features of craniofacial dysplasia in patients of African descent are similar to that seen in other racial groups. Our findings further suggest that craniofacial fibrous dysplasia can hardly be described as monostotic.

AB  - ABSTRACT Skin loss can be caused by accident, burn, trauma, chronic wounds, and diseases, which is severely aggravated by multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Soft hybrids based on biopolymers combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have potential applications as wound dressing supports and skin tissue repair. Thus, our study focused on the design, green synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC?AgNP) nanocomposites for producing hydrogel membranes, with tunable physicochemical properties, cytocompatibility, and biocidal activity for potential application as wound dressing and skin repair. These nanocomposites were prepared using CMC with two degrees of carboxymethylation, distinct concentrations of citric acid (CA) crosslinker, and AgNPs by in situ chemical reduction, forming hybrid membranes by the solvent casting method. The results demonstrated that superabsorbent hydrogels were produced with swelling and degradation behaviors dependent on the concentration of CA crosslinker, degree of carboxymethylation of CMC, and content of AgNP in the matrices. Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis evidenced that the CMC functional groups (e.g., ?COOH and ?OH) were directly involved in the chemical reactions for the formation of AgNPs and hydrogel crosslinking pathway. These nanocomposites were cytocompatible using in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assay with of human embryonic kidney cells. Conclusively, the CMC?AgNP nanohybrids demonstrated to be simultaneously non-toxic combined with highly effective antibacterial activity against gram-positive multi-resistant wound/skin pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus) and moderate effect towards gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Radiosurgery is defined as the delivery of high doses of ionising radiation, in mono- or hypo- fractionated treatments, to destroy tumours or focal areas of pathology. The clinical requirements of designing a radiosurgical treatment system include providing: a) a highly precise beam delivery to targets located throughout the body, b) a highly conformal dose distribution, c) the ability to irradiate both small and/or large complex-shaped lesions while minimising the dose to adjacent radiosensitive tissues and d) the ability to interactively track lesion motion due to normal patient motion. To accomplish this, the CyberKnife? radiosurgery system has pioneered in this area by taking advantage of the inherent geometrical targeting precision of a commercial arm-based robotic system carrying a compact X-band linear accelerator and integrated with X-ray imaging and visualisation feedback systems. The arm-mounted linear accelerator, equipped with patient specific anatomical models, registered to the patient in real-time with image guidance, dynamically and safely delivers conformal and homogeneous radiation for therapeutic benefit. This paper details the components of the CyberKnife system and their integration in the clinical workflow of radiosurgery. Copyright ? 2005 Robotic Publications, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract:? Tragically as many as 50% of pheochromocytomas are discovered at autopsy, mainly because the diagnosis of this neuroendocrine tumor was not considered. Missing the diagnosis almost invariably results in devastating cardiovascular complications or death. Clinicians must always think of pheochromocytoma whenever evaluating a patient with sustained or paroxysmal hypertension or any manifestations suggesting hypercatecholaminemia. Very rarely, familial pheochromocytomas may cause no hypertension, symptoms, or signs. But biochemical testing can always establish the presence or absence of a pheochromocytoma, and localization with magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or 131I or 123I-MIBG is almost always possible.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the accuracy of linear measurements obtained from computer tomography (CT) images of staged radio-ulnar incongruence in a canine cadaver forelimb model. Study Design? CT evaluation of induced progressive radio-ulnar incongruence in canine cadaveric forelimbs. Sample Population? Eight cadaveric canine left forelimbs. Procedure? A type 2 external skeletal fixator (ESF) with linear motors was attached to the radius in 8 cadaveric left canine forelimbs. Contiguous incremental and helical CT images of the proximal radio-ulnar articulation were acquired in the transverse, sagittal and dorsal planes. The radius was shortened by 1, 2, and 4?mm increments and scanning protocols were repeated at each increment. Digital caliper and CT image analysis measured the progressive change in distance between 2 marking spheres and the epiphyseal bone surfaces of the radio-ulnar articulation. Statistical analysis of measurements from incremental and helical CT acquisitions, and direct and reformatted images were compared with inter-sphere distance using Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. Results? The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the mid-coronoid in the oblique plane had the highest correlation coefficient (r-value) at 0.908. The mid-coronoid in the dorsal plane had the second highest r-value (0.856). The coronoid incisure in the sagittal plane had an r-value of 0.826. The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the coronoid incisure in the oblique plane had the lowest r-value, 0.592. Conclusion? Measurement of radioulnar incongruence may be best performed using reformatted incremental acquisition CT in the mid-coronoid region in an oblique plane. Clinical Relevance? Use of the technique reported in this study may enable determination of the association, if any, between radioulnar incongruence and developmental diseases of the canine elbow.

AB  - Abstract Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus for hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy currently requires high resolution MRI in addition to neuroanatomic expertise for manual segmentation. Removing the need for MR images to identify the hippocampus would reduce planning complexity, the need for a treatment planning MR imaging session, potential uncertainties associated with MRI-CT image registration, and cost. Three-dimensional deep convolutional network models have the potential to automate hippocampal segmentation. In this study, we demonstrate that deep learning models, utilizing 3D convolutional neural networks, can accurately delineate the hippocampus using only high-resolution non-contrast CT images. Purpose To investigate the inter-observer accuracy and reliability of hippocampal segmentation by experts using MRI -fusion and an automated deep learning model using CT alone. Methods Retrospectively, 390 Gamma Knife patients with high resolution CT and MR images were collected. Following the RTOG 0933 guidelines, images were rigidly fused, and a neuroanatomic expert contoured the hippocampus on the MR, then transferred the contours to CT. Using a calculated cranial centroid, the image volumes were cropped to 200 x 200 x 35 voxels, which were used to train four models, including our proposed Attention-Gated 3D ResNet (AG-3D ResNet). These models were then compared with results from a nested 10-fold validation. From the predicted test set volumes, we calculated the 100% Hausdorff distance (HD). Acceptability was assessed using the RTOG 0933 protocol criteria, contours were considered passing with HD ≤ 7 mm. Results The bilateral hippocampus passing rate across all 90 models trained in the nested cross-fold validation was 80.2% for AG-3D ResNet, which performs with a comparable pass rate (p = 0.3345) to physicians during centralized review for the RTOG 0933 Phase II clinical trial. Conclusion Our proposed AG-3D ResNet?s segmentation of the hippocampus from non-contrast CT images alone are comparable to those obtained by participating physicians from the RTOG 0933 Phase II clinical trial.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Background and Objectives This study challenges the currently accepted treatment parameters of waiting 1 year following burn injury to treat the resultant scarring. It assesses the impact of treating burn and trauma wounds at less than 3 months of injury on scar formation, providing a new temporal paradigm to patients in the prevention and minimization of scar formation. Study Design/Materials and Methods This randomized clinical trial included 19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute burn injuries less than 3 months from injury. The treatment areas underwent three fractional ablative CO2 laser treatments at 8-week intervals. The primary outcomes were improvement in the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and photography. Secondary outcomes were optical coherence tomography (OCT), treatment time, immediate post-treatment response, and histology. Results Upon blinded evaluation, 100% of treatment areas were correctly identified when compared with control. MSS scores before and after treatment were totaled with an averaged sum of 13.33 per scar at baseline to 8.39 after treatment, a 63% average improvement versus control (P?<?0.001). Histology and OCT demonstrated a re-organization of the underlying skin structure. The average treatment time was 18?minutes. Immediate post-treatment responses were limited to mild-to-moderate erythema. Conclusions Early intervention with ablative fractional laser on acute traumatic wounds resulted in significant decrease of scar formation compared with untreated areas on the same wounds, providing an impactful new time course to treat severe burn and trauma injuries.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Urethral strictures, bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and urorectal fistulation are three well-recognised complications of the treatment of prostate cancer, whether by surgery or non-surgical treatment. Because these are relatively rare problems the treatment is uncertain. There is a heavy reliance on endoscopic or instrumental management of urethral strictures and of bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and there is little discrimination in any of these conditions between those that are the result of surgery and those that are the result of radiotherapy and other treatment methods using external energy sources. This review aims to clarify out current understanding of these three clinical problems and draws attention to the role of reconstructive surgery, particularly when dealing with bladder neck contractures, prostatic urethral stenoses and urorectal fistula. This also shows that the nature of the problem, the recovery time after treatment and the degree of functional recovery is radically different in the surgical as against the non-surgical group, to a degree that the authors believe is not sufficiently stressed when patients are counselled and consented before their primary treatment. ?? To review the less common and not widely discussed, but much more serious complications of prostate cancer treatment of: urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture and urorectal fistula. ?? The treatment options for patients with organ-confirmed prostate cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy; with each method or combination of methods having associated complications. ?? Complications resulting from RP are relatively easy to manage, with rapid recovery and return to normal activities, and usually a return to normal bodily functions. ?? However, after non-surgical treatments, i.e. BT, EBRT, HIFU and cryotherapy, these same problems are more difficult to treat with a much slower return to a much lower level of function. ?? When counselling patients about the primary treatment of prostate cancer they should be advised that although the same type of complication may occur after surgical or non-surgical treatment, the scope and scale of that complication, the ease with which it is treated and the degree of restoration of normality after treatment, is altogether in favour of surgery in those for whom surgery is appropriate and who are fit for surgery.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Infant skull deformation is analyzed using the distribution of head normal vector directions computed from a 3D image. Severity of flatness and asymmetry are quantified by functionals of the kernel estimate of the normal vector direction density. Using image data from 99 infants and clinical deformation ratings made by experts, our approach is compared with some recently suggested methods. The results show that the proposed method performs competitively. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities (CEPEF-1) is an observational multi-institutional prospective study of recovery outcome at 7 days post operatively, as called for by Steffey (1991). Data from 6,255 general anaesthetics (February 91-March 93) were submitted confidentially by 62 clinics. The outcomes of 333 cases which were subjected to euthanasia and which were not classified ?alive? or ?died? at 7 days, were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 5922 cases were analysed to identify risk ratios (RR) between survivors and nonsurvivors for a variety of factors. These preliminary results indicate an overall death rate, for equine patients dying or being subjected to euthanasia within 7 days of a general anaesthetic because of perioperative complications, of 102/6255 (1.6%). This mortality rate decreased to 46/5220 (0.9%) when all colic surgery and delivery of foals under general anaesthesia were excluded. There was an increased risk for mares in the last trimester of pregnancy (RR=6.4). Patients undergoing emergency abdominal procedures (colic patients and pregnant mares undergoing controlled or caesarean section delivery of foals) under general anaesthesia were at increased risk (RR=12.9) compared to ear, nose and throat surgery. Within orthopaedic surgery, patients requiring internal fixation were at increased risk (RR=3.2) compared to those undergoing miscellaneous orthopaedic surgery. There was no difference in risk between breeds. Patients not placed in dorsal recumbency were at reduced risk (RR=0.3-0.5) compared to those which were in dorsal recumbency. Lack of a sedative premedication and use of xylazine were associated with a RR of 6.2 and 2.1 respectively, compared to patients given only detomidine for sedative premedication. However, 90% of all induction regimes were at similar risk, except inhalation with halothane (RR=4.8) and guaiphenesin and ketamine combination (RR=4.3) compared to guaiphenesin and thiopentone combination. There was a reduction in risk for surgeries carried out in the last quarter of the year (RR=0.3), compared to surgery carried out in the first three-quarters. Patients younger than 1-week-old (RR=20.6) and between 1-week and 1-month-old (RR=4.3) and patients older than 12 years old (RR=3.1) were at increased risk, compared to patients age 2?4 years. The likelihood of death increased as the duration of anaesthesia increased beyond 61 min, with the greatest being operations lasting longer than 241 min (RR=7.6). Surgery performed outside of 0900?1700 h had increased risk, worst between 1801?2000 h (RR=9.9), compared to surgeries carried out between 0801?1300 h.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Estimate the incidence rate and provide basic descriptive epidemiologic characteristics of plunging ranulas in a multi-ethnic population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Methods The study group comprised all Counties Manukau Health (CMH, Manukau City, Auckland, New Zealand) patients presenting to the CMH Department of Otolaryngology with a diagnosis of plunging ranula from January 2001 to December 2013, as recorded in the departmental case register. Non-CMH domicile patients were excluded. South Auckland comprised the base population, as serviced by CMH. The 2006 New Zealand census data was used for population demographics. Results A total of 134 cases of plunging ranula were identified. The overall annual crude incidence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The gender specific incidence rate for males was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5. 3.9) and for females was 2.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6). The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rate was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.0). The age-adjusted incidence was highest among Maori (6.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.9, 8.4), followed by Pacific Island (4.4 per 100,000, 95% CI 3.2, 5.6), Asian (0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.2, 1.2), and European population (0.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8). Conclusion We have quantified for the first time the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for plunging ranula by gender and ethnicity. The results show a likely underlying genetic predisposition for this condition, possibly with a superimposed environmental acquired factor relating to external, minor blunt trauma to the neck.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Summary Hordenine is an alkaloid occurring naturally in grains, sprouting barley, and certain grasses. It is occasionally found in post race urine samples, and therefore we investigated its pharmacological actions in the horse. Hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bodyweight [bwt]) was administered by rapid intravenous (iv) injection to 10 horses. Typically, dosed horses showed a flehmen response and defecated within 60 secs. All horses showed substantial respiratory distress. Respiratory rates increased about 250 per cent and heart rates were approximately double that of resting values. All animals broke out in a sweat shortly after iv injection, but basal body temperature was not affected. These effects were transient, and the animals appeared normal within 30 mins of dosing. Treated horses were tested in a variable interval responding apparatus 30 mins after dosing and no residual stimulation or depressant effects of hordenine were apparent. Animals dosed orally with 2.0 mg/kg bwt of hordenine showed no changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, basal body temperature or behaviour. After iv injection of hordenine, (2.0 mg/kg bwt) plasma reached a maximum value of about 1.0 ?g/ml, and declined thereafter in a biexponential fashion. Kinetics of plasma concentration satisfied the concept of a two compartment open system, with an α-phase half-life of about 3 mins, and a ß-phase half-life of about 35 mins. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 400 ?g/ml, and then declined exponentially to background levels by 24 h after dosing. Oral administration of hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bwt) showed peak plasma levels of about 0.15 ?g/ml 1 h after dosing, followed by a slow multi-exponential decline in blood levels of the drug. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 200 ?g/ml, remained at this level for about 8 h, and then declined to background levels. Plasma levels of hordenine were reflected by a kinetic model which assumed very slow absorption of hordenine from the gastrointestinal tract and no effect on behaviour, heart rate or respiratory rate were noted after oral administration. Because of the low plasma levels, it would appear to be particularly difficult to obtain a pharmacological effect of hordenine after oral administration.
