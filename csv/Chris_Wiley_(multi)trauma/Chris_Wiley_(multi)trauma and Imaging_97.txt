AB  - Background The objective of this work was to explore the utility of axial computed tomography (CT) imaging to objectively define a narrow internal nasal valve, and compare those findings with clinical examination and patient complaint. Methods Retrospective review from a single facial plastic surgery center. We reviewed 40 consecutive patients evaluated for either sinusitis or nasal airway obstruction for which a CT scan was obtained at a single radiology institution. Thirty-six complete office records were examined for the presence of clinical internal valve narrowing and complaints of nasal obstruction. In total, 72 internal nasal valves were analyzed using axial plane CT and measurements were compared to clinical findings and presence of airway obstruction. Results Measured valve areas for clinically normal internal nasal valves averaged 0.47 cm2 vs 0.28 cm2 for clinically narrow valves, a decrease of 40.4%. In unobstructed nasal airways the valve area averaged 0.51 cm2 vs 0.38 cm2 in obstructed airways, a difference of 25.5%. A radiographically measured valve area of <0.30 cm2 suggests clinical narrowing with a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 88.9%, positive predictive value of 62.5%, and negative predictive value of 92.3%. Conclusion Using standard axial CT imaging we describe an objective method of radiographically evaluating the nasal valve, demonstrating strong correlation with physical examination and patient complaint. Additionally, radiographic valve areas can be used to screen for clinically narrow nasal valves with good sensitivity and specificity, providing a novel straightforward method for nasal valve assessment.

AB  - A 4-year-old female Chihuahua was presented with progressive seizures, blindness and lethargy. Neurolocalisation was consistent with a diffuse brain lesion affecting the forebrain and cerebellum. MRI demonstrated dilation of the subarachnoid space dorsolaterally surrounding the cerebrum, filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ventricular system size was normal, but mild cerebral atrophy was suspected. There was pachymeningeal contrast enhancement, but CSF analysis was unremarkable. This lesion was interpreted to be an external hydrocephalus of suspected congenital origin.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the use of dual-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography for the depiction of the features of the male genital tract, highlighting differences between entire and neutered dogs. Methods Computed tomography exams of 23 entire and 23 neutered male dogs with no history of urogenital disease were included in this retrospective study, with exams acquired pre-, 30 and 98·9 ±27·4?seconds after intravenous contrast administration. The genital structures were subjectively evaluated for visibility, contrast enhancement and enhancement pattern and differences between entire and neutered dogs were described. Objective measurements of attenuation and size of the prostatic tissue were acquired. Results The root, body and glans of the penis could be evaluated in all dogs and appeared larger in entire dogs, though objective measurements could not be reliably made because these structures are small and curved. There was contrast enhancement of the cavernous structures, most reliably in the bulb and corpus spongiosum and most frequently in entire dogs in the delayed post-contrast phase. In entire dogs, the small testicular vessels most commonly had a vermiform shape in the early post-contrast phase, and a homogeneous appearance in the delayed phase. Sternal recumbency with the coxofemoral joints extended improved visibility of the genital structures. Clinical Significance Dual-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography is useful for depiction of the structures of the male genital tract, with the early phase especially highlighting the vascular and the delayed phase the cavernous structures.

AB  - Contrary to prevailing medical belief, dementia is generally not caused by arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels. There may be, in fact, as many as 50 different causes. While the two major types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, are irreversible, perhaps 20 per cent of dementias are secondary to treatable causes, and are reversible. The most important of these is the pseudodementia of depression, which can be easily missed without a high degree of suspicion. Tips on the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and pseudodementia are discussed, as are other causes of dementia secondary to various diseases or therapy.

AB  - Abstract Stimulant abuse is disproportionately common in HIV-positive persons. Both HIV and stimulants are independently associated with deficits in reward-based decision making, but their interactive and/or additive effects are poorly understood despite their prevalent co-morbidity. Here, we examined the effects of cocaine dependence and HIV infection in 69 adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing an economic loss aversion task. We identified two neural networks that correlated with the evaluation of the favorable characteristics of the gamble (i.e. higher gains/lower losses: ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, anterior and posterior precuneus and visual cortex) versus unfavorable characteristics of the gamble (i.e. lower gains/higher losses: dorsal prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior parietal cortex, anterior insula and dorsal caudate). Behaviorally, cocaine and HIV had additive effects on loss aversion scores, with HIV-positive cocaine users being the least loss averse. Cocaine users had greater activation in brain regions that tracked the favorability of gamble characteristics (i.e. increased activation to gains, but decreased activation to losses). In contrast, HIV infection was independently associated with lesser activation in regions that tracked the unfavorability of gamble characteristics. These results suggest that cocaine is associated with an overactive reward-seeking system, while HIV is associated with an underactive cognitive control system. Together, these alterations may leave HIV-positive cocaine users particularly vulnerable to making unfavorable decisions when outcomes are uncertain.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome and owner satisfaction after planectomy for nasal planum neoplasia with cosmetic reconstruction with bilateral labial mucocutaneous rotation flaps in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Twenty-six client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records were searched for dogs that had undergone the procedure. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery, complications, requirement for revision surgery, recurrence, and survival information were recorded. Owners were contacted by telephone about their dog's quality of life after the procedure and their satisfaction with their dog's outcome. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent radical planectomy, and 1 dog underwent resection of the nasal planum. Twenty-four dogs had a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, 1 had a diagnosis of atypical adenocarcinoma, and 1 had a diagnosis of a mast cell tumor. Complications occurred in 19 (73%) dogs, with 9 dogs requiring revision surgery; 1 dog not surviving to discharge. Median survival time was 1542 days (range, 3-2010). Recurrence of the primary tumor was suspected in 2 (7.7%) dogs, both with narrow or incomplete excision. Among 11 owners interviewed, 10 were satisfied with their dog's appearance, and 8 reported they would consent to the procedure again. Conclusion Dehiscence was common after this procedure, but local tumor control and survival times were excellent. Owner satisfaction was high, although preoperative client education is vital. Clinical significance This technique should be considered as a viable option for dogs with nasal planum neoplasia given the high rate of recurrence with less aggressive treatment. Complications common following surgery, but do not persist long term and survival times were excellent.

AB  - Abstract In dogs, the stifle is a frequently injured joint. The diagnosis of stifle joint disorders is generally based on a history of lameness, physical examination, and radiography. For decades, radiography has been the most often-used medical imaging technique to diagnose stifle disorders and has been proven very useful in its clinical work-up. Computed tomography (CT) has proven to be extremely sensitive in demonstrating calcified or bony structures, and also allows demonstration of the soft tissues when the correct windowing has been applied. Under general anesthesia, the dogs are scanned in ventral recumbency with both stifles extended and scanned simultaneously. Care should be taken to position them symmetrically. With single-slice CT, the X-ray beam is angled parallel to the surface of the tibial plateau; the scan range should cover the whole joint, from the proximal pouches from the distal third of the femur to the proximal fifth of the length of the tibia.

AB  - Several very rare forms of dementia are associated with characteristic focal atrophy predominantly of the frontal and/or temporal lobes and currently lack imaging solutions to monitor disease. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is a recently developed technique providing quantitative relaxivity maps and images with various tissue contrasts out of a single sequence acquisition. This pilot study explores the utility of MRF-based T1 and T2 mapping to discover focal differences in relaxation times between patients with frontotemporal lobe degenerative dementia and healthy controls. 8 patients and 30 healthy controls underwent a 3 T MRI including an axial 2D spoiled gradient echo MRF sequence. T1 and T2 relaxation maps were generated based on an extended phase graphs algorithm-founded dictionary involving inner product pattern matching. A region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of T1 and T2 relaxation times was performed with FSL and ITK-SNAP. Depending on the brain region analyzed, T1 relaxation times were up to 10.28% longer in patients than in controls reaching significant differences in cortical gray matter (P = .047) and global white matter (P = .023) as well as in both hippocampi (P = .001 left; P = .027 right). T2 relaxation times were similarly longer in the hippocampus by up to 19.18% in patients compared with controls. The clinically most affected patient had the most control-deviant relaxation times. There was a strong correlation of T1 relaxation time in the amygdala with duration of the clinically manifest disease (Spearman Rho = .94; P = .001) and of T1 relaxation times in the left hippocampus with disease severity (Rho = .90, P = .002). In conclusion, MRF-based relaxometry is a promising and time-saving new MRI tool to study focal cerebral alterations and identify patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration. To validate the results of this pilot study, MRF is worth further exploration as a diagnostic tool in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract While current injury criteria for the automotive industry are based on bone fracture, the majority of knee injuries suffered in collisions each year do not involve fracture of bone. Instead, clinical studies of traumatic joint injury often document early pain and development of chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Previous studies suggest chronic disease can be initiated by cell death that occurs in articular cartilage during mechanical trauma to the joint. In the current investigation early necrosis of chondrocytes was investigated after blunt trauma to chondral explants. A non-ionic surfactant (P188) was explored as a potential tool for early intervention into the disease process, as this surfactant has been shown to repair damaged membranes in other cell lines. Three groups of adult bovine chondral explants were equilibrated for 48 h in culture media. Two groups were then loaded to 25 MPa in unconfined compression. Half the specimens in each group were incubated in media supplemented with 8 mg/ml P188 immediately after loading, while the other half was returned to standard media. At 1 and 24 h the percentages of live and dead cells in compressed and control groups were determined with a cell viability stain. At 1 h post-trauma, P188 incubated specimens had a significantly increased percentage of live cells in the superficial zone versus the no-P188 group. At 24 h the percentages of live cells in all three zones of the P188-treated explants were significantly greater than in the no treatment group. This study showed that P188 surfactant could help restore the integrity of cell membranes in cartilage damaged by blunt mechanical trauma. With the ability of P188 to ?save? chondrocytes from early necrotic death using in vitro chondral explants, its role in prevention of a post-traumatic osteo-arthritis in a diarthrodial joint should be further explored using in vivo animal models. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Internet use and on-line game play stimulate corticostriatal-limbic circuitry in both healthy subjects and subjects with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). We hypothesized that increased fractional anisotropy (FA) with decreased radial diffusivity (RD) would be observed in IGD subjects, compared with healthy control subjects, and that these white matter indices would be associated with clinical variables including duration of illness and executive function. We screened 181 male patients in order to recruit a large number (n?=?58) of IGD subjects without psychiatric co-morbidity as well as 26 male healthy comparison subjects. Multiple diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Tract-based spatial statistics was applied to compare group differences in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics between IGD and healthy comparison subjects. IGD subjects had increased FA values within forceps minor, right anterior thalamic radiation, right corticospinal tract, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right cingulum to hippocampus and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) as well as parallel decreases in RD value within forceps minor, right anterior thalamic radiation and IFOF relative to healthy control subjects. In addition, the duration of illness in IGD subjects was positively correlated with the FA values (integrity of white matter fibers) and negatively correlated with RD scores (diffusivity of axonal density) of whole brain white matter. In IGD subjects without psychiatric co-morbidity, our DTI results suggest that increased myelination (increased FA and decreased RD values) in right-sided frontal fiber tracts may be the result of extended game play.

AB  - Summary Local and regional anesthetic techniques are gaining widespread acceptance in the management of pain in small and large animals. They penetrate peripheral nerves and induce reversible blockade of impulse conduction in myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. The local anesthetics block the conduction of nerve impulses by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes. Administration of an incorrect dose and inadvertent intravenous administration of the local anesthetics are probably the most common causes of systemic toxicity. Local anesthetics can also be given systemically to manage perioperative pain and ileus. They are often used in combination with other classes of analgesic drugs as part of a multi-modal pain management strategy. The local anesthetics have the unique ability to produce complete blockade of peripheral nociceptive input, preventing the development of pathological pain as well as the stress response.

AB  - Abstract Background Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is recommended for post-traumatic stress disorder and emerging evidence indicates that it is effective for people with intellectual disabilities. However, acceptability from the perspectives of clients with intellectual disabilities, their therapists and other key people has not been formally evaluated. This study investigates process issues in the implementation of EMDR from perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two adults with intellectual disabilities and three clinical psychologists who had participated in EMDR as well as a key supporter (N = 6) to provide information relating to three cases. The interviews were analysed thematically either directly from the audio recording or from transcripts. Results Five themes were identified: EMDR feels very different; EMDR is a technical process; the need to work with the present; talking is important; cautious optimism. Conclusions Whilst a range of client- and therapist-related factors served as barriers to using EMDR in this small-scale study, such as preferences in working with the present and inexperienced therapists, there was cautious optimism that EMDR may be useful for ?the right person at the right time.?.

Early and late career differences were also examined. Background Nurses are routinely exposed to patient pain expression. This work context may make them vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as desensitization to patient pain or a compromise in personal well-being. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Data were collected from a convenience sample of paediatric intensive care nurses (n = 27) and allied health professionals (n = 24), from September 2014?June 2015, at a Canadian health centre. Both groups completed one demographic and three behavioural scales. Participants underwent fMRI while rating the pain of infant and adult patients in a series of video clips. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric methods. fMRI results are reported in a second paper. Results Nurses were significantly more likely to be exposed to pain at work than allied health professionals and scored significantly higher on dimensions of empathy, secondary trauma and burnout. Nurses scored their own pain and the pain of infant and adult patients, higher than allied health participants. Less experienced nurses had higher secondary trauma and burnout scores than more experienced nurses. Conclusions Paediatric intensive care work demands, such as patient pain exposure, may be associated with nurse's higher report of empathy and pain in self and others, but also with higher levels of secondary trauma and burnout, when compared with allied health professionals.

AB  - ABSTRACT The function of ligaments and tendons is to support and transmit loads applied to the musculoskeletal system. These tissues are often able to perform their function for many decades; however, connective tissue disease and injury can compromise ligament and tendon integrity. A range of protein and non-protein constituents, combined in a complex structural hierarchy from the collagen molecule to the tissue and covering nanometer to centimeter length scales, govern tissue function, and impart characteristic non-linear material behavior. This review summarizes the structure of ligaments and tendons, the roles of their constituent components for load transfer across the hierarchy of structure, and the current understanding of how damage occurs in these tissues. Disease and injury can alter the constituent make-up and structural organization of ligaments and tendons, affecting tissue function, while also providing insight to the role and interactions of individual constituents. The studies and techniques presented here have helped to understand the relationship between tissue constituents and the physical mechanisms (e.g., stretching, sliding) that govern material behavior at and between length scales. In recent years, new techniques have been developed to probe ever smaller length scales and may help to elucidate mechanisms of load transfer and damage and the molecular constituents involved in the in the earliest stages of ligament and tendon damage. A detailed understanding of load transfer and damage from the molecular to the tissue level may elucidate targets for the treatment of connective tissue diseases and inform practice to prevent and rehabilitate ligament and tendon injuries. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
