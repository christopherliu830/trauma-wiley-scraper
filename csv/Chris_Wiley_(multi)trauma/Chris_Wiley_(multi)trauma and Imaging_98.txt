AB  - Summary Background Chronic hepatitis C is considered a systemic disease because of extra-hepatic manifestations. Neuroimaging has been employed in hepatitis C virus-infected patients to find in vivo evidence of central nervous system alterations. Aims Systematic review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging research in chronic hepatitis C treatment naive patients, or patients previously treated without sustained viral response, to study structural and functional brain impact of hepatitis C. Methods Using PRISMA guidelines a database search was conducted from inception up until 1 May 2017 for peer-reviewed studies on structural or functional neuroimaging assessment of chronic hepatitis C patients without cirrhosis or encephalopathy, with control group. Meta-analyses were performed when possible. Results The final sample comprised 25 studies (magnetic resonance spectroscopy [N = 12], perfusion weighted imaging [N = 1], positron emission tomography [N = 3], single-photon emission computed tomography [N = 4], functional connectivity in resting state [N = 1], diffusion tensor imaging [N = 2] and structural magnetic resonance imaging [N = 2]). The whole sample was of 509 chronic hepatitis C patients, with an average age of 41.5 years old and mild liver disease. A meta-analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showed increased levels of choline/creatine ratio (mean difference [MD] 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.18), creatine (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.42-1.27) and glutamate plus glutamine (MD 1.67, 95% CI 0.39-2.96) in basal ganglia and increased levels of choline/creatine ratio in centrum semiovale white matter (MD 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.19) in chronic hepatitis C patients compared with healthy controls. Photon emission tomography studies meta-analyses did not find significant differences in PK11195 binding potential in cortical and subcortical regions of chronic hepatitis C patients compared with controls. Correlations were observed between various neuroimaging alterations and neurocognitive impairment, fatigue and depressive symptoms in some studies. Conclusions Patients with chronic hepatitis C exhibit cerebral metabolite alterations and structural or functional neuroimaging abnormalities, which sustain the hypothesis of hepatitis C virus involvement in brain disturbances.

AB  - Summary Background The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) forms the junction between the maxilla and mandible. Movement of the jaw and resulting masticatory forces have been extensively studied in the horse; however, less is known about the inter-relationship between this joint and oral and dental pathology. Objectives To determine the association between specific oral and dental pathologies and anatomical variations of the TMJ imaged with computed tomography (CT) in horses with asymptomatic TMJs. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods Horses (n = 201) from three practices with a complete oral examination and skull or upper cervical CT study were reviewed. Age, breed, sex, clinical presentation, oral examination findings, slice width and practice were recorded. Alterations in contour and density of the mandibular condyle, mandibular fossa and intra-articular disc were also documented. Logistic regression, corrected for clustering by practice, was used to determine whether CT anatomical variations were significantly associated with the oral examination findings. Results Horses categorised as having abnormal TMJs were older than those with normal TMJ. Horses with periodontal disease were less likely to have abnormal TMJ findings compared with horses with no oral pathology. In contrast, horses with infundibular disease were more likely to have TMJ abnormalities. Main limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, it was difficult to establish whether oral pathology preceded TMJ abnormalities. Conclusions Despite examining over 200 horses of varying ages, the biological significance of the observed associations between oral, or dental disease and anatomically appreciable temporomandibular joint disorders remains uncertain.

AB  - Abstract Even though deficits in olfactory function affect a considerable part of the population, the neuronal basis of olfactory deficits remains scarcely investigated. To achieve a better understanding of how smell loss affects neural activation patterns and functional networks, we set out to investigate patients with olfactory dysfunction using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and olfactory stimulation. We used patients? scores on a standardized olfactory test as continuous measure of olfactory function. 48 patients (mean olfactory threshold discrimination identification (TDI) score?=?16.33, SD?=?6.4, range 6 - 28.5) were investigated. Overall, patients showed piriform cortex activation during odor stimulation compared to pure sniffing. Group independent component analysis indicated that the recruitment of three networks during odor stimulation was correlated with olfactory function: a sensory processing network (including regions such as insula, thalamus and piriform cortex), a cerebellar network and an occipital network. Interestingly, recruitment of these networks during pure sniffing was related to olfactory function as well. Our results support previous findings that sniffing alone can activate olfactory regions. Extending this, we found that the severity of olfactory deficits is related to the extent to which neural networks are recruited both during olfactory stimulation and pure sniffing. This indicates that olfactory deficits are not only reflected in changes in specific olfactory areas but also in the recruitment of occipital and cerebellar networks. These findings pave the way for future investigations on whether characteristics of these networks might be of use for the prediction of disease prognosis or of treatment success.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Zusammenfassung: Bald nach der Entdeckung der Röntgenstrahlen und deren Nutzung etablierte sich die Strahlentherapie als Standardbehandlung, wobei die Indikationskriterien im Wandel der Zeit stark wechselten. Mit der Differenzierung der strahlentherapeutischen Tätigkeit wurde 1994 in Österreich der Fachbereich Radiologie getrennt, nämlich in diagnostische Radiologie und das klinische Sonderfach Strahlentherapie-Radioonkologie als therapeutischer Fachbereich. ?Im Rahmen der interdisziplinären Tumorbehandlung kommt der Radiotherapie im kurativen und palliativen Therapiekonzept eine besondere Rolle zu. Die Integration moderner bildgebender Verfahren wie Ultraschall, Computertomographie, Magnetresonanz und Positronenemissionstomographie ermöglicht es, individuelle Zielvolumina zu definieren und die topographische Beziehung zu Risikoorganen zu berücksichtigen. Die wichtigste Aufgabe der Strahlentherapie ist die homogene Bestrahlung eines festgelegten Zielvolumens, bestehend aus Tumorvolumen und einem Sicherheitssaum. Die dreidimensionale Abgrenzung des Tumors und der Risikoorgane ermöglichen das Erstellen eines individuellen Bestrahlungsplanes. Durch die Abdeckung gesunder Gewebsbezirke mittels Bleiabschirmung bzw. Multi-Leaf-Kollimatoren kann eine angepaßte Dosisverteilung (Strahlendosis im Tumor deutlich höher als im Normalgewebe) im Zielvolumen erreicht werden. Mit der Erstellung von Dosis-Volumen-Histogrammen wird die Belastung bzw. das betroffene Volumen von einzelnen Risikoorganen quantitativ ermittelt. Die konsequente Anwendung der 3D-geplanten Konformationsbestrahlung erhöht zwar den Arbeitsaufwand für die Planung der Bestrahlung wie auch den Arbeitsaufwand der Durchführung der Bestrahlung erheblich, ist aber im Sinne der Qualitätsverbesserung gerechtfertigt.

AB  - Abstract Semantic processing is central to cognition and is supported by widely distributed gray matter (GM) regions and white matter (WM) tracts. The exact manner in which GM regions are anatomically connected to process semantics remains unknown. We mapped the semantic anatomical network (connectome) by conducting diffusion imaging tractography in 48 healthy participants across 90 GM ?nodes,? and correlating the integrity of each obtained WM edge and semantic performance across 80 brain-damaged patients. Fifty-three WM edges were obtained whose lower integrity associated with semantic deficits and together with their linked GM nodes constitute a semantic WM network. Graph analyses of this network revealed three structurally segregated modules that point to distinct semantic processing components and identified network hubs and connectors that are central in the communication across the subnetworks. Together, our results provide an anatomical framework of human semantic network, advancing the understanding of the structural substrates supporting semantic processing.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have successfully classified 86% of malignant melanomas using a relative-color segmentation method, by feature extraction from photographic images in the automatic identification of skin tumors. These studies were extended by applying the relative-color method to dermoscopic images of melanoma grouped with melanoma in situ and clark nevus lesions in dermoscopic images allow more control over lighting variations, which contribute to lesion misclassification. Dermoscopic images then enable a more detailed examination of the structure of skin lesions, provide much more structural detail within lesions, and contain visual information that cannot be seen in photographic images. This present work extends the previous studies by applying relative-color feature extraction to dermoscopic images to differentiate among melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi. Objective: To develop a method for automatically differentiating among malignant melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi, using digitized, color, dermoscopic images. Methods: Images underwent preprocessing, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and tumor classification. The relative-color method was used in the segmentation stage. Classification was accomplished by taking the inner products of model tumor feature vectors with test-image tumor vectors followed by the nearest-neighbor classification method. Results: The classification rates of melanoma, seborrheic keratoses and Reed/Spitz nevi images mixed together, were 60%, 58.3% and 80%, respectively. Classification of melanoma and Reed/Spitz nevi mixed, were 70% and 90%, respectively. Classification rates were the best when melanoma was being differentiated from seborrheic keratoses. These rates were 100% and 88.9%, respectively. Conclusion: Dermoscopic rather than photographic images were preprocessed, using a hair-removal technique. They were then converted to relative-color images, which were segmented using the principal components transform and median split, followed by morphological filtering. After processing, the multi-dimensional tumor feature space described herein was used to differentiate the tumors. The high success rates for differentiating seborrheic keratoses from melanoma show that the use of dermoscopic images has a strong promise in enabling prescreening, as well as automated assistance and significant improvement in tumor diagnosis in clinics.

AB  - Thoracolumbar disc herniation was diagnosed in a two-year-old ferret using a myelogram followed by a computed tomography scan. The ferret was paraplegic with no control over urination and defecation. Conservative treatment that included cage rest and passive range of motion exercises for three weeks followed by extensive physiotherapy and hydrotherapy resulted in full recovery two months after the onset of treatment. Although intervertebral disc disease has been reported previously in four ferrets, this is the first report in which a postmyelogram computed tomography was used to demonstrate the herniated disc, and physiotherapy was used as principal treatment modality.

AB  - Objective To examine perioperative mortality, long-term survival, causes of death, and prognostic factors for dogs and cats undergoing surgical excision of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Eighty dogs and 32 cats. Methods Follow-up information was obtained for dogs and cats that underwent surgical excision of a TET between 2001 and 2012. Results Perioperative mortality was 20% in dogs and 22% in cats. No independent risk factors for perioperative mortality were identified. The estimated median survival time for all dogs was 1.69 years (95% CI 0.56?4.32) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 55% (95% CI 44?67) and 44% (95% CI 32?56). The estimated median survival time for all cats was 3.71 years (95% CI 0.56-unestimatable) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 70% (95% CI 53?87) and 47% (95% CI 0?100). Of animals that survived to discharge, 42% of dogs and 20% of cats eventually died of TET-related causes. The presence of paraneoplastic syndromes (hazard ratio [HR] 5.78, 95% CI 1.64?20.45, P?=?.007) or incomplete histologic margins (HR 6.09, 95% CI 1.50?24.72, P?=?.01) were independently associated with decreased survival in dogs. No significant predictors of survival were identified in cats. Conclusions regarding the effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy could not be made. Conclusions While there is substantial risk of perioperative death in dogs and cats undergoing surgery for TETs, many animals that survive to discharge have prolonged survival. Survival is significantly decreased in dogs with paraneoplastic syndromes or incomplete histologic margins.

AB  - Abstract Objective Intra-operative fluoroscopy is a valuable tool for visualizing underlying bone, implant, and surgical tool positions in orthopedics. It has brought about the minimally invasive surgical technique of intramedullar nailing to fix femoral shaft fractures. However, the limited field of view and two-dimensional property of fluoroscopic images aggravate intra-operative control of surgical parameters. The purpose of this article is to introduce a surgical navigation system based on fluoroscopy that provides missing information for the procedure of femoral fracture fixation. Materials and Methods Optoelectronic markers are placed on a surgical drill, involved bone fragments, the femoral nail, and the fluoroscope to track their positions. Projection properties of the fluoroscope are acquired through an initial precalibration. The relative positions of bone fragments, implants, and surgical tools are displayed superimposed simultaneously and in real time on multi-planar intra-operative fluoroscopic images. This is achieved by computer simulation of X-ray projections that have taken place with acquisition of the fluoroscopic images. In addition, a method has been developed that allows contactless measurement of three-dimensional anatomic landmarks, based on their representation in fluoroscopic images. In combination with optoelectronic tracking, this enables dynamic calculation of important surgical parameters such as femoral antetorsion. Results A pilot surgery showed that fracture reduction can benefit from the developed computer-assisted method. An in-vitro study on computer-assisted measurement of femoral antetorsion demonstrated the high degree of precision of this technique. Comp Aid Surg 5:311?325 (2000). ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate whether dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis have decreased lumbar paraspinal muscle transverse area and symmetry compared with control dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cross-sectional study comparing muscles in transverse T2-weighted magnetic resonance images for nine dogs with and nine dogs without degenerative -lumbosacral stenosis. Mean transverse area was measured for the lumbar multifidus and sacrocaudalis dorsalis lateralis muscles bilaterally and the L7 vertebral body at the level of the caudal endplate. Transverse areas of both muscle groups relative to L7 and asymmetry indices were compared between study populations using independent t tests. RESULTS Mean muscle-to-L7 transverse area ratios were significantly smaller in the degenerative lumbosacral stenosis group compared with those in the control group in both lumbar multifidus (0·84 ±0·26 versus 1·09 ±0·25; P=0·027) and sacrocaudalis dorsalis lateralis (0·5?±0·15 versus 0·68 ±0·12; P=0·005) muscles. Mean asymmetry indices were higher for both muscles in the group with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis than in the control group, but highly variable and the difference was not statistically significant. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE These findings suggest that dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis have decreased lumbar paraspinal muscle mass that may be a cause or consequence of the -syndrome. Understanding altered paraspinal muscle characteristics may improve understanding of the -pathophysiology and management options for degenerative lumbosacral stenosis.

AB  - Abstract We hypothesise that following a bone fracture there is systemic recruitment of bone forming cells to a fracture site. A rabbit ulnar osteotomy model was adapted to trace the movement of osteogenic cells. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 41 NZW rabbits were isolated, culture-expanded and fluorescently labelled. The labelled cells were either re-implanted into the fracture gap (Group A); into a vein (Group B); or into a remote tibial bone marrow cavity 48 h after the osteotomy (Group C) or 4 weeks before the osteotomy was established (Group D), and a control group (Group E) had no labelled cells given. To quantify passive leakage of cells to an injury site, inert beads were also co-delivered in Group B. Samples of the fracture callus tissue and various organs were harvested at discrete sacrifice time-points to trace and quantify the labelled cells. At 3 weeks following osteotomy, the number of labelled cells identified in the callus of Group C, was significantly greater than following IV delivery, Group B, and there was no difference in the number of labelled cells in the callus tissues, between Groups C and A, indicating the labelled bone marrow cells were capable of migrating to the fracture sites from the remote bone marrow cavity. Significantly fewer inert beads than labelled cells were identified in Group B callus, suggesting some of the bone-forming cells were actively recruited and selectively chosen to the fracture site, rather than passively leaked into the circulation and to bone injury site. This investigation supports the hypothesis that some osteoblasts involved in fracture healing were systemically mobilised and recruited to the fracture from remote bone marrow sites. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.
