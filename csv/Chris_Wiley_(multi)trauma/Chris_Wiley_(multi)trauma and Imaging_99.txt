AB  - Objective The role of bacterial infection in the causation of disc degeneration and its consequences is controversial. The current evidence is limited to underpowered studies, with the majority of such studies having only an internal contaminant arm, and only one study having a control arm with a non-degenerate disc population. The Degenerate-disc Infection Study with Contaminant Control (DISC) study includes a control arm and an internal contaminant control to resolve these shortcomings. Methods The study is designed as a case-control study: cases are patients undergoing surgery for degenerated disc pathology and controls are patients undergoing surgery for non-degenerate pathology, such as trauma, scoliosis or tumor cases. Results This study is part of a multi-centric trial involving six spine centers with 15 spine surgeons contributing. The DISC study methodology, rationale and controversies are presented here. The predominant issue is how to interpret contamination. We present our algorithm for the DISC study to address this. For disc samples that are positive concurrently with positive paraspinal tissue sample, the result will be interpreted as contamination. For positive disc samples with a negative paraspinal tissue culture result, the interpretation of this result will be infection. If cultures for both disc sample and paraspinal tissue sample are negative, then the result is interpreted as non-infected. If the disc culture is negative but paraspinal tissue culture is positive, then it is treated as a contaminant. Conclusions Future large-scale studies are required with a good control arm, a contamination arm, and histopathological correlations.

AB  - Abstract This study presents the excavation and multidisciplinary analysis of seven skeletons recovered in a World War I Mass Grave on the mountains of the Veneto Region, Italy. While it is not a rare phenomenon to these mountainous areas involved in the First Conflict, it is exceptional, on these mountains, to find a mass grave with soldiers in primary burials. Stratigraphic excavation was the mean used for recovery, along with 3D laser scanning documentation. Every skeleton but one was found complete and in anatomical connection. Four soldiers lay in the prone position; two subjects were lying on their side. Identification of the nationality was performed for two of the subjects, who both of whom had personal effects such as a badge for military vaccinations and religious medals. What remained of their uniforms gave clues about their Italian nationality. The entomological analysis conducted on fly puparia discovered close to the bones revealed that the bodies had not been buried immediately. The skeletons were biologically profiled by sex, age, height and ancestry. An accurate study of pathology and stress markers was carried on, as well as on skeletal trauma in order to establish the type of trauma and ammunition involved. The remains belonged altogether to seven Italian male soldiers ages between 18 and 35. Various kinds of stress markers revealed occupational (enthesopathies) and metabolic stress: several signs of cribra cranii and of cribra orbitalia were registered. The study of the injuries revealed a surprising variety of types of lesions, mostly lethal: a few subjects were struck by a shrapnel grenade; one soldier was killed by a grenade explosion. Two of the soldiers were probably executed, instead: this conclusion reached on the basis of gunshot holes (9 mm) in their skulls, and by the position of the injuries.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate post-war context have forced us to re-think our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention. Recognizing the role of culture has allowed us to rethink trauma-in-context, how people and communities understand trauma, and how to explore the most effective psychotherapeutic treatments in these post-war cultural contexts. Dawes and Honwana (Children, culture and mental health: Interventions in Conditions of War. In B. Efraime Jr, P. Riedesser, J. Walter, H. Adam, & P. Steudtner (Eds), Children, war and persecution ? rebuilding hope. Maputo: Rebuilding Hope, 1998) suggest a holistic view of the individual-in-context in order to fully understand the meaning an individual brings and gives to a stressful experience. This perspective allows also for an understanding of the healing resources within a community available to the individual, and the psychologist, dealing with a traumatic event. By exploring both the universal and specific cultural dimensions of trauma, while working with former child soldiers on Josina Machel Island, Mozambique, the authors seek to illuminate how these cultural dimensions, and wealth of healing resources, shaped their understanding of culture in the treatment process and the creation of treatment teams. A comprehensive cultural understanding also allowed the author to use and integrate important cultural dimensions of understanding in to the treatment process to aid in the elaboration of traumatic events associated with being a child soldier. These treatment methods are described via a case example, which represents much of the work carried out with the community of Josina Machel. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Aim Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a growing and largely underestimated problem without defined etiology. Herein, we sought to determine the relationship between cognitive decline, blood?brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and inflammation, namely high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), after surgery in aged rats. Methods Aged rats were randomly assigned as surgery group (n = 45, splenectomy under general anesthesia), anesthesia (n = 45, 2% isoflurane for 2 h), and naïve control (n = 15). Markers of inflammation were measured in plasma and brain. Blood?brain barrier ultrastructure and permeability were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and IgG immunohistochemistry. Cognitive function was assessed in a reversal learning version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Results Surgical trauma under general anesthesia caused distinct changes in systemic and central proinflammatory cytokines. Levels of HMGB1 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of operated animals. Immunohistochemistry and TEM showed BBB disruption induced by surgery and anesthesia. These molecular changes were associated with cognitive impairment in latency with the MWM up to postoperative day 3. Conclusions HMGB1 and RAGE signaling appear pivotal mediators of surgery-induced cognitive decline and may contribute to the changes in BBB permeability after peripheral surgical trauma.

AB  - Summary Background The objective assessment of the mechanical properties of the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) could provide useful information for the rehabilitation of horses with SDFT injuries. Assessment of strain ratio (the strain of a standard reference divided by that of lesions) is a quantitative method in sonoelastography for evaluating tissue stiffness in vivo. As yet, no longitudinal studies have used strain ratio to evaluate the progression of stiffness in SDFT injuries. Objectives To test the hypothesis that strain ratio can evaluate the recovery of stiffness during the healing of SDFT injuries. Study design Prospective and longitudinal study with observer-blinded evaluation. Methods Ultrasonography, including sonoelastography, was performed in seven Thoroughbred horses with naturally occurring SDFT injuries at five time points: within 20 days of the injury, and at 2, 3, 6 and 9 months after the injury. Blinded sonoelastographic images were independently evaluated by two veterinarians to assess interobserver agreement. The recovery of stiffness and echogenicity in lesions were evaluated using the strain ratio and grey-scale ratio (echogenicity of lesions divided by that of the surrounding area), respectively. Results Interobserver agreement was assessed as ?almost perfect?. Strain ratios were significantly higher at 9 months after injury than at the other time points (all P<0.05). Strain ratios at 6 months after injury were significantly higher than those at earlier time points (P<0.05). Grey-scale ratios within 20 days of injury were significantly lower than those at the other time points (all P<0.05). Main limitations Validations of SDFT status were evaluated only by recovery of the echogenicity in lesions and not by histopathological examination. Conclusions Although further studies are needed to validate the relationships between injured SDFT status and sonoelastographic findings, this preliminary study shows that strain ratio may provide a means to monitor the recovery of stiffness in lesions during rehabilitation, even when the grey-scale ratio remains unchanged from a few months after SDFT injury.

AB  - Abstract Background? Inter-observer variability limits the reproducibility of pelvic floor motion measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our aim was to develop a semi-automated program measuring pelvic floor motion in a reproducible and refined manner. Methods? Pelvic floor anatomy and motion during voluntary contraction (squeeze) and rectal evacuation were assessed by MRI in 64 women with fecal incontinence (FI) and 64 age-matched controls. A radiologist measured anorectal angles and anorectal junction motion. A semi-automated program did the same and also dissected anorectal motion into perpendicular vectors representing the puborectalis and other pelvic floor muscles, assessed the pubococcygeal angle, and evaluated pelvic rotation. Key Results? Manual and semi-automated measurements of anorectal junction motion (r?=?0.70; P?<?0.0001) during squeeze and evacuation were correlated, as were anorectal angles at rest, squeeze, and evacuation; angle change during squeeze or evacuation was less so. Semi-automated measurements of anorectal and pelvic bony motion were also reproducible within subjects. During squeeze, puborectalis injury was associated (P?≤?0.01) with smaller puborectalis but not pelvic floor motion vectors, reflecting impaired puborectalis function. The pubococcygeal angle, reflecting posterior pelvic floor motion, was smaller during squeeze and larger during evacuation. However, pubococcygeal angles and pelvic rotation during squeeze and evacuation did not differ significantly between FI and controls. Conclusion & Inferences? This semi-automated program provides a reproducible, efficient, and refined analysis of pelvic floor motion by MRI. Puborectalis injury is independently associated with impaired motion of puborectalis, not other pelvic floor muscles in controls and women with FI.

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - Summary Forensic imaging methods provide a number of advantages over/or additionally to traditional autopsy in identifying and documenting information pertinent to the case. The medicolegal autopsy is applied in even more countries as an indispensable examination in the case of suspicious death. It also has a research potential as many cases of interest to society are examined by the forensic expert who will achieve an overview of a lot of case categories, such as sudden unexpected death and intoxications. This chapter discusses aspects of external and internal examination, and adoption of special procedures for medicolegal autopsy. Clinical autopsies have a multitude of inherent benefits. New diseases are discovered, the statistics concerning cause of death and the spectre of disease will find a sound basis in the autopsy. Neuropathological autopsy, and microbiological autopsy are discussed in the chapter. The chapter also presents the sample structure of an autopsy report.

AB  - Objective To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (?ear cleaners?) against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections. Methods Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test. Results Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. Clinical Significance Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.

AB  - Abstract Studies presented here, using a murine model of bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP2)-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) show that the protein initiates HO by signaling through progenitors in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves. In the mouse, these cells were identified in the endoneurium one day after BMP2 induction using antibody against phosphoSMAD (PS) 1, 5, and 8. Studies conducted in a tracking mouse that contains a tamoxifen-regulated Wnt1-Cre recombinase crossed with a td Tomato red (TR) reporter (Wnt1CreErt:Ai9Tm) confirmed their neural origin. In this model both BMP2 induction and tamoxifen are absolutely required to induce TR. SP7+(osterix+)TR+ cells were found in the endoneurium on day 1 and associated with bone on day 7. Quantification of TR+ and TR? cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that all SP7+ cells were found in the TR+ population, whereas only about 80% of the TR+ cells expressed SP7. Pre-chondrocytes (Sox 9+) and transient brown fat (tBAT, UCP1+) also coexpressed TR, suggesting that the progenitor in nerves is multi-potential. The endoneurium of human nerves near the site of HO contained many PS+ cells, and SP7+ cells were found in nerves and on bone in tissue from patients with HO. Control tissues and nerves did not contain these PS+ and SP7+ cells. Some osteoblasts on bone from patients with HO were positive for PS, suggesting the continued presence of BMP during bone formation. The data suggests that the progenitors for HO are derived from the endoneurium in both the mouse model of HO and in humans with HO. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1109?1119

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between classes and associated psychological disorders and stressful life-events. Results. A 4-class solution provided the best fit, ranging from a class with a low probability of showing any BPD symptoms to a class whose members had a relatively high probability of endorsing all criteria. Severity of BPD was associated with higher co-morbidity and higher stressful life-events. Conclusions. Results suggest that four discrete classes make up the borderline continuum.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.

AB  - ABSTRACT The main function of adipose tissue has been considered as storage of triglycerides. Adipose tissue was considered harmful for healing extensive and deep burns because of poor circulation and easy liquefaction in wound beds, which offer an excellent culture medium for bacteria. However, these traditional concepts have been challenged with the discovery of the endocrine function of adipose tissue. To investigate the effects of adipose tissue extract on wound healing, we created four 3.0 ? 2.5?cm full-thickness wounds on each side of the back of male Wu Zhi Shan minipigs (n=6), for eight wounds in each animal. The wounds were randomly divided to receive normal saline (0.5?mL; controls), adipose tissue extract (1.5?g), basic fibroblast growth factor (50?U/cm2), and epidermal growth factor (50?U/cm2). Reduction in wound area and wound volume was accelerated with adipose tissue treatment as compared with growth factor or control treatment. The thickness of the regenerated epidermis and the number of new vascular nets were markedly increased in adipose tissue-treated wounds. Biopsy of adipose tissue-treated wounds showed enhanced expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Factor VIII-related antigen, which indicated active cell differentiation and proliferation. In vitro study in rat tissue showed adipose tissue extracts stimulating skin growth. Bacteriology results showed no significant differences in amount or type of bacteria, whatever the treatment. These results may challenge the traditional concept that adipose tissue plays a negative role in wound healing and may offer direct evidence for encouraging the retention of adipose tissue in autologous skin grafting for skin wounds.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Objectives To assess the efficacy of cognitive existential couple therapy (CECT) for relationship function, coping, cancer distress and mental health in men with localised prostate cancer and in their partners. Patients Subjects and Methods A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 62 couples randomly assigned to the six-session CECT programme or care as usual. The couple's relationship function (primary outcome), and coping, cancer distress and mental health (secondary outcomes) were evaluated at T0 (baseline), T1 (after treatment) and T2 (9 months from T0). A repeated-measures analysis of covariance model, which incorporated T0 measurements as a covariate, was used to compare treatment groups at T1 and T2. Results After CECT, patients reported significantly greater use of adaptive coping (P = 0.03) and problem-focused coping (P = 0.01). These gains were maintained at follow-up, while relationship cohesion had improved (P = 0.03), as had relationship function for younger patients (P = 0.01). Younger partners reported less cancer-specific distress (P = 0.008), avoidance (P = 0.04), intrusive thought (P = 0.006), and hyperarousal (P = 0.01). Gains were maintained at follow-up, while relationship cohesion (P = 0.007), conflict resolution (P = 0.01) and relational function (P = 0.009) all improved. Conclusion CECT resulted in improved coping for patients and lower cancer-distress for partners. Maintained over time this manifests as improved relationship function. CECT was acceptable to couples, alleviated long-term relationship decline, and is therefore suitable as a preventative mental health intervention for couples facing prostate cancer. Given resourcing demands, we recommend dissemination of CECT be targeted at younger couples, as CECT was more acceptable to the younger group, and they derived greater benefit from it.
