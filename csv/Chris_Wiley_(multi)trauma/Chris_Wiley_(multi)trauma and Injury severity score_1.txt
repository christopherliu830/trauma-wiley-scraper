AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To review the literature addressing the assessment and management of pain in patients with polytraumatic injuries including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-related headache, and to identify patient, clinician and systems factors associated with pain-related outcomes. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? We conducted searches in MEDLINE of literature published from 1950 through July 2008. Due to a limited number of studies using controls or comparators, we included observational and rigorous qualitative studies. We systematically rated the quality of systematic reviews, cohort, and case-control design studies. Results.? One systematic review, 93 observational studies, and one qualitative research study met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded no published studies that assessed measures of pain intensity or pain-related functional interference among patients with cognitive deficits due to TBI, that compared patients with blast-related headache with patients with other types of headache, or that assessed treatments for blast-related headache pain. Studies on the association between TBI severity and pain reported mixed findings. There was limited evidence that the following factors are associated with pain among TBI patients: severity, location, and multiplicity of injuries; insomnia; fatigue; depression; and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions.? Very little evidence is currently available to guide pain assessment and treatment approaches in patients with polytrauma. Further research employing systematic observational as well as controlled intervention designs is clearly indicated.
