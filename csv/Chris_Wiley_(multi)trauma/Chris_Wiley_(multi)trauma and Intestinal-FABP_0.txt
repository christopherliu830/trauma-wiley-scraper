AB  - Purpose:?? To investigate intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, in both rat intestinal ischaemia reperfusion injury, and in human necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Methodology:?? Plasma was collected from anaesthetized rats that underwent intestinal ischaemia reperfusion (IIR) injury and from control rats undergoing sham laparotomy. In a separate study, plasma and urine was collected from infants with NEC, and from control infants with non-abdominal diagnoses. iFABP was measured in urine and plasma using a commercially available ELISA. SMA was detected in plasma using a western blot technique. Results are median [IQR] and compared by Mann-Whitney test unless otherwise stated. Results:?? Animal model: Plasma iFABP was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with control group (IRI 32.4 [29.2] ng/ml vs. control 3.8 [3.3] ng/ml; p < 0.01). SMA became detectable in IRI plasma during reperfusion (p < 0.01 compared with pre-ischaemia, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test), but never in the control group. Human NEC Study:?? Urinary iFABP was significantly higher in the NEC group (2.1 [3.9] pg/nmol) compared to controls (1.1 [0.7] pg/nmol, p, < 0.05). Furthermore plasma and urinary iFABP correlated with extent of intestinal damage at laparotomy, and decreased with NEC resolution. SMA was detectable in the plasma of infants with multifocal or panintestinal NEC, but in neither focal nor non-operative disease. Conclusion:?? FABP and SMA are markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, and may offer clinically relevant information in the diagnosis and management of severe intestinal disease.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Purpose:?? Stoma formation is a standard procedure in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the incidence seems to remain high. Here, we performed a prospective study on 137 patients with ileostomy or colostomy in order to identify potential risk factors. Methodology:?? 137 patients received stomas and were prospectively followed up four times after surgery. Early and late stoma complications, potential risk factors, and QOL were recorded using a modified SF-36 form. Results were subjected to statistical analysis and discussed with the view onto the current literature. Results:?? 72 patients received a colostomy and 65 patients an ileostomy. There was a complication rate of 55.5% (n = 76). 53 patients had early, 44 patients had late, and some had both early and late complications. Early complications occurred less than two months after surgery and included necrosis (16.1%), abscess (13.9%), and dehiscence (10.9%). Late complications included parastomal hernia (11.7%), chronic peristomal skin alteration (8.8%), stenosis (6.6%), prolaps (3.6%), and retraction 0.7%). 15 patients with late stoma complications needed surgery. High body mass index, emergency procedure, and omitted preoperative stoma marking were associated with significant higher risks for developing stoma complications. The availability of a stoma nurse greatly influenced outcome and QOL. Conclusion:?? Stoma complications are not rare and the surgeon should pay special attention to details of the technique. QOL of stoma patients is greatly influenced by specially trained stoma nurses. The identified risk factors have to be considered in order to reduce the incidence of stoma complications in the future.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.

AB  - Summary Background The prevalence of exercise-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms has been reported up to 70%. The pathophysiology largely remains unknown. Aim To review the physiological and pathophysiological changes of the GI-tract during physical exercise and the management of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods Search of the literature published in the English and Dutch languages using the Pubmed database to review the literature that focused on the relation between splanchnic blood flow (SBF), development of ischaemia, postischaemic endotoxinemia and motility. Results During physical exercise, the increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) redistributes blood flow from the splanchnic organs to the working muscles. With prolonged duration and/or intensity, the SBF may be decreased by 80% or more. Most studies point in the direction of increased SNS-activity as central driving force for reduction in SBF. A severely reduced SBF may frequently cause GI ischaemia. GI-ischaemia combined with reduced vagal activity probably triggers changes in GI-motility and GI absorption derangements. GI-symptoms during physical exercise may be prevented by lowering the exercise intensity, preventing dehydration and avoiding the ingestion of hypertonic fluids. Conclusions Literature on the pathophysiology of exercise-induced GI-symptoms is scarce. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreased splanchnic blood flow during physical exercise seems to be the key factor in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced GI-symptoms, and this should be the target for symptom reduction.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Background:?? Necrotising fasciitis is a soft tissue infection with progressive tissue necrosis, affecting the deep fascial layers. It is a rare life-threatening disease with mortality rates from 6.1?43%. Many factors have been associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these factors by analysing data from a larger patient series than any presented in the published literature to date. Methods:?? The medical records of 151 sequential patients with necrotising fasciitis treated in the Alfred Hospital from 1997?2004 were reviewed to identify the factors associated with increased mortality. The data was then analysed with multivariate analysis to identify the statistically significant factors. Results:?? Mortality rate of this study was 11.3%. The statistically significant factors were CRP > 200 on admission (p = 0.018), mechanical ventilation on admission (p = 0.002), older age (p = 0.0231), male (p = 0.013), delayed hyperbaric therapy from first symptoms (p = 0.045), spontaneous precipitant (p = 0.015), and complications of multi organ failure (p = 0.006), acute renal failure (0.011), acidosis (p = 0.001) or atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), sepsis (p = 0.045). Conclusions:?? The knowledge of these factors will assist in the management of necrotising fasciitis by prioritising these patients, allocating more appropriate resources to prevent delay in hyperbaric treatment and by promptly treat the disease, especially in ICU setting to prevent complications and improve survival.

AB  - Abstract Almost every living thing requires iron (including aerobic, and facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria) because iron plays key roles in a broad range of physiologically essential molecular processes ranging from catalysis, oxygen transport, and oxidative phosphorylation to structuring proteins. The useful redox properties of iron enable its utility in these molecular functions, but its scarcity in the environment in bioavailable forms, coupled with the double-edged nature of its redox properties (which can lead to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species), require complicated acquisition, transport, and storage mechanisms, both by environmental microbes and by higher animals. These iron acquisition mechanisms come into direct conflict when microbes compete with each other for this scarce resource in the environment and when pathogenic bacteria infect animal hosts. A very simple and potently effective strategy employed by many animals to ward off bacterial and fungal infections, at least in the early stages while pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses are developing, is to further constrict the already tightly controlled endogenous iron budget, starving invading microbial pathogens of needed iron. The complicated system of endogenous iron transport permits these changes in response to infection. However, in a countering response, successful pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to evade this defense, the simplest and most dramatic of which is perhaps exemplified by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, which has evolved away from the need for any iron whatsoever. Bacteria and protists have also developed sophisticated and complicated mechanisms to access heme-associated iron directly. However, other strategies developed by microbes to compete with each other for iron in the environment, mediated by small-molecule iron chelators called siderophores, are, in turn, useful to access the otherwise restricted pool of iron in transit in the body, carried as complexes with specific iron-binding proteins. To counter siderophore-mediated iron pilfering, animals have developed a panel of siderophore-specific binding proteins (siderocalins) to steal the iron (and siderophore) back. To subvert this counterstrategy, successful pathogenic bacteria modify their siderophores into stealthy forms that cannot bind to host siderocalins. As with any arms race (e.g., the process of evolution), the cycle of response/counterresponse is likely to continue ad infinitum.

AB  - Background:?? Biologically active factors produced by the intestine and transported by the protein fraction of mesenteric lymph are thought to contribute significantly to the development of distant organ failure in haemorrhagic shock. Despite the likely relevance of the protein composition of mesenteric lymph conditioned by haemorrhagic shock, there is no detailed description of its proteome. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive description of the proteome of haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph. Methods:?? 20 male Wistar rats were randomized to either control or haemorrhagic shock group. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 30?mmHg in the shock group for 90 minutes followed by resuscitation and mesenteric lymph collection for another 90 minutes. Proteomic changes in mesenteric lymph due to haemorrhagic shock were identified using LC-MS/MS. Results:?? 245 proteins were identified in mesenteric lymph, including 35 hypothetical proteins. 60 of the 245 proteins had a significant increase in their relative abundance in the haemorrhagic shock group vs. sham group. Potentially toxic pancreatic enzymes had increased abundance in post-shock mesenteric lymph. In addition, a bioinformatics approach allowed for the identification of key pathways relating to defence and metabolic responses. A number of potentially important proteins were also identified as targets for future research in hemorrhagic shock: peroxiredoxins, 14-3-3 zeta/epsilon, calmodulin, cofilin, and profilin. Conclusions:?? This study not only provides the first comprehensive list of protein changes in the haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph, but also provides rational for future research.
