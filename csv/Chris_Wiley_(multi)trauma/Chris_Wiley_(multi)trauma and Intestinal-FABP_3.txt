AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.
