AB  - Abstract Whilst the importance of mutations in a wide range of keratins in skin fragility disorders is now well established, there is much less evidence for simple epithelial keratin involvement in disease. Some simple epithelial keratin mutations have been reported in liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis patients, and recently mutations in the simple epithelial keratin K8 were identified in a group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis). In comparison with the mutations seen in epidermal keratins, these simple epithelial mutations would be predicted to have mild consequences, although analysis shows that they do have a distinct effect. This review article discusses the evidence that these mutations are a predisposing factor for inflammatory bowel disease. Copyright ? 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - Background: We previously identified compound niches (CNs) at the limbal:corneal border of the mouse cornea that contain corneal epithelial progenitor cells, express Keratin 8 (K8), and goblet cell mucin Muc5AC. During re-epithelialization after 2.5?mm epithelial debridement wounds, CNs migrate onto the cornea and expand in number mimicking conjunctivalization. When CNs form during development and whether they express corneal epithelial progenitor cell enriched K14 was not known. Results: To provide insight into corneal epithelial homeostasis, we quantify changes in expression of simple (K8, K18, K19) and stratified squamous epithelial keratins (K5, K12, K14, and K15) during postnatal development and in response to 2.5?mm wounds using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), confocal imaging and immunoblots. K14?+?CNs are present 7 days after birth. By 21 days, when the eyelids are open, K8, K19, and Muc5AC are also expressed in CNs. By 28 days after wounding, the corneal epithelium shows enhanced mRNA and protein expression for K14 and retains mRNA and protein for corneal epithelial specific K12. Conclusions: The keratin phenotype observed in corneal epithelial cells before eyelid opening is similar to that seen during wound healing. Data show K14?+?corneal epithelial progenitor cells expand in number after 2.5?mm wounds. Developmental Dynamics 245:132?143, 2016. ? 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The pattern of epithelial keratin expression in the normal anal canal has not been extensively defined and is a necessary prerequisite to the interpretation of alterations in these intermediate filaments in pathological anal epithelial lesions. Thirty-five frozen tissue specimens of resected haemorrhoids were investigated immunohistolo-gically for expression of 14 individual keratins (K) using a panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies. Perianal skin showed basal expression of karatinocyte Ks 5, 14 and 17, and suprabasal expression of keratinocyte Ks 14, 10, 1 and 16. Anal squamous epithelium showed persistent basal K5 and 17, basal and suprabasal K4, 13 and 16 positivity, with sporadic expression of K1 and 10. The expression of simple epithelial keratins in squamous epithelium adjacent to the anal transitional zone varied with basal expression of K7, K8, K18 and K19 and sporadic suprabasal expression of K7 and K19. The anal transitional zone (ATZ) expressed K19, as found in transitional epithelia elsewhere. The full thickness of epithelium was positive for the simple epithelial Ks 7, 8 18 and 19. Marked heterogeneity of keratinocyte keratin expression was seen. Basal layers expressed Ks 4, 13, 14 and 17 and variably K16, while suprabasal layers expressed Ks4 and 13, 14 and 17 and variably K16, while suprabasal layers expressed Ks4 and 13 and variably K14, 16 and 17. This anomalous expression of keratinocyte K4 and 13 has also been documented in transitional epithelium of the bladder. The anal glands and ducts showed a keratin distribution similar to the transition zone. Rectal columnar epithelium expressed simple keratins 7, 8 18 and 19. In addition, low levels of keratinocyte keratins were found as indicated by heterogeneous staining for K4, 13, 14 and 16. The overall pattern, particularly in the region of the anal transitional zone and immediately adjacent squamous and columnar epithelia, is of a flexible epithelial cell population able to express a range of keratins unrestricted by a particular morphological phenotype. In the light of these results, analysis of changes in keratin distribution within anal carcinomas may assist classification by providing information on the state of differentiation and histogenesis of these tumours.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Our aims are to review animal models of tauopathies, which include a number of brain disorders with various aetiologies, including ageing, genetics, infectious diseases, toxins, trauma and other unknown factors. Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of filaments of the microtubule-associated tau protein. The different aetiopathogeneses and distinct molecular events involved in tau aggregation have led to the development of various animal models for these diseases. In this review, rather than listing all current models, we focus on specific animal models addressing, among others, the question of tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregation and tau spreading. Physiological conditions, including normal ageing and hibernation, may exhibit tau phosphorylation and some aspects of tauopathies. However, most of the models of tauopathies involve genetically modified animals (mostly rodents, but also fruit fly, zebrafish and worm). Some of these models have been crucial for the development of therapeutic approaches in humans. The present review shows the difficulty in pinpointing a specific mechanism that may be targeted in tauopathies but also opens up new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract Historically, the term ?keratin? stood for all of the proteins extracted from skin modifications, such as horns, claws and hooves. Subsequently, it was realized that this keratin is actually a mixture of keratins, keratin filament-associated proteins and other proteins, such as enzymes. Keratins were then defined as certain filament-forming proteins with specific physicochemical properties and extracted from the cornified layer of the epidermis, whereas those filament-forming proteins that were extracted from the living layers of the epidermis were grouped as ?prekeratins? or ?cytokeratins?. Currently, the term ?keratin? covers all intermediate filament-forming proteins with specific physicochemical properties and produced in any vertebrate epithelia. Similarly, the nomenclature of epithelia as cornified, keratinized or non-keratinized is based historically on the notion that only the epidermis of skin modifications such as horns, claws and hooves is cornified, that the non-modified epidermis is a keratinized stratified epithelium, and that all other stratified and non-stratified epithelia are non-keratinized epithelia. At this point in time, the concepts of keratins and of keratinized or cornified epithelia need clarification and revision concerning the structure and function of keratin and keratin filaments in various epithelia of different species, as well as of keratin genes and their modifications, in view of recent research, such as the sequencing of keratin proteins and their genes, cell culture, transfection of epithelial cells, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Recently, new functions of keratins and keratin filaments in cell signaling and intracellular vesicle transport have been discovered. It is currently understood that all stratified epithelia are keratinized and that some of these keratinized stratified epithelia cornify by forming a Stratum corneum. The processes of keratinization and cornification in skin modifications are different especially with respect to the keratins that are produced. Future research in keratins will provide a better understanding of the processes of keratinization and cornification of stratified epithelia, including those of skin modifications, of the adaptability of epithelia in general, of skin diseases, and of the changes in structure and function of epithelia in the course of evolution. This review focuses on keratins and keratin filaments in mammalian tissue but keratins in the tissues of some other vertebrates are also considered.

AB  - Abstract Keratin (K) intermediate filament proteins form cytoskeletal scaffolds in epithelia, the disruption of which leads to a large number of human disorders. KRT5 or KRT14 mutations cause epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). The considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in EBS suggests modifying loci, most of which are unknown. In many human disorders, chaperones and the ubiquitin?proteasome system have been found to modify disease severity, thereby providing novel therapy targets. Here, we demonstrate upregulation of stress-induced Hsp70 and Hsp90 in two EBS models, namely, in neonatal K5?/? mice and upon proteasome inhibition in cells that stably express the disease-causing mutation K14?p.Arg125Cys, both harboring keratin aggregates. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition caused nuclear translocation of pHSF-1 and an increase in K14?p.Arg125Cys-positive aggregates in cells. Overexpression of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1 strongly reduced keratin aggregates through increased degradation of mutant K14. Using CHIP?p.Met1_Ala142del (?TPR?CHIP), we demonstrated the involvement of Hsc70 and Hsp70 in mutant keratin degradation. Our data uncover common principles between EBS and other protein misfolding disorders, revealing that aggregation-prone keratins are targeted by components of the chaperone machinery. Thus, modulation of the chaperone machinery using small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for dominant EBS, allowing reformation of an intact keratin cytoskeleton.

AB  - ABSTRACT The goal of this study was to evaluate whether there are sex differences in children's vulnerability to caregiving risk, as indexed by trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms assessed from 2 to 18 months? postpartum, and children's rated attachment security in toddlerhood, adjusting for maternal social support and demographic risk. Analyses utilized longitudinal data collected for 182 African American mother?child dyads from economically diverse backgrounds. Participants were recruited at the time of the child's birth and followed to 18 months? postpartum. Results of conditional latent growth models indicated that an increasing rate of change in level of maternal depressive symptoms over time negatively predicted toddlers? felt attachment security. Higher social support was associated with decreasing levels of maternal depressive symptoms over time whereas higher demographic risk was associated with increasing levels of maternal depressive symptoms. A subsequent multigroup conditional latent growth model revealed that child sex moderated these associations. For male (but not female) children, a rapid increase in maternal depressive symptoms was associated with lower felt attachment security at 18 months. These findings suggest that boys, as compared to girls, may be more vulnerable to early caregiving risks such as maternal depression, with negative consequences for mother?child attachment security in toddlerhood.
