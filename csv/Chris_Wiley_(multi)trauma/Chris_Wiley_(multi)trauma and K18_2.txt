AB  - Summary Dr Sophie Spitz proposed a criterion to distinguish those melanocytic proliferations of childhood that manifested an aggressive biologic behavior from their indolent, but histologically similar, counterparts. The latter are now called Spitz nevi. The Spitz nevus may be junctional, compound, or intradermal. This chapter discusses classical compound Spitz nevus, and dermal Spitz nevus and its nonmelanocytic mimics: neurothekeoma, epithelioid cell histiocytoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, and epithelioid angiosarcoma. The desmoplastic nevus is usually thought to represent a nevus, or, less commonly, a dermatofibroma. The chapter also discusses pagetoid intraepidermal Spitz nevus, pigmented spindle cell nevus, pigmented epithelioid cell nevus and superficial atypical Spitz tumor.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD), and retrovirus-induced avian leukoses/sarcoma (L/S) and reticuloendotheliosis. It covers tumors of unknown etiology. The morphology and morphogenesis of MD virus have been reviewed. Several different types of MD vaccines are in common use, both individually and in various combinations. The most widely used products are low-pathogenic serotype 1 MDV, naturally avirulent herpesvirus of turkey (HVT), and serotype 2 viruses. Lymphoid leukosis (LL) has been the most common form of L/S group of diseases seen in field flocks, although myeloid leukosis has become prevalent. LL, a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens affecting primarily the cloacal bursa (bursa of Fabricius) and visceral organs, is the most common form of leukosis that arises from infection with avian leukosis virus (ALV). Eradication of ALV from primary breeding stocks is the most effective means for controlling ALV infection in chickens.

AB  - Background Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease of dogs and humans. Objectives Our objectives were to describe clinical phenotypes, histopathology and treatment outcomes of canine EBA. Animals Twenty dogs diagnosed with EBA based on a subepidermal blister formation and collagen VII autoreactivity. Results Most dogs were young (median: 1.2-year-old) with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Nine of 20 dogs (45%) developed lesions before one year of age and 11 of 20 dogs (55%) were great danes. Tense vesicles and bullae (18 of 20; 90%) and deep erosions and ulcers (20 of 20; 100%) were the most common lesions and these affected predominantly the oral cavity (19 of 20; 95%), pinnae (16 of 20; 80%), axillae (15 of 20; 75%) and footpads (14 of 20; 70%). Histopathology identified neutrophilic perivascular dermatitis (17 of 17; 100%) without or with (12 of 17; 71%) eosinophils, which occasionally equalled (four cases) or outnumbered neutrophils (two cases). Subepidermal vesicles were either devoid of inflammation or contained neutrophils with or without eosinophils, fibrin and/or haemorrhage. A complete remission of skin lesions was obtained in 14 dogs with a median time of 58 days. Glucocorticoids were used in these dogs either as a monotherapy (3 of 14; 21%) or in combination with other immunomodulating drugs (11 of 14; 79%). The median dose of prednisone was 3 mg/kg/day. The remaining six dogs were euthanized. Conclusions and clinical importance Canine EBA is a rare subepidermal blistering disease with an inflammatory phenotype and a predilection for young great danes and male dogs. The outcome of treatment appears more favourable than assumed previously.

AB  - Summary Viruses are usually classified according to structural principles and genetic homology. Agents causing zoonoses exist in various virus groups that have similarities in the disease patterns that they induce. There may also be similarities involved in hosts and vectors. In this chapter, we have chosen a sequential arrangement following viral classifications for the most part. This sequence makes it possible to point out similarities within individual virus groups. Tables include the geographical distribution and clinical signs that are important for differential diagnosis. Viral zoonoses are also compared with nonviral zoonotic diseases.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely: the herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD); retrovirus-induced avian leukosis/sarcoma, and reticuloendotheliosis. Each of these neoplastic diseases or disease complexes are described in a separate section because of its etiologic distinctness. The chapter also describes tumors of unknown etiology on the basis of morphologic characteristics. Included are a wide variety of benign and malignant neoplasms derived from muscle, epithelial, andnerve tissues; serous membranes; and pigmented cells. Most of the neoplastic diseases can be diagnosed by the characteristic pathological changes in the affected tissues, but confirmed by virological, serological, and molecular methods of diagnosis. While diseases such as MD is controlled mainly by the widespread use of vaccines, most of the retroviral diseases are controlled by eradication of the virus from the infected flocks, supplemented by selection for genetic resistance.
