AB  - Redox-active iron, catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in experimental renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, in clinical transplantation, it is unknown whether redox-active iron is involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury of non-heart-beating (NHB) donor kidneys. We measured redox-active iron concentrations in perfusate samples of 231 deceased donor kidneys that were preserved by machine pulsatile perfusion at our institution between May 1998 and November 2002 using the bleomycin detectable iron assay. During machine pulsatile perfusion, redox-active iron was released into the preservation solution. Ischemically injured NHB donor kidneys had significantly higher perfusate redox-active iron concentrations than heart-beating (HB) donor kidneys that were not subjected to warm ischemia (3.9 ± 1.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.0 ?mol/L, p = 0.001). Moreover, redox-active iron concentration was an independent predictor of post-transplant graft viability (odds ratio 1.68, p = 0.01) and added predictive value to currently available donor and graft characteristics. This was particularly evident in uncontrolled NHB donor kidneys for which there is the greatest uncertainty about transplant outcomes. Therefore, perfusate redox-active iron concentration shows promise as a novel viability marker of NHB donor kidneys.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - Purpose:?? The Apgar score for neonates is well established. Gawande et al (1) recently reported a validated Apgar score for surgery derived for intraoperative parameters (blood loss, lowest heart rate, lowest mean arterial pressure). They studied elective general and vascular surgical patients and demonstrated predictive capability in terms of major complications and death within 30?days. The aim of our study was to determine if the Apgar surgical score was valid and useful in an Australian hospital setting. Methods:?? Elective and emergency surgical procedures over a 31-day period were prospectively studied. The anaesthetic and surgical teams were not aware of the Apgar score. The postoperative course of each patient was reviewed. Primary outcome measures were death or major complications; secondary measures were ICU admission and inpatient length of stay. Results:?? 790 patients were studied and the Apgar score calculated. No correlation was found between Apgar score and complications or death within 30?days. Only 20 (2.5%) had a score of less than 4, and in this group there was 1 death and 6 patients with complications. There were no unplanned ICU admissions. Inpatient length of stay was not shown to be significantly longer in those with lower scores. The Apgar score did not correlate with ASA status. Patients undergoing Caesarean section tended to have poor Apgar scores but excellent outcomes. Conclusion:?? Using the surgical Apgar would not have altered the management of any patient in the study e.g., planning ICU admission etc. and therefore we are unable to recommend its introduction as a routine measure.

AB  - Introduction:?? Although modern surgery is often complex, adherence to simple but critical safety steps have been shown to markedly improve patient outcomes. Aim:?? To review and compare surgical practice at a tertiary surgical centre to recommendations from the WHO Safe Surgery Saves Lives Committee. Methodology:?? Retrospective analysis of all prospectively recorded surgical adverse events over an 18?month period (1st Jan 2007?30th June 2008). These events were compared to the WHO recommendations. Results:?? The tertiary centre practiced all but 3 of the WHO recommendations and 166 surgical adverse events and 23 process failures/near misses were identified. Rate of adverse events was better than the average reported in industrialised nations. Leading adverse events were infection and bleeding/haematoma. Seventeen percent of adverse events identified could have been modified had a ?sign-out? process been followed. Conclusion:?? Implementation of WHO recommendations has the potential to reduce surgical adverse events.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? The aim of the study was to evaluate whether C reactive protein level (CRP) on admission could aid the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado score in acute appendicitis. Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Introduction:?? The goal of an acute general surgical unit (AGSU) is to improve the management of all emergency surgical admissions including those with acute gall bladder disease. In May 2008, John Hunter Hospital Newcastle implemented an AGSU. Changes to service provision included an in-house consultant (7?am to 7?pm) dedicated to acute surgery with access to an afternoon operating list most weekdays. This study compares the management of acute gall bladder disease before and after implementation of the AGSU in the setting of an unchanged policy of operative management during the index admission (where appropriate) for acute gall bladder disease. Method:?? An analysis was performed of all patients admitted via the emergency department with biliary colic or cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical management data and complications were compared for the 6?months of June to November (inclusive) 2007 (pre-AGSU) and 2008 (AGSU). Results:?? In 6?months of 2007, 45 patients were admitted with acute gall bladder disease of which 35 (78%) underwent operative management. By comparison in the same 6?months of 2008, there were 70 admissions, with operative management in 61 (87%). In 2008 average length of stay was 4.24?days (5.07?days in 2007); average time from admission to surgery 34.8?hrs (54.5?hours in 2007, p < 0.05) and, 70.5% of operations occurred between 8?am and 5?pm on a weekday (60% in 2007). Conclusion:?? The provision of an acute gall bladder service is improved within a dedicated acute general surgical unit. This translates to benefits to patients, staff and healthcare economics.

AB  - Background:?? Biologically active factors produced by the intestine and transported by the protein fraction of mesenteric lymph are thought to contribute significantly to the development of distant organ failure in haemorrhagic shock. Despite the likely relevance of the protein composition of mesenteric lymph conditioned by haemorrhagic shock, there is no detailed description of its proteome. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive description of the proteome of haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph. Methods:?? 20 male Wistar rats were randomized to either control or haemorrhagic shock group. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 30?mmHg in the shock group for 90 minutes followed by resuscitation and mesenteric lymph collection for another 90 minutes. Proteomic changes in mesenteric lymph due to haemorrhagic shock were identified using LC-MS/MS. Results:?? 245 proteins were identified in mesenteric lymph, including 35 hypothetical proteins. 60 of the 245 proteins had a significant increase in their relative abundance in the haemorrhagic shock group vs. sham group. Potentially toxic pancreatic enzymes had increased abundance in post-shock mesenteric lymph. In addition, a bioinformatics approach allowed for the identification of key pathways relating to defence and metabolic responses. A number of potentially important proteins were also identified as targets for future research in hemorrhagic shock: peroxiredoxins, 14-3-3 zeta/epsilon, calmodulin, cofilin, and profilin. Conclusions:?? This study not only provides the first comprehensive list of protein changes in the haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph, but also provides rational for future research.

AB  - Background:?? Colonoscopy is the gold standard for investigating pathology of the large bowel. Numerous factors influence the efficacy of bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel preparation can lead to missed pathology. Timing of preparation, timing of procedure and patient bowel habit may have an influence on the quality of the preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of cleansing of sodium picosulphate with different administration schedules and to evaluate whether patient's prior bowel patterns influenced quality of cleansing. Methods:?? 325 patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy to evaluate prior bowel habit and timing of preparation administration. The quality of preparation was then assessed during colonoscopy. Further patient factors evaluated included patient tolerance, compliance and adverse reactions to preparation. Procedural factors evaluated included quality of cleansing and circular muscle hypertrophy. Procedure total time, caecal intubation time and withdrawal times were also recorded. A 5-point scale was used to assess quality of cleansing. Results:?? The quality of cleansing for individual bowel segments was worse for afternoon procedures (p < 0.05 for all segments), and for patients with prior constipation (p < 0.05 for transverse and descending segments). No correlation was found between the quality indicators (total duration, caecal intubation time, withdrawal times), colon length, circular muscle hypertrophy or presence of diverticula for cleansing quality. Conclusion:?? The quality of cleansing is significantly improved when bowel preparation is taken the day prior to colonoscopy. In addition patients with prior constipation demonstrated poorer cleansing.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with a discussion of pathophysiology and implications of broad classes of congenital cardiac defects, including mixing lesions, shunts, and outflow obstruction lesions. Next, airway and ventilation management is presented, focusing on cardiorespiratory interactions, and the influence of lung volumes, intrathoracic pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure on cardiac physiology. Then, alternative modes of ventilation, and weaning from ventilation are discussed. The next section of the chapter presents a discussion of myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic monitoring, with an emphasis on assessment of cardiac output, surgical factors, effects of bypass, dysrhythmias, low preload/high afterload, and decreased myocardial contractility. The latter part of the chapter starts with a presentation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, postoperative complications, quality improvement, and mechanical support of the circulation. Finally, reviews of hemostasis, infection control, neurological complications and monitoring, fluid management and renal dysfunction, and nutritional and gastrointestinal complications are presented.
