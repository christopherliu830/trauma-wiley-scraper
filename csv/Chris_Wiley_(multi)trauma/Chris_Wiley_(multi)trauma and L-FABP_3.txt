AB  - Peptic ulcers (PU) are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They result in significant costs both to the patient and the health care system. Despite a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection, the incidence of bleeding PU has not reduced. Resuscitation of the patient with a bleeding PU remains the foundation of management. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has evolved from initially a diagnostic tool to now also being a therapeutic modality. The endoscopic stigmata of a visible vessel or active bleeding have been validated as indicators of a high risk of adverse outcomes. Multiple endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat bleeding PU with these stigmata. The most effective and commonly used are thermal contact therapy (heater probe or bipolar electrocoagulation) and endoscopic clipping. They are each used either as monotherapies or combined with adrenaline injection. These techniques have been shown to reduce the rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality. Early studies showed no benefit from the use of H2-receptor antagonists in patients with bleeding PU. In contrast, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given after endoscopic haemostatic therapy as a bolus and then a subsequent 72?hr infusion, have been shown to significantly reduce the rates of rebleeding,, surgery and mortality compared to placebo. In summary, endoscopic techniques combined with pharmacological treatment with PPIs significantly improve outcomes in patients with bleeding PU with high risk endoscopic stigmata. These methods are widely available and are essential in the optimal modern management of bleeding PU.

AB  - Purpose:?? Lesions of the submandibular gland represent a pleomorphically diverse group making benign and malignant lesions difficult to differentiate from each other. The current series aims to identify the roles of pre-operative cytology and imaging with subsequent histopathology in the management of these lesions. Methods:?? Between 1998 and 2008 fifty-four patients, of median age 54?years (range 25?94), were retrospectively identified. Fifty patients underwent fifty-two surgical procedures involving the submandibular gland. The utility of imaging and cytology was analysed, and the accuracy of cytology correlated with histopathology. Results:?? Pathologies of resected specimens included: sialadenitis; 17 (32%), pleomorphic adenoma; 9 (17%), calculi; 8 (15%), lymphoma; 5 (10%) squamous cell carcinoma; 2 (4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma; 1 (2%) and other; 10 (20%). Twenty-eight patients (52%) underwent fine needle aspiration cytology/core biopsies; of these 25 proceeded to surgery. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of fine needle aspiration cytology correlation with histology were 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4% respectively. Overall, the complication rate was 9.6%. Conclusion:?? This series demonstrates histological outcomes in patients specific to the submandibular salivary gland for which there are few comparative series in the literature. The trans-cervical surgical approach to submandibular gland pathology is a safe and effective method with minimal morbidity. Combining investigative modalities and cytology optimises the diagnosis and management of submandibular salivary gland lesions.

AB  - Introduction:?? Surgical teaching for clinical medical students is often undertaken across multiple clinical campuses. There are concerns heterogeneity of clinical experience may result in heterogeneity of learning outcome achievements. To avoid this, we have utilised standardised learning materials and tutorials across four hospital campuses. Methods:?? Using a feedback questionnaire, clinical experience from assigned hospitals was collected, including a question on influence of clinical experience on future career choice. This was analysed for inter-hospital differences. Clinical experience was also assessed by analysis of individual student portfolios. Students were administered a centralised standardised formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) during rotations. We analysed OSCE results from 2005 to 2008 for internal reliability and correlation with final written examination grades on a hospital-by-hospital basis. Results:?? Analysis of student feedback results and portfolios identified inter-hospital differences in clinical experience. Students indicated that clinical experiences had influence on decision to pursue future surgical careers. The OSCE had a good level of internal reliability (Cronbach's-alpha 0.62?0.75). No significant inter-hospital difference in OSCE results was found using one-way analysis of variance. OSCE results had strong correlations with final examination grades. Conclusions:?? Heterogeneity of clinical experience across different teaching settings does not translate into heterogeneity in achievement of learning outcomes when teaching materials are standardised. Consistent with previous published data, undergraduate clinical experience may influence future career choices.

AB  - Purpose:?? Stoma formation is a standard procedure in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the incidence seems to remain high. Here, we performed a prospective study on 137 patients with ileostomy or colostomy in order to identify potential risk factors. Methodology:?? 137 patients received stomas and were prospectively followed up four times after surgery. Early and late stoma complications, potential risk factors, and QOL were recorded using a modified SF-36 form. Results were subjected to statistical analysis and discussed with the view onto the current literature. Results:?? 72 patients received a colostomy and 65 patients an ileostomy. There was a complication rate of 55.5% (n = 76). 53 patients had early, 44 patients had late, and some had both early and late complications. Early complications occurred less than two months after surgery and included necrosis (16.1%), abscess (13.9%), and dehiscence (10.9%). Late complications included parastomal hernia (11.7%), chronic peristomal skin alteration (8.8%), stenosis (6.6%), prolaps (3.6%), and retraction 0.7%). 15 patients with late stoma complications needed surgery. High body mass index, emergency procedure, and omitted preoperative stoma marking were associated with significant higher risks for developing stoma complications. The availability of a stoma nurse greatly influenced outcome and QOL. Conclusion:?? Stoma complications are not rare and the surgeon should pay special attention to details of the technique. QOL of stoma patients is greatly influenced by specially trained stoma nurses. The identified risk factors have to be considered in order to reduce the incidence of stoma complications in the future.

AB  - Purpose:?? Anaesthesia delivery for colonoscopy within HNEAHS is either by an Anaesthetic driven propofol or an Endoscopist supplied sedation service (usually midazolam and fentanyl). The aim of this project is to compare patient satisfaction with respect to these two different modalities of anaesthetic delivery. Methodology:?? All patients undergoing colonoscopy between 1/9/2008 and 30/12/2008 in two endoscopy units (that utilised different sedation services) were surveyed with respect to their pain, recall and satisfaction regarding their anaesthetic delivery. Results:?? 263 out of a potential 735 patients consented prospectively to participation in the survey. Patients undergoing Anaesthetic driven propofol experienced less pain during colonoscopy than those who had Endoscopist supplied sedation (VAS 0.05/10 vs. 1.34/10, p < 0.0001). There was also significantly less recall during the procedure with propofol, and a significantly higher rate of satisfaction with the anaesthetic driven propofol service. There was no difference with respect to recall of events or pain following the procedure. Most importantly a higher proportion of patients who had Anaesthetic driven propofol would either be willing to undergo the procedure again when compared with patients having Endoscopist supplied sedation (99% vs. 95%, p < 0.05), or recommend it to others (100% vs. 92%, p < 0.005). Conclusion:?? An Anaesthetic driven propofol service for colonoscopy provides superior patient satisfaction when compared to Endoscopist supplied sedation.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Purpose:?? Early identification of the disease severity in acute pancreatitis and focused management based on Ranson's criteria has shown to improved patients? outcomes in many trials. We introduced Ranson's criteria at Ipswich Hospital in 2007 and compared the patients? outcome using historical controls. Methodology:?? A retrospective chart analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Ipswich Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Ranson's criteria and treatment protocols were introduced in January 2007 and data was collected prospectively. Data was assessed for the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, transfers to tertiary centres, morbidity and mortality. Results:?? 33 patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis in 2006 compared to 76 patients in 2007. Ranson's criteria were not formally assessed in any patient prior to 2007. However, 88% of patients had Ranson's criteria scored with strict adherence to the treatment protocol since 2007. 13 patients were scored as severe (greater than 3) in 2007 compared to none in 2006. 6% of patients developed pneumonia compared to 14% in 2007. Length of stay was 5.5?days in 2007 versus 4.87?days in 2006. Five ICU admissions and 4 transfers to tertiary centres occurred in 2007 compared to one transfer with no ICU admissions in 2006. There was no mortality in 2006 compared to 2% in 2007. Conclusion:?? Use of Ranson's criteria enables us to tailor our treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is a clinically useful tool and strict adherence leads to quick severity stratification, improved management and better use of health care resources.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Background:?? Presacral lesions often present late because of non-specific presenting symptoms and imaging findings that are difficult to interpret. We present the clinical scenario and review of the literature. Methods:?? A plexiform neurofibroma presenting as a presacral mass is described, with the difficulties in diagnosis and investigation explored. Results:?? CT and MRI are useful imaging modalities in the diagnosis of an undifferentiated presacral mass and certainly contribute to eliminating some differential diagnoses and exploring characteristics of the lesion, but ultimately the need for a histological diagnosis and surgical excision is highlighted. Conclusion:?? Presacral masses are difficult to diagnose, assess and treat. Adequate imaging and histological confirmation are essential in their treatment.

AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

Suture repairs of various types then dominated the treatment of hernia until the era of mesh repair championed by Stoppa and Lichtenstein. Surgeons feel that mesh repairs have revolutionized hernia surgery. Have the mesh repairs really made such a difference? There is evidence that all is not as it seems! Published recurrence figures don't seem to withstand close scrutiny. One of the trendy terms in herniology is the ?myo-pectineal orifice?, while many hernia specialists pay lip service to this concept, very few available hernia operations address this problem. The latest area of interest in the world of hernia surgery is the area of post-hernia groin pain, either neuralgic or non-neuralgic. There are studies showing an incidence of chronic groin pain following anterior repairs of 30% or more, and yet these operations are the most common hernia operations in the world! Keith in 1924 first postulated the concept of herniosis and was criticized. However there is a large volume of convincing evidence that herniae are manifestations of a metabolic disorder. They are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm and possibly with such diverse conditions as diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, and perhaps haemorrhoidal disease. Are we there yet? The answer is certainly no. However research into the metabolic problem of hernia development means that we are surely closer than we have ever been before.

AB  - Background:?? The rate of adverse events occurring in Australian hospitals is reported to be up to 12?17%. Adverse events need to be identified, reported and responded to if the system of health care is to be improved. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and nature of adverse events (unintentional harm arising as a result of healthcare) in general surgery in the Geelong Hospital. Method:?? A review was conducted of adverse events in the hospital incident reporting system (Riskman) and general surgical audits between 2004 and 2008. Adverse events were categorised according to severity (1?4) and the hospital response to these events noted. Results:?? There were 888 adverse events arising in 12801 general surgical admissions (6.93%). Their severity assessment codes (SAC) were: catastrophic (0.15%),; major (0.40%),; moderate (2.22%),; and minor (4.30). Some of the complications reported in surgical audits were also adverse events, the major ones being mortality (0.74%), unplanned reoperation (1.27%) and unplanned readmission (1.46%). Identification and tracking of these enabled implementation of system changes. These included a colorectal outcome reporting, PreVENT program (for DVT prophylaxis), review of colonoscopy initiatives, bedside tracheostomy care, and an electronic system to respond to pathology results (TR3). Conclusion:?? The adverse event rates occurring in general surgery at the Geelong Hospital were lower than those previously reported in the literature and may reflect a general improvement in the quality of care during the last decade if these rates are applicable to other hospitals. The hospital response to adverse events has resulted in significant sustainable system changes.

AB  - Aim: 1 Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Webster wound dehiscence (WD) risk scoring system when applied to a population beyond purely a veterans population as in Webster study. 2 Identify additional risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD that was not considered in the Webster study. Method:?? Bi-centre, retrospective case ? control analysis of preoperative and postoperative risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD over seven years (Jan 2000?Dec 2006). 103 patients with abdominal WD were compared to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients with midline laparotomies who were matched to year of operation. Patients were stratified according to the Webster WD risk scoring system and sensitivity and specificity analysis performed. Chi-square analysis was performed on risk factors that were not included in Webster WD Risk scoring model. Results:?? The overall WD rate is 2.8%. (103/3585 patients). Analysis of risk factors that were not considered by the Webster model within the WD group shows peritoneal sepsis (p = 0.04), prolonged ileus (p = 0.006) and current smoking status (p = 0.01) are significant factors associated with patients scoring highly for developing abdominal WD. Conclusions about the sensitivity and specificity of Webster WD risk scoring model can be drawn once control group data are collated. Conclusion:?? Webster WD risk scoring system appears to be a valid tool in identifying patients at high risk for WD. Peritoneal sepsis, prolonged ileus and smoking are associated with high risk of developing abdominal WD.

AB  - Purpose:?? Patients with Gallstone Pancreatitis (GP) have a high risk of choledocholithiasis. MRCP has been recommended by some as the investigation of choice to diagnose choledocholithiasis. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in GP. Methodology:?? Retrospective audit of all presentations of GP between Jan 2001?December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. Data were analysed using univariate analysis and chi-squared test. Results:?? There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis with 243 females and a mean age of 52?years. Overall, 95 cases of choledocholithiasis- as confirmed by ERCP/ Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) ? were diagnosed. The indications for MRCP in this study were heterogeneous. 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4?days of admission with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. ERCP/IOC confirmed 13/15 stones within a median of 2.5?days. MRCPs, however, missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. MRCP sensitivity was 62.0, specificity 97.9. The Positive Likelihood Ratio was 6.5, Negative Likelihood Ratio was 0.1. PPV was 86.7, NPV was 92.0. 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. Conclusion:?? Choledocholithiasis is common in GP. Selective MRCP is highly specific in GP but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.
