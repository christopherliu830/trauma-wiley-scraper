AB  - Purpose:?? To determine the outcome of patients who had ultrasound detected, but no evidence of clinical correlation. Methodology:?? In a single surgeon practice, all the patients referred by General Practitioners between Aug 2007 to June 2008 with an ultrasound suggesting inguinal hernia, but with no clinical correlation were included. All of them were managed non-surgically. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess the outcome in 16 out the 19 patients eligible for the study. Median follow-up was eight months. Results:?? Pain in the inguinal region was the predominant symptom at presentation. Seven patients had become pain free within two weeks of the initial consultation. The remaining 9 patients had residual pain; 5 patients noticed improvement, 1 patient felt no change and 2 patients had other diagnosis made for their symptoms. No patient chose to see another specialist or had an operation for the management of the initial presentation. Conclusion:?? Fourteen out of sixteen (87.5%) patients who had an ultrasound demonstrating the presence of an inguinal hernia, with no clinical correlation, had improvement or resolution of their pain. This study demonstrates the importance of non surgical management in patients with groin pain and ultrasound detected inguinal hernia but with no clinical correlation.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy has become the procedure of choice for acute appendicitis at our hospital. It provides ideal training in a variety of laparoscopic techniques. It is both safe for patients and good for the community by improving the skills of surgical trainees. Methods:?? We reviewed the prospective audit of one junior registrar's first 150 consecutive cases of laparoscopic appendicectomy, after supervision for the first five cases. Results:?? 150 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy over a period of 27?months. Ages ranged from 14 to 72 with a mean of 28. A standard 3 port technique was used, utilizing mostly suture loops, or occasionally linear staplers to tackle the appendix base. Of 124 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 44 (35%) had perforated, possibly reflecting delay in access to operating theatre in a busy public hospital. Despite this, only two post operative abscesses occurred, and both resolved after percutaneous drains. Hospital stay ranged from 2?7?days (Mean 2, Median 3.5?days). Senior surgical assistance was required in only two patients, once for laparoscopic repair of a serosal tear, and once for conversion for an inflammatory mass subsequently shown to be a carcinoma. Analysis of the cohort in three groups of fifty: early, mid, and late in the series demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both operative time and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the ideal training operation. After some initial supervision the trainees can perform surgery unsupervised and gain experience in a wide variety of surgical techniques. Clinical acumen and operative times improve with experience.

AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.

AB  - Background:?? The aim is to compare the outcomes of surgical management of large bowel emergencies. The traditional treatment of Hartmann's resection was compared to the new modalities of Colonic stenting for malignant obstruction and laparoscopic washout for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. Methods:?? This paper is a retrospective review of 112 consecutive large bowel emergencies presenting to The Tweed Hospital and John Flynn Private Hospital warranting surgical intervention during the 8?year period 2000?2008. Patients with obstruction from cancer and perforation from diverticulitis were included. Patients with volvulus, pseudo-obstruction, bleeding, stercoral ulceration and prolapse were excluded. Patients with non urgent colonic stenting were also excluded. Results:?? The patient groups were comparable for age, ASA and pathology after exclusions. 57 patients underwent a Hartmann's (obstruction 23, perforation 34) vs. 55 patients undergoing stent for obstruction 21, or washout for perforation 34. Significant differences were observed in the mortality rates, Hartmann's 11/57 (19%) vs. stent and washout 2/55 (37%). Also length of stay: Hartmann's 15?days vs. stent and washout 6?days. Hartmann's was required to salvage 2 failed stents and 6 failed washouts. In 16 of 26 washouts and 11 of 17 stents patients underwent delayed elective resection. Conclusion:?? Patient selection, technical expertise and long learning curve were all aspects that influenced the early results of stenting and washout. Hartmann's is no longer the preferred treatment option for left sided colonic emergencies.

AB  - Purpose:?? To investigate intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, in both rat intestinal ischaemia reperfusion injury, and in human necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Methodology:?? Plasma was collected from anaesthetized rats that underwent intestinal ischaemia reperfusion (IIR) injury and from control rats undergoing sham laparotomy. In a separate study, plasma and urine was collected from infants with NEC, and from control infants with non-abdominal diagnoses. iFABP was measured in urine and plasma using a commercially available ELISA. SMA was detected in plasma using a western blot technique. Results are median [IQR] and compared by Mann-Whitney test unless otherwise stated. Results:?? Animal model: Plasma iFABP was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with control group (IRI 32.4 [29.2] ng/ml vs. control 3.8 [3.3] ng/ml; p < 0.01). SMA became detectable in IRI plasma during reperfusion (p < 0.01 compared with pre-ischaemia, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test), but never in the control group. Human NEC Study:?? Urinary iFABP was significantly higher in the NEC group (2.1 [3.9] pg/nmol) compared to controls (1.1 [0.7] pg/nmol, p, < 0.05). Furthermore plasma and urinary iFABP correlated with extent of intestinal damage at laparotomy, and decreased with NEC resolution. SMA was detectable in the plasma of infants with multifocal or panintestinal NEC, but in neither focal nor non-operative disease. Conclusion:?? FABP and SMA are markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, and may offer clinically relevant information in the diagnosis and management of severe intestinal disease.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.
