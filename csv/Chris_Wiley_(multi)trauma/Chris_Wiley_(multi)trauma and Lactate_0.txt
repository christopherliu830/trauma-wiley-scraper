AB  - Objectives To investigate whether implementing a geriatric resuscitation protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement is associated with lower mortality through the early recognition of occult hypoperfusion (OH). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level I trauma center. Participants All hemodynamically stable individuals with blunt trauma aged 65 and older admitted to the Level I trauma center from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011 (n = 1,998). Measurements Mortality over time (according to quarter) was analyzed using an adjusted logarithmic regression model stratified according to the presence of OH. OH was defined as lactate of 2.5 mM or greater. Results Overall mortality was 3.9% (n = 78). Admission venous lactate was collected in 73.5% of participants, of whom 20.5% had OH (n = 301). In participants with OH, a significant decrease in mortality was observed over time (adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.66, P = .002). A smaller yet significant decrease in mortality rates in participants with normal perfusion status was also observed (adjusted R2 = 0.55, P = .01). Conclusion Early identification and treatment of OH in elderly adults with trauma using venous lactate-guided therapy coupled with early trauma surgeon involvement was associated with significantly lower mortality. A protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement should be followed to improve the care of elderly adults with trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

Physical examination findings included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hind limb paresis in a laterally recumbent patient. Radiographs, laboratory evaluation, and abdominocentesis revealed the presence of hemoperitoneum, blunt hepatic trauma, pneumothorax, and a small abdominal hernia. The ferret was treated with resuscitative fluids, thoracocentesis, abdominal counterpressure, and blood transfusion. This is the first case report of multi-systemic trauma in a ferret. The ferret made a complete recovery and was discharged to the referring veterinarian three days after presentation. (Vet. Emerg. Crit. Care, 10:13?18, 2000)

AB  - Abstract Objective To report summative data from the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry. Design Multi-institutional veterinary trauma registry data report. Setting VetCOT identified veterinary trauma centers (VTCs). Animals Dogs and cats with evidence of trauma presented to VTCs with data entered in the VetCOT registry September 1, 2013?March 31, 2017. Interventions VetCOT created a standardized data collection methodology for dog and cat trauma. Data were input to a web-based data capture system (REDCap) by data entry personnel trained in data software use and operational definitions of data variables. Data on demographics, trauma type (blunt vs penetrating), preadmission care, hospitalization and intensive care requirement, trauma severity assessment at presentation (eg, modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage score), key laboratory parameters, necessity for surgical intervention, and case outcome were collected. Summary descriptive data for each species are reported. Measurements and Main Results Twenty-nine VTCs in North America, Europe, and Australia contributed information from 17,335 dog and 3,425 cat trauma cases during the 42-month reporting period. A large majority of cases presented directly to the VTC after injury (80.4% dogs and 78.1% cats). Blunt trauma was the most common source for injury in cats (56.7%); penetrating trauma was the most common source for injury in dogs (52.3%). Note that 43.8% of dogs and 36.2% of cats were reported to have surgery performed. The proportion surviving to discharge was 92.0% (dogs) and 82.5% (cats). Conclusions The VetCOT registry proved to be a powerful resource for collection of a large dataset on trauma in dogs and cats seen at VTCs. While overall survival to discharge was quite high, further evaluation of data on subsets of injury types, patient assessment parameters, interventions, and associated outcome are warranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT A cat was presented in coma following severe trauma. The cat was alert and walking within 24 hours, after treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and mannitol. However, he subsequently began to show evidence of severe abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy revealed traumatic avulsion of the left limb of the pancreas. A sub-total pancreatectomy was performed and the cat recovered well. Two weeks post-operatively, the cat was re-presented with ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and upper motor neuron weakness in all four limbs. Radiographs revealed a fracture/luxation of C1?C2 which could not be adequately stabilized solely via a dorsal approach. A combined ventral and dorsal approach produced stabilization of the cervical spine which was clinically successful. Two months post-operatively there was stability but malalignment of C1?C2, and the cat appeared normal.

AB  - Background Admission lactate and lactate clearance are implemented for risk stratification in sepsis and trauma. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results regarding outcome and lactate are conflicting. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management trial in which 950 unconscious patents after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to a temperature intervention of 33°C or 36°C. Serial lactate samples during the first 36 hours were collected. Admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and the clearance of lactate within 12 hours after admission were analyzed and the association with 30-day mortality assessed. Results Samples from 877 patients were analyzed. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for death by day 30 for each mmol/L was 1.12 (1.08-1.16) for admission lactate, P < .01, 1.21 (1.12-1.31) for 12-hour lactate, P < .01, and 1.003 (1.00-1.01) for each percentage point increase in 12-hour lactate clearance, P = .03. Only admission lactate and 12-hour lactate levels remained significant after adjusting for known predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (0.61-0.69), P < .001, 0.61 (0.57-0.65), P < .001, and 0.53 (0.49-0.57), P = .15 for admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and 12-hour lactate clearance, respectively. Conclusions Admission lactate and 12-hour lactate values were independently associated with 30-day mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while 12-hour lactate clearance was not. The clinical value of lactate as the sole predictor of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is, however, limited.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - SUMMARY The use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma patients is an exciting application because hemorrhage and coagulopathy play prominent roles both in the syndrome of severe hemorrhagic shock and in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotal use of rFVIIa in non-hemophilic trauma patients extends back to 1999, and experience at individual institutions is now in the hundreds of cases. Efficacy in controlling traumatic coagulopathy approaches 80%, with long-term survival of about half of the patients treated. There have been few reports of inappropriate thrombotic events in trauma patients. A single prospective randomized study of rFVIIa in victims of hemorrhagic shock has been completed, with some favorable results. Further trials in hemorrhagic shock are underway in both European and American trauma centers, while a trial in TBI patients will begin within the coming year.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to investigate risk factors for early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and outcomes after liver transplantation (LT), focusing on peri-transplant lactate clearance. We reviewed patients who underwent deceased donor LTs between 2011 and 2014. Lactate levels were checked at reperfusion and at the time of intensive care unit admission. Early lactate clearance was defined as reduction rate of lactate between the times of reperfusion and immediately after LT. Patients were categorized into the normal and delayed clearance groups. We used propensity score matching (PSM) between these two groups to estimate an impact of lactate clearance on incidence of EAD and graft survival. A total of 256 recipients were eligible for this study. Cut-off value of lactate clearance to predict occurrence of EAD was determined at 0.2 mmol/L/h. After PSM, 120 patients in the normal clearance and 36 patients in the delayed clearance group were matched. Delayed lactate clearance was considered as an independent risk factor for EAD (Odds ratio 3.49, P = 0.002). The adjusted hazard of one-year graft loss was significantly increased in the delayed clearance group (hazard ratio 6.69, P = 0.001). In conclusion, peri-transplant delayed lactate clearance may be a strong predictor for EAD and poor liver graft outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Purdue University. Sources of funding:?Supported, in part, by a grant from the Indiana Horse Racing Commission. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Here we report the first mediated pain free microneedle-based biosensor array for the continuous and simultaneous monitoring of lactate and glucose in artificial interstitial fluid (ISF). The gold surface of the microneedles has been modified by electrodeposition of Au-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and successively by electropolymerization of the redox mediator, methylene blue (MB). Functionalization of the Au-MWCNTs/polyMB platform with the lactate oxidase (LOX) enzyme (working electrode 1) and with the FAD-Glucose dehydrogenase (FADGDH) enzyme (working electrode 2) enabled the continuous monitoring of lactate and glucose in the artificial ISF. The lactate biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity (797.4±38.1??A?cm?2?mM?1), a good linear range (10?100??M) with a detection limit of 3??M. The performance of the glucose biosensor were also good with a sensitivity of 405.2±24.1??A?cm?2?mM?1, a linear range between 0.05 and 5?mM and a detection limit of 7??M. The biosensor array was tested to detect the amount of lactate generated after 100?minutes of cycling exercise (12?mM) and of glucose after a normal meal for a healthy patient (10?mM). The results reveal that the new microneedles-based biosensor array seems to be a promising tool for the development of real-time wearable devices with a variety of sport medicine and clinical care applications.

PubMed and Cochrane database search: fibrinogen and (concentrate or trauma), not congenital, published between 2000 and 2012. Results? Six papers were identified. None were randomized controlled trials. The main conclusion of these papers was that administration of fibrinogen sometimes together with prothrombin complex concentrate might improve haemostasis in trauma patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Data regarding the effect of fibrinogen concentrate together with a more physiological resuscitation fluid, i.e. FFP, or as the only intervention in bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Conclusions? Evidence for the use of fibrinogen concentrate to trauma patients with massive bleeding is sparse, of poor quality and confined to patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of fibrinogen concentrate, as the only intervention, are urgently needed.

AB  - Our aim was to compare the respective values of base deficit and lactate in birth asphyxia. Methods: Base deficit and lactate levels were measured from radial artery blood samples taken at 30min of life in 115 term newborns suspected as having been asphyxiated during labour. Both base deficit and lactate levels were compared between patients who further developed moderate or severe encephalopathy and those who experienced no or only mild encephalopathy. Receiver operating characteristics curves and clinical values of both indicators were computed. Results: The correlation between base deficit and lactate was significant (r2= 0.51, p < 0.0001). Both indicators were significantly associated with neonatal outcome. Lactacidaemia lower than 5 mmol/l and/or base deficit level lower than 10 mEq/l were not followed by neurological complications. Plasma lactate concentration greater than 9 mmol/l was associated with moderate or severe encephalopathy with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 67%. Base deficit and lactate had similar clinical values. Conclusions: Base deficit and lactate measurements in arterial blood at 30 min of life are equally valuable in assessing the severity of birth asphyxia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To describe the ?Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products? trial (RePHILL) ? a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage. Background PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<90?mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age?<16?years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1?: 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250?mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of ≥20%/h over the first 2?hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.
