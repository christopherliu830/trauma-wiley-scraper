AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - Summary The study of stress, fear and anxiety was the major focus of research among the early neuroscientists interested in behaviour. This is not surprising because fear, anxiety and alarm play a fundamental role in survival. Thus, research investigating the phenomenology and neurobiology of anxiety, fear, startle, arousal, alarm, vigilance and alerting functions has been conducted for decades. This chapter provides an overview of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder. These anxiety disorders were selected because each of them has an extensive base of knowledge in two or more of the following areas: neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology or neuroimmunology, and neurophysiology.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In the last 10 years, there has been much attention on the role that dry cow management plays in mastitis epidemiology in many dairy herds in the UK. This forum summarises recent peer-reviewed evidence regarding specific items which have been shown to be important in the risk of acquiring new intra-mammary infections across the dry period in an attempt to shed light on those interventions which are likely to impact on the amount of disease in the next lactation. Finally, a group of veterinary advisors that have been trained to deliver the national DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan (http://www.mastitiscontrolplan.co.uk) and have a particular interest in mastitis control are asked for their experiences on practical changes that can be made following identification of dry period origin infection patterns in herds.

AB  - Abstract Polysialic acid (PSA) was investigated for its applicability as coating material for mammalian cell cultivation. PSA is involved in post-translational modification of the vertebrate neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). It is biocompatible and degradation-controlled. Thus, it becomes interesting for use as a coating and scaffold material for tissue engineering applications, especially for peripheral nerve regeneration. As a preliminary study of the use of PSA as scaffold material it was tested in its soluble form as coating material. The cytotoxicity was investigated and compared to another polysaccharide ?-glucan, to widely used coating substances (collagen I, poly-L-lysine, hyaluronic acid) and uncoated tissue culture plastic material. The interactions between the modified cell culture surface and the cells were investigated using a model liver cell line Hep-G2 and a neurobiological cell line PC-12. The PSA coating itself was analyzed by immunoanalysis. Viability of the cells was investigated by the MTT assay. The number and distribution of adhered cells were studied by cell nuclei staining. Furthermore, the differentiation status of the PC-12 cells was monitored, as well as glucose and lactate levels in the cell culture medium from the Hep-G2 cells. Comparable viability and similar numbers of attached cells were observed. Growth in cell clusters was observed for PSA, ?-glucan, and hyaluronic acid coated materials. In general, the results indicate that PSA is comparable to other well-established coating materials (e.g. collagen I, hyaluronic acid, and poly-L-lysine). Moreover, as a key substance in vertebrate development it offers interesting features for nerve regeneration, especially as an insoluble, modified scaffold material. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Successful milk ejection depends on a bolus release of oxytocin, which results from the synchronised burst firing of magnocellular oxytocin neurones in several hypothalamic nuclei. Despite extensive studies of the mechanism underlying the burst synchrony of oxytocin neurones in the same nucleus, brain regions controlling burst synchronisation among different nuclei remain elusive. We hypothesised that some structures in the ventroposterior hypothalamus may function as the major component of neural circuits controlling burst synchronisation of bilateral oxytocin neurones. To test this hypothesis, we recorded burst firing of bilateral oxytocin neurones in the two supraoptic nuclei after microsurgical disconnection of different hypothalamic regions in anaesthetised lactating rats. The results obtained showed that the interhemispheric section of the caudal part of the hypothalamus but not the rostral hypothalamus resulted in burst desynchronisation. The difference in burst onset time between paired bursts of bilateral oxytocin neurones was 129.2 ± 34.7 s, which is significantly (P < 0.01) longer than that of sham-lesioned controls (0.24 ± 0.02 s). Hypothalamic lesions leading to the desynchronisation involved the mammillary body, supramammillary nucleus and tuberomammillary nucleus in the ventroposterior hypothalamus. Consistently, electrolytic lesion of the median part of this mammillary body region also desynchronised the burst of bilateral oxytocin neurones and disrupted milk ejections. These results indicate that the mammillary body region is critically involved in the burst synchronisation of bilateral oxytocin neurones during suckling and possibly functions as the major component of a putative synchronisation centre.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are intrinsically heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that differ in their proliferation, multi-potency, and functional properties, which are commonly demonstrated by culturing hMSCs at different plating densities. The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium- or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD- or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs. Stem Cells 2015;33:3368?3381

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.
