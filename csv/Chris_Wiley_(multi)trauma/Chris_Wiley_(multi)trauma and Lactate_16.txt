AB  - Abstract Objective.? To evaluate the time of onset, overall efficacy, and safety of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for noncancer-related breakthrough pain (BTP) in opioid-tolerant adults over 12 weeks. Design.? A novel 12-week study that mimicked clinical practice with dose titration to effective dose, open-label treatment, and three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-crossover periods at weeks 4, 8, and 12. For each double-blind period, study patients received nine doses (FBT?=?6, placebo?=?3) in a randomized sequence. Setting.? Twenty-one study centers in the United States. Population. Opioid-tolerant adults with noncancer-related chronic pain and BTP. Outcome Measures.? The primary outcome was the sum of the pain intensity differences (PID) 5?60 minutes post dose (SPID60) during the final double-blind period. Secondary outcomes included pain relief (PR), meaningful PR, and proportion of episodes with a PID of ≥33% and ≥50%. Results.? Of 148 patients who entered the titration phase, 105 (71%) achieved a successful dose and 81 (55%) participated in all three assessment periods in the study. The final RCT assessment period results demonstrated continued efficacy of FBT vs placebo (P?<?0.05) for SPID60 (mean [SD]: 7.7 [6.2] vs 4.6 [4.7]). The average onset of PR began at 5 minutes, with meaningful PR by ≤10 minutes. The proportion of episodes with ≥33% improvement in PI was 7% with FBT vs 3% with placebo at 5 minutes and with ≥50% was 17% vs 10% at 15 minutes. All periods showed similar results. Adverse events and patient discontinuations were generally typical of clinical opioid use. Conclusions.? FBT showed continued clinically important analgesic effects and was generally well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the acid-base, fluid, and electrolytes. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a failure of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI manifests as polyuria with dilute urine in setting of hypertonic plasma. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase after fluid restriction is diagnostic confirmation. Treatment is aimed at replacing free water deficits and vasopressin, an ADH analogue. Acidosis is from the loss of bicarbonate and not the addition of an acid, a normal anion gap is expected. A widened anion gap would be expected from an etiology that caused the addition of an acid. The loss of bicarbonate causes a gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Because of this, normal gap metabolic acidosis has also been referenced as ?hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis?. The treatment in this setting would be to replace fluids and electrolytes.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin reportedly exerts beneficial effects to attenuate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Heatstroke resembles septic shock in many aspects. Thus, this study was performed on the anesthetized rats by using heat exposure to induce heatstroke-associated MODS. We evaluated the effect of melatonin, a versatile molecule synthesized in the pineal gland and in many organs, in heatstroke rats and showed that melatonin (0.2?5.0?mg/kg of body weight, i.v., immediately after the start of heat stress) significantly (i) attenuated hyperthermia, hypotension and hypothalamic ischemia and hypoxia, (ii) reduced plasma index of the toxic oxidizing radicals like nitric oxide metabolites and hydroxyl radicals, (iii) diminished plasma index of hepatic and renal dysfunction like creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, (iv) attenuated plasma systemic inflammation response molecules like soluble intercellular and lesion molecule-1, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6, (v) promoted plasma levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (vi) reduced an index of infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lung like myeloperoxidase activity, and (vii) promoted the survival time to fourfold compared with the heatstroke alone group. Thus, melatonin could be a novel agent for the treatment of heatstroke animals or patients in the early stage.

AB  - Objectives To compare serum concentrations of homocysteine in healthy dogs and those fitting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and to compare these values to commonly measured B-vitamins. Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Uterus transplantation has recently proved that infertility in women with uterine factor infertility can be cured. It is still an experimental procedure with numerous critical details remaining to be established, including tolerance to warm and cold ischemic insults. In preparation for human uterus transplantation trials, most teams use the sheep as a model system for research and team training, since the vasculature and the uterus is of similar size as in the human. We, therefore, aimed to develop an ex vivo sheep uterus reperfusion platform that mimics the reperfusion situation so that initial assessments and comparisons can be performed without the need for costly and labor-intensive in vivo transplantation experiments. Material and methods Isolated sheep uteri were perfused with the preservation solution IGL-1 and were then exposed to cold ischemia for either 4 (n = 6) or 48 hours (n = 7). Uteri were then reperfused for 48 hours under normothermic conditions with an oxygenated recirculating perfusate containing growth factors and synthetic oxygen carriers. Histological and biochemical analysis of the perfusate was conducted to assess reperfusion injury. Results Quantification of cell density indicated no significant edema in the myometrium or in the endometrium of uteri exposed to 4 hours cold ischemia and then a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion for 48 hours. Only the outer serosa layer and the inner columnar luminal epithelial cells were affected by the reperfusion. However, a much faster and severe reperfusion damage of all uterine layers were evident during the reperfusion experiment following 48 hours of cold ischemia. This was indicated by major accumulation of extracellular fluid, presence of apoptotic-labeled glandular epithelial layer and vascular endothelium. A significant accumulation of lactate was measured in the perfusate with a subsequent decrease in pH. Conclusions We developed a novel ex vivo sheep uterus model for prolonged perfusion. This model proved to be able to distinguish reperfusion injury-related differences associated to organ preservation. The experimental setup is a platform that can be used to conduct further studies on uterine ischemia- and reperfusion injury that may lead to improved human uterus transplantation protocols.

AB  - Background Reye's syndrome (RS) is a rare but severe acute life-threating disease characterized by encephalopathy and fatty liver damage. Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.
