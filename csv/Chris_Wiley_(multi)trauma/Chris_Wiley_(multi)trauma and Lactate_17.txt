AB  - Abstract A class of bioactive, stimuli-responsive co-joined interpenetrating networks of inherently conductive polymers and highly hydrated hydrogels are being developed for implantable biodevice interfaces and for electric field induced release of elutable drugs. A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700?mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm2 onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0?1.2?V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100?mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12:1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045?ÂµA?mM?1 cm?2. Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Aim The increased prevalence of non-operative management of splenic injuries contributes to the infrequent use of salvage procedures. Nevertheless, salvage procedures are sometimes required. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients. Methods This retrospective study included 27 splenic injury patients divided into two groups: those treated by salvage procedures (splenorrhaphy or partial resection) and those who underwent splenectomy. Our salvage procedure protocol was applied in the following situations: if hemodynamics were stable during laparotomy or bleeding was fully controlled by manual or incisional mobilization of the organ, when no more than two other organs required repair, and if no clinical coagulopathy existed. Results The splenic abbreviated injury scale, intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma requirements in 24?h were significantly lower in the salvage procedure group. There was no difference in the injury severity score, initial amount of bleeding, length of intensive care unit stay, or morbidity and mortality rates between the groups. Patients who underwent salvage procedures were managed without major complication, except one pseudoaneurysm case. Conclusion We confirmed the feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients, particularly for those with simple or lower grade injuries.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Abstract Background Cardiopulmonary arrest in paediatric patients often results in death or survival with severe brain injury. Therapeutic hypothermia, lowering of the core body temperature to 32 Â°C to 34 Â°C, may reduce injury to the brain in the period after the circulation has been restored. This therapy has been effective in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and adults after witnessed ventricular fibrillation cardiopulmonary arrest. The effect of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiopulmonary arrest in paediatric patients is unknown. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to December 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to December 2011); Ovid CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); Ovid BIOSIS (1923 to December 2011); and Web of Science (1945 to December 2011). We searched the trials registry databases for ongoing trials. We also contacted international experts in therapeutic hypothermia and paediatric critical care to locate further published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing therapeutic hypothermia with normothermia or standard care in children, aged 24 hours to 18 years, after paediatric cardiopulmonary arrest. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. Main results We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found four on-going randomized controlled trials which may be available for analysis in the future. We excluded 18 non-randomized studies. Of these 18 non-randomized studies, three compared therapeutic hypothermia with standard therapy and demonstrated no difference in mortality or the proportion of children with a good neurological outcome; a narrative report was presented.Â Â  Authors' conclusions Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed and the results of on-going trials will be assessed when available. Plain Language Summary Therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective therapy after cardiopulmonary arrest in children Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is uncommon however the numbers of children who survive are very low. Resulting brain injury in the survivors can be devastating for the child and family. Cooling the patient to a temperature of 32 Â°C to 34 Â°C, which is 3 Â°C to 4 Â°C below normal (therapeutic hypothermia), has previously been found to improve survival and reduce brain injury in newborn infants who were deprived of oxygen during birth, and also in adults following cardiopulmonary arrest. The causes of cardiopulmonary arrest are different in children than in adults, and asphyxia at birth is also different, so the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the proportion of children who survive or who have brain injury is unclear. We therefore conducted a Cochrane systematic review of the literature, searching medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) until December 2011 and contacting international experts for high quality published and unpublished evidence. Our searches failed to find any randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. However, we found four on-going trials which, when completed, may contribute to our review. At present there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of therapeutic hypothermia within a few hours after return of spontaneous blood flow following cardiopulmonary arrest in children. International resuscitation guidelines currently recommend that doctors consider using the therapy in infants and children although more research is needed to be sure this is the correct recommendation with the lack of treatment options other than supportive care in an intensive care unit that are available.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate initial tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2) in dogs presenting to an emergency room (ER) for acute hemorrhage. Design Prospective, observational study. Setting University veterinary teaching hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs with acute hemorrhage were enrolled between July 2009 and October 2010. Seventy-eight normal dogs from a previous observational study were included to represent healthy controls (?no shock?). Interventions Tissue oxygen saturation measurement was obtained at enrollment on dogs presented to the ER for acute hemorrhage. Baseline clinicopathologic (CBC, serum biochemical profile, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) and physiologic (plasma lactate concentration, venous blood gas, blood pressure, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry) data were recorded from all patients with hemorrhage. An ER clinician blinded to the StO2 value guided patient management. Patient survival to discharge from the hospital in the study group was recorded. Once data collection was complete, 3 emergency and critical care clinicians blinded to the StO2 data retrospectively classified patients into 1 of 4 shock categories (no shock, mild, moderate, or severe shock). Measurements and Main Results The historical group of healthy dogs had higher StO2 concentrations compared to the dogs classified with shock at all 3 levels (mild, moderate, and severe, P = 0.0006, <0.0001, and 0.0018, respectively); however, there was no statistical difference in StO2 between the levels of shock. A cut-off StO2 value of 87.6% identified a patient as having shock (area under the curve: 0.824, 95% confidence interval 0.749, 0.899). Conclusions Dogs with hemorrhagic shock have lower StO2 than a population of healthy dogs.

AB  - Abstract The development and organisation of the human brain start in the embryonic stage and is a highly complex orchestrated process. It depends on series of cellular mechanisms that are precisely regulated by multiple proteins, signalling pathways and non-protein-coding genes. A crucial process during cerebral cortex development is the migration of nascent neuronal cells to their appropriate positions and their associated differentiation into layer-specific neurons. Neuronal migration defects (NMD) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders including monogenetic disorders and residual syndromes due to damaging factors during prenatal development like infections, maternal diabetes mellitus or phenylketonuria, trauma, and drug use. Multifactorial causes are also possible. Classification into lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and neuronal heterotopia is based on the visible morphologic cortex anomalies. Characteristic clinical features of NMDs are severe psychomotor developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, and dysmorphisms. Neurometabolic disorders only form a small subgroup within the large group of NMDs. The prototypes are peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, peroxisomal Ã-oxidation defects and congenital disorders of O-glycosylation. The rapid evolution of biotechnology has resulted in an ongoing identification of metabolic and non-metabolic disease genes for NMDs. Nevertheless, we are far away from understanding the specific role of cortical genes and metabolites on spatial and temporal regulation of human cortex development and associated malformations. This limited understanding of the pathogenesis hinders the attempt for therapeutic approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of the most important cortical malformations and potential underlying neurometabolic disorders.

AB  - Objective This study sought to assess the long-term clinical benefits and predictors of survival of trans-catheter aortic valve closure in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients. Background LVADs have been shown to increase survival and quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, severe aortic insufficiency (AI) can develop in up to 50% of patients at 12 months resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Trans-catheter treatment of LVAD associated AI has emerged as a potential alternative to surgical treatment. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure using an Amplatzer Multi-Fenestrated Septal Occluder ?Cribriform? device to assess potential clinical and procedural factors associated with survival. Student's t-tests were used to compare baseline patient demographics and procedural characteristics, as well as patient outcomes immediately post procedure and at 6 months. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 10 patients (70% male, median age 59 years) were included. Technical success was accomplished in 100% of patients with a 6 month survival rate of 30% (3/10). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had a higher rate of pre-procedural clinical co-morbidities, an increased likelihood of right ventricular failure, and received larger occluder devices. Conclusions Trans-catheter aortic valve closure successfully treats late severe AI in LVAD patients, however, the presence or development of right heart failure portends a worse prognosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the factors involved in the development of right ventricular failure, and potential treatment, in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Wound healing is compromised by critical colonization and infection with bacteria. Hence, antimicrobial agents are used clinically to decrease the bacterial load and promote wound healing. Polihexanide (PHMB) has been found to be effective against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms and is increasingly utilized in rinsing solutions or in combination with wound dressings because of its good biocompatibility. In the present study, a co-culture of human keratinocytes and Staphylococcus aureus was established to serve as an in vitro model for infected wounds. Incubation of keratinocytes with increasing concentrations of S. aureus led to a dose-dependent decline of cell viability and proliferation. Lactate dehydrogenase release and interleukin-8 liberation were found to be elevated under these conditions. Polihexanide dose-dependently was able to protect keratinocytes from bacterial damage and re-establish normal human cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, a dressing consisting of biocellulose derived from Acetobacter xylinum with the addition of polihexanide was adept to safeguard keratinocytes against S. aureus. In conclusion, the co-culture system presented embodies a valuable tool as a model system for infected cells in a non-healing wound. Furthermore, the results obtained support the favorable function of polihexanide in the treatment of infected chronic wounds.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.
