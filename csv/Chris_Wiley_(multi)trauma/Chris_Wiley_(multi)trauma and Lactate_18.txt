AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - Only two cases of deliberate self-poisoning with metformin have been described in the literature. We report the management of three cases, all of which presented with severe lactic acidosis. Two cases had a fatal outcome. The options for treatment and previous cases reported in the literature are reviewed. Recommendations for the management of metformin overdose include early recognition, intensive support of the cardiovascular system, the correction of metabolic acidosis and the maintenance of body temperature. The use of venovenous haemofiltration against a non-lactate containing fluid may improve outcome when sodium bicarbonate alone fails to reverse severe systemic acidosis.

AB  - Background The medications produced from natural products are widely used as prophylactics for sickness induced by alcohol consumption. One such prophylactic is produced from the Reishi mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum. Because of the antioxidant properties of these preparations, we expect neuroprotective prophylactic effects of Reishi-based medications in alcohol-treated animals. Methods The Reishi (R) suspension was produced as water extract from Altaian mushrooms. Sprague?Dawley male rats were separated into the following 3 experimental groups: Group A + R received R (6 days per week) starting 1 week before alcohol exposure, and during the next 3 weeks, they received both R and alcohol; group A received alcohol; and group C received water. At the end of experiment, we determined the metabolic profile using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of the brain cortex and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver. Additionally, the blood cells were collected, and the serum biochemistry and liver histology were performed after euthanasia. Results Partial least squares discriminant analysis processing of the brain 1H MRS gave 2 axes, the Y1 axis positively correlated with the level of taurine and negatively correlated with the level of lactate, and the Y2 axis positively correlated with the content of GABA and glycine and negatively correlated with the sum of the excitatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and glutamine. The Y1 values reflecting the brain energetics for the A + R group exceeded the corresponding values for groups C and A. The maximal level of Y2 reflecting the prevalence of inhibitory metabolites in the brain was observed in the rats exposed to alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption did not cause significant pathological changes in the livers of the experimental animals. However, 20 days of alcohol consumption significantly increased the number of binuclear hepatocytes compared to the control. This effect was mitigated in the rats that received the Reishi extract. Conclusions Regular administration of the Reishi suspension improved the energy supply to the brain cortex and decreased the prevalence of inhibitory neurotransmitters that are characteristic of alcohol consumption. The alcohol-induced increase in liver proliferation was significantly suppressed by regular administration of the G. lucidum water suspension.

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to describe the underlying diseases, predisposing factors, clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with thromboembolic disease of non-cardiogenic origin in cats. Study Design: Necropsy-based retrospective study (1991?2002) Results: Forty-eight cats with thromboemboli that were not associated with significant structural heart disease were identified in a retrospective study using case records from the small animal necropsy service of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1991 to 2002. Thirty-five cats presented for non-specific signs such as lethargy and anorexia while others presented for signs such as paresis (10) or dyspnea (10) that were referable to the location of the thromboemboli. Thromboembolic disease was suspected clinically in 12 of 48 cats. In cases where a single predisposing factor could be identified, thromboemboli were associated with neoplastic (9), infectious (7) and inflammatory (3) disease. Thirteen cats had multiple predisposing factors and no obvious predisposing factor could be identified in 16 cats. The thromboemboli were found in the systemic arteries (12), systemic veins (9), both systemic arteries and veins (7), pulmonary vasculature (7) and in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation (13). Eleven cats either died at home, presented in respiratory or cardiac arrest, or arrested shortly after presentation to the emergency service. Two cats arrested later during hospitalization and the remainder were euthanized (35). No sex or breed disposition was found. There were no significant differences in serum biochemistries, coagulation profiles, lactate, Doppler blood pressure or rectal temperature when groups were compared by primary disorder. Cats with neoplasia as the underlying disorder were significantly older (median 13.5 years, p=0.04). Cats with infectious disease had statistically significant higher white blood cell counts (median 35,000/?l, p=0.03) and cats with inflammatory disease had significantly longer hospital stays (median 3 days, p=0.006). Conclusion: These results suggest that most cats with non-cardiac related thromboemboli often have multiple predisposing factors, non-specific signs and non-specific changes on laboratory parameters. More sensitive tests for hypercoagulability may aid in diagnosing thromboemboli in cats.

AB  - Abstract Cigarette smoke is known to be associated with the incidence of a variety of pulmonary diseases, and alveolar macrophages are a key player in the defense mechanism against inhalable toxicants. Herein, we have found that a hydrophilic fraction in smoke extracts from 3R4F reference cigarettes (CSE) contains high concentrations of volatile substances compared to cigarette smoke condensate (amphoteric fraction). We also identified the toxic mechanism of CSE using MH-S, a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line. CSE decreased cell viability accompanying increased lactate dehydrogenase release. Additionally, mitochondrial volume and the potential increased along with enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins and decreased adenosine triphosphate production. Similarly, CSE clearly induced increase of catalase activity and intracellular calcium concentration and decrease of endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome volume at the highest dose. More interestingly, damaged organelles accumulated in the cytosol, and CSE-containing particles specifically penetrated to mitochondria. Meanwhile, any significant change in autophagy related protein expression was not found in CSE-treated cells. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of CSE on secretion of inflammatory related cytokines and chemokines, considering the relationship between organelle damage and the disturbed immune response. Very importantly, we found that expression of innate and adaptive immunity related mediators is disrupted following CSE exposure. Taken together, we suggest that CSE may cause the accumulation of damaged organelles in the cytoplasm by impairing selective autophagic function. In addition, this accumulation is responsible for the inadequate ability of immune cells to repair the damage of lung tissue following exposure to CSE.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.
