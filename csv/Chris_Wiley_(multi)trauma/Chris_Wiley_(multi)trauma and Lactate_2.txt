AB  - Introduction There is relatively little information concerning physiological factors affecting show-jumping performance. This study examined the relationship between show-jumping exercise, muscle soreness, serum muscle enzyme activity and blood lactate concentration. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15 fence course (1.35?1.45?m) once on day one and twice on day two; on day three the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Veterinary and physiotherapy assessments of muscle soreness were performed daily before and after exercise. An international coach graded jumping technique. Blood was obtained before and on two occasions after jumping (1 minute, two hours) for measurement of serum CK and AST, and blood lactate concentration. Data were analysed using regression procedures or Spearman correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05). Results Blood lactate significantly increased one minute after jumping on all three days (P?=?0.003 for all). When two rounds were jumped, lactate was significantly lower after the second round compared to the first (P?=?0.006, P?=?0.014). There was a positive correlation between blood lactate one minute after jumping and number of faults scored daily and overall (R2?=?0.61; P<0.01), decreased jumping technique grade (R2?=?0.69; P<0.01) and increased gluteal muscle soreness on day two (r?=?0.75; P?=?0.012). Plasma CK activity one minute, and 2 hours after jumping was significantly higher than before jumping on all days (P<0.01). Conclusions Horses with higher blood lactate concentrations after jumping demonstrated decreased jumping performance and were more likely to display muscle soreness.

AB  - Key points The physiological metabolite, lactate and the two-pore domain leak potassium channel, TREK1 are known neuroprotectants against cerebral ischaemia. However, it is not known whether lactate interacts with TREK1 channel to provide neuroprotection. In this study we show that lactate increases TREK1 channel activity and hyperpolarizes CA1 stratum radiatum astrocytes in hippocampal slices. Lactate increases open probability and decreases longer close time of the human (h)TREK1 channel in a concentration dependent manner. Lactate interacts with histidine 328 (H328) in the carboxy terminal domain of hTREK1 channel to decrease its dwell time in the longer closed state. This interaction was dependent on the charge on H328. Lactate-insensitive mutant H328A hTREK1 showed pH sensitivity similar to wild-type hTREK1, indicating that the effect of lactate on hTREK1 is independent of pH change. Abstract A rise in lactate concentration and the leak potassium channel TREK1 have been independently associated with cerebral ischaemia. Recent literature suggests lactate to be neuroprotective and TREK1 knockout mice show an increased sensitivity to brain and spinal cord ischaemia; however, the connecting link between the two is missing. Therefore we hypothesized that lactate might interact with TREK1 channels. In the present study, we show that lactate at ischaemic concentrations (15?30 mm) at pH 7.4 increases TREK1 current in CA1 stratum radiatum astrocytes and causes membrane hyperpolarization. We confirm the intracellular action of lactate on TREK1 in hippocampal slices using monocarboxylate transporter blockers and at single channel level in cell-free inside-out membrane patches. The intracellular effect of lactate on TREK1 is specific since other monocarboxylates such as pyruvate and acetate at pH 7.4 failed to increase TREK1 current. Deletion and point mutation experiments suggest that lactate decreases the longer close dwell time incrementally with increase in lactate concentration by interacting with the histidine residue at position 328 (H328) in the carboxy terminal domain of the TREK1 channel. The interaction of lactate with H328 is dependent on the charge on the histidine residue since isosteric mutation of H328 to glutamine did not show an increase in TREK1 channel activity with lactate. This is the first demonstration of a direct effect of lactate on ion channel activity. The action of lactate on the TREK1 channel signifies a separate neuroprotective mechanism in ischaemia since it was found to be independent of the effect of acidic pH on channel activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The clinical spectrum of electrical injury ranges from the absence of any external physical signs to severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain injury accompanying an electrical trauma. In this report, a case study and discussion are presented on the management and coordination of postacute care of an electrical trauma survivor. Expertise and a multi-disciplinary team are essential to cohesive patient care. Patient monitoring for progressive changes and prompt intervention are needed to address the potential difficulties experienced by trauma survivors as they rehabilitate to return to their work and their activities of daily living.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Introduction In an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) for Icelandic horses, gaits are scored from 5?10 and there is an option for judges to add standardized comments on the gaits. The aim of this study was to test if comments given on pace were related to horses? plasma lactate concentration (Lac) post BEFT, with the hypothesis that some of the comments would be related to Lac. Methods Data was collected from 157 horses (age 4?11 years) at a BEFT in Iceland in 2011. Venous blood samples were obtained after exercise and lactate concentration determined. Judges? comments were obtained from Worldfengur. The comments that could be given were: ?good speed?, ?clear beat?, ?sure?, ?big movements?, ?good suspension?, ?long strides? (positive comments); and ?lack of speed?, ?unsure?, ?four-beat?, ?short strides?, ?changing gait? and ?jumping out of gait? (negative comments). Results were separated into two groups (within each comment); horses/pace with the comment and horses/pace without the comment. Data were analysed via ANOVA (Proc GLM, SAS) including sex, age group, comment, average speed and distance (P<0.05). Results Lac was higher when pace had comments ?good speed? and ?sure? than when no comment was given (23.6?±?1.2 vs. 17.9?±?0.5, P<0.001; and 20.2?±?0.9 vs. 18.1?±?0.6, P<0.05) and was lower when pace had comments ?lack of speed? and ?unsure? (16.8?±?1.0 vs. 19.2?±?0.6; and 16.2?±?1.0 vs. 19.3?±?0.5, P<0.05). No other significant effects on Lac were observed. Conclusions Horses with pace subjectively judged as fast and ?sure? had higher blood lactate concentration indicating that successful pace is more anaerobic than less successful pace.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian sport horse (BH) was specifically developed for jumping competition. Monocarboxylate transporters are key regulators of cell pH and therefore facilitate co-transport of protons and lactate. Lactate transport in red blood cells (RBCs) is bimodal (high [HT] and low transport [LT]) and is related to CD147 levels. This study aimed to quantify MCT1 and CD147 protein levels in BH after an incremental jumping test (IJT). Methods Sixteen horses were distributed into two groups: low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.00?m, and high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.20?m. The IJT consisted of three steps, each with forty jumps at increasing heights (0.40, 0.60, and 0.80?m). Blood samples were collected before and after the IJT. The YSI 2300 method was used to determine plasma lactate concentration [Lac]p. RBC membranes were purified, and MCT1 and CD147 levels were measured by Western blotting. A Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation (P<0.05) were employed. Results The HL group displayed lower [Lac]p, indicating prevalence of the aerobic pathway in this group. The results showed no difference in the expression of the transporters between times or groups and a positive correlation (r?=?0.67, P<0.0001) between MCT1 and CD147. In both groups [Lac]p didn't correlate with the amount of MCT1 or CD147. Most of the horses appeared to have high lactate transport activity. The CD147/MCT1 ratios for LL and HL were equal. Conclusions BH showed no difference in MCT1 and CD147 expression between conditioning levels.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Introduction Chuckwagon racing involves 4 Thoroughbred horses pulling a 600?kg wagon through a figure-8 pattern and running a 1000?m dash. Horses can race four days in a row and there are concerns regarding the contribution of cumulative racing to electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden death, and its impact on recovery. The objective was to investigate the effects of cumulative racing on plasma electrolytes, lactate and prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods 148 horses (9.0?±?2.7 years) from 13 teams were monitored for heart rate and ECG activity on racing days 1 and 2. Differences in plasma electrolytes, pH and lactate (pre-vs. post-exercise and between days) were analysed (paired t-test). Associations between electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing and recovery (Pearson correlation) were examined. Results 377 ECGs (82 incomplete due to lost electrode) and 750 plasma samples (374 pre, 376 post) were analysed. 4235 arrhythmic events (21.6% warm-up, 37.6% racing, 20.4% recovery) were recorded and were not different between days 1 and 2. They mainly comprised supraventricular premature contractions during warm-up and racing (48% and 81.4% respectively) and ventricular premature contractions during recovery (29.2%). A significant association was found between post-exercise electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing (P<0.001, r?=?0.17). Consecutive racing significantly increased post-exercise lactate on day 2 (P<0.001). Pre-exercise pH and electrolytes were significantly different on day 2. Conclusions An association exists between post-exercise electrolytes and occurrence of arrhythmias during consecutive racing, however it is of little clinical significance. Ventricular arrhythmias are as prevalent in chuckwagon horses as in other disciplines. Overall, repetitive racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Because of its intrinsic permissive properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability, we chose to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of a chitosan-based biopolymer. The biomaterial toxicity was measured through in vitro test based on fibroblast cell survival on thermogelling chitosan lactate hydrogel substrate and then polymer was implanted into a C2 hemisection of the rat spinal cord. Animals were randomized into three experimental groups (Control, Lesion and Lesion?+?Hydrogel) and functional tests (ladder walking and forelimb grip strength tests, respiratory assessment by whole-body plethysmography measurements) were used, once a week during 10 weeks, to evaluate post-traumatic recoveries. Then, electrophysiological examinations (reflexivity of the sub-lesional region, ventilatory adjustments to muscle fatigue known to elicit the muscle metaboreflex and phrenic nerve recordings during normoxia and temporary hypoxia) were performed. In vitro results indicated that the chitosan matrix is a non-toxic biomaterial that allowed fibroblast survival. Furthermore, implanted animals showed improvements of their ladder walking scores from the 4th week post-implantation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings indicated that animals receiving the chitosan matrix exhibited recovery of the H-reflex rate sensitive depression, the ventilatory response to repetitive muscle stimulation and an increase of the phrenic nerve activity to asphyxia compared to lesioned and nonimplanted animals. This study indicates that hydrogel based on chitosan constitute a promising therapeutic approach to repair damaged spinal cord or may be used as an adjuvant with other treatments to enhance functional recovery after a central nervous system damage. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Massive transfusion is a common consequence of major haemorrhage in the trauma patient. It affects the entire process of care, both for the clinicians involved in the patient's care and for the blood bank, given the consequences and complications of transfusions. This article will highlight the pathophysiology leading to the need for massive transfusion and provide some modern surgical approaches to decrease the transfusion requirement and lessen its effect on the individual patient. Practical suggestions for a massive transfusion protocol, based on our experience and the available literature will be provided. Finally the article will examine the complications of a massive transfusion and outline the steps in the prevention and management of these complications.

AB  - In a single-blind study, 12 men (mean age 63 years) with senile dementia were given nafronyl in a dosage of 100 mg eight times daily for a week, followed by 100 mg four times daily for 12 weeks. Rigorous clinical, laboratory and psychometric assessments revealed no toxicity and no significant effects on vital functions. In the cerebrospinal fluid, the ratio of lactate to pyruvate decreased?a finding consistent with an increase in the aerobic metabolism of glucose.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - 1. The blood flow to the liver in fetuses near to term, in newborn and in adult sheep was measured in vivo by the Fick principle using radionuclide-labelled plastic microspheres and timed withdrawal of reference organ blood samples. 2. There is a rapid flow of blood, 410.1 +/- 41.8 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1, mean +/- S.E.M., to the liver in the fetus. Immediately after birth the blood flow is significantly less (172.5 +/- 27.5 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1), reflecting the loss of the umbilical venous return to the liver following delivery and separation from the placenta. Arterial blood flow to the liver per unit weight of liver was small in the fetus (9.5 +/- 1.2 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1), significantly greater in the immediate newborn (27.9 +/- 7.9 ml min-1 (100 g)-1) but appeared to decline with age after birth to 12.2 +/- 6.6 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 in lambs at 16 weeks of age. Portal blood flow to the liver, on a weight basis, changed little with age being 126 +/- 20.9 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1 in the fetus, 144.7 +/- 21.1 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1 in the immediate newborn and 203.2 +/- 27.8 ml min-1 (100 g liver)-1 in the adult. 3. Oxygen consumption and glucose and lactate fluxes across the sheep liver were determined from 132 days of gestation into adulthood. 4. The oxygen consumption by the fetal liver was 0.11 +/- 0.02 mmol min-1 (100 g)-1 which represents about 6% of the total fetal oxygen metabolism. Immediately after birth there was an apparent increase in liver oxygen consumption but the wide variation in the values recorded means that the change is not statistically significant. There were no significant changes in liver oxygen consumption with age after delivery, oxygen consumption by the adult liver was 0.16 +/- 0.05 mmol min-1 (100 g)-1. 5. The liver at all ages studied consumed lactate. Lactate consumption was particularly high in the fetus (0.13 +/- 0.04 mmol min-1 (100 g)-1 and could account for three times the oxygen consumed by the fetal liver, but the fate of this lactate is not yet known. 6. In the fetus the liver is in approximately zero glucose balance; in contrast postnatal animals release glucose from the liver at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.
