AB  - Postoperative liver failure is a rare complication after living donor liver resection. This is a case report of a 22-year-old healthy donor who was rescued with liver transplantation 11 days after right hemihepatectomy. Nine months later the patient is alive, and has fully recovered from his multiple organ failure. According to a review of the literature, there are four additional living liver donors, who received a liver transplant. Our own patient is the only survivor, so far. This case demonstrates that even in supposedly healthy living donors postoperative complications cannot be completely prevented. Although liver failure is rare in these patients, timely transplantation may need to be considered as the only life-saving treatment.

AB  - Summary Burns and dog-bite wounds can be superficial or extensive, involving muscle, bone, and vital organs. Bullet wounds may penetrate deeper tissues causing injury far from the point of entry. Burns that cover a large surface area result in substantial losses of fluids and electrolytes. Medications applied topically to burns should be easy to apply and should not interfere with healing. Horses that have incurred a bullet wound may require antimicrobial therapy, due to the penetration of a viscus, or a synovial structure. The bullet injures tissues directly in its path, and concussive forces injure tissue adjacent to the bullet's path. Dog-bite wounds are heavily contaminated and characterized by the presence of crushed, necrotic tissue. Damage to tissue caused by a bullet, a bite, or a burn progresses after injury, necessitating continuous re-evaluation of the wound.

AB  - Abstract Bioactive glasses (BAGs) are being investigated for the repair and reconstruction of bone defects, as they exhibit osteoconductive and osteostimulatory potential. However, successful bone regeneration requires also the neovascularization of the construct which is, among other factors, guided by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, BAG S53P4 (53% SiO2, 23% Na2O, 20% CaO, 4% P2O5) is investigated in relation to VEGF-release and response of fibroblast cells. Human CD-18CO fibroblasts were cultivated in contact with different granules of different sizes (0.5?0.8 mm, 1.0?2.0 mm, and 2.0?3.15 mm) and at different concentrations (0?1 wt/vol % of BAG) for 72 h. The analysis of morphology revealed no toxic effect for all granule sizes and concentrations. Compared with the reference, lactate dehydrogenase-activity of CCD-18CO cells increased in contact with BAG samples. The VEGF release from CCD-18CO fibroblasts cultured on different granule sizes and at different concentrations after 72 h of incubation was quantified. It was found that particles of 0.5?0.8 mm and 1.0?2.0 mm in size enhanced VEGF release, whereas BAG particle sizes of 2.0?3.15 mm led to inhibition of VEGF release. The results are relevant to understand the influence of the particle size and concentration of BAG S53P4 on VEGF expression and neovascularization. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Following subarachnoid haemorrhage the most significant complication is sustained cerebral vascular contraction (vasospasm), which may result in terminal brain damage from cerebral infarction. Despite this, the biochemical cause of vasospasm remains poorly understood. In this study, the global high-concentration metabolite composition of CSF has been correlated with patient outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage using multivariate statistics and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In total, 16 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) were compared with 16 control patients who required a procedure where CSF was obtained but did not have aSAH. Multivariate statistics readily distinguished the aSAH group from the heterogeneous control group, even when only those controls with blood contamination in the CSF were used. Using principal components analysis and orthogonal signal correction, vasospasm was correlated to the concentrations of lactate, glucose and glutamine. These pattern recognition models of the NMR data also predicted Glasgow Coma Score (54% within ±?1 of the actual score on a scale of 1?15 for the whole patient group), Hunt and Hess SAH severity score (88% within ±?1 of the actual score on a scale of 1?5 for the aSAH group) and cognitive outcome scores (78% within ±?3 of the actual score on a 100% scale for the whole patient group). Thus, the approach allowed the prediction of outcome as well as confirming the presence of aSAH. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a robust, non-invasive means of defining aspects of human neurochemistry. After more than two decades, it is clear that in addition to its scientific interest, MRS has diagnostic value in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic outcome, dementia diagnosis and prognosis, multiple sclerosis, infections, trauma, development, stroke, perinatal ischemia, xenobiotics and inborn errors (as determined from a meta-analysis included in this paper). However, in many healthcare systems, a new radiological technique requires evidence-based medicine (EBM) before it is recommended for reimbursement. Much of the reason why MRS is thought to be non-reimbursable in the USA is due to recent announcements that this 15-year-old technique is still considered ?investigational? by these EBM assessments. An analysis is presented of the technology assessments that brought about this situation. Based on the conclusions of the EBM assessments, strategies are suggested that involve all entities responsible for spectroscopy including the scientists' role in ensuring the future for clinical spectroscopy.

AB  - The term ?complex emergency? was coined by the UN to imply a phenomenon characterized by a combination of causes (conflicts, war, famine, displacement) requiring a combination of responses (military, peacekeeping, relief ). The ?complexity? refers to the ?multi?mandate? nature of the response as well as the multi?causal nature of the emergency. Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the UN humanitarian assistance programme in Sudan, has been described as history?s largest humanitarian intervention in an active civil war, providing a model for the international community in what can be achieved in complex political emergencies. The paper reviews how humanitarian aid was used in Sudan, and the potential for that usage contributing to development. The political dimension of decisions taken and implemented by donors, the United Nations and non?governmental organizations is explored.

AB  - Pelvic exsanguination is usually fatal unless the patient is injured in a city or region that has a sophisticated trauma care system. Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ?? Delayed definitive reconstruction when physiologically stable

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the principles and physics of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and its current use in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources: Research for this manuscript included current human and veterinary literature. Human-based studies: Human studies of BIA and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) have resulted in a considerable amount of controversy about the capability of BIA and MFBIA to accurately assess exact fluid volume and distribution. The recent emphasis on point-of-care monitoring has resulted in the use of BIA and MFBIA to evaluate the rapid changes in fluid distribution that can occur with trauma and various disease states. Veterinary-based studies: The use of BIA and MFBIA has been limited in veterinary medicine. However, studies in domestic and laboratory animals have shown good correlation with the isotope dilution method. The effectiveness of BIA/MFBIA in monitoring the critically ill veterinary patient has not yet been evaluated. Conclusion: BIA and MFBIA have been used to evaluate a variety of biological parameters such as nutritional status, cardiac output, and intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Recent studies using BIA and MFBIA to evaluate fluid compartmentalization and shifts in critically ill human patients have shown promising results. BIA and MFBIA provide immediate results that may aid in the assessment of a patient's clinical progress and response to therapy.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.
