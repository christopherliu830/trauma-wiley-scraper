AB  - Pelvic exsanguination is usually fatal unless the patient is injured in a city or region that has a sophisticated trauma care system. Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ?? Delayed definitive reconstruction when physiologically stable

AB  - Summary As an acute intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation/embolus injures the spinal cord to some degree, and may present as a traumatic incident, approach to diagnosis and management will be presented as an injury. Patients with spinal cord and vertebral injury or disease can exhibit myriad pain levels, in addition to frustration and anxiety. This anxiety and frustration can compound the pain level and pain scoring of a patient and should be taken into consideration. Before offering anti-anxiolytic medications, consider pain level and provide appropriate analgesia. Anesthesia-induced relaxation of the muscles that may be tensed to protect the injured area and inattentive handling of the patient during positioning for intubation, movement on/off gurneys, positioning for imaging/procedures can worsen the patient's pain and may even exacerbate the injury. Pathology may be due to ischemia, inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tumours or extradural compression resulting in persistent or intermittent somatic or visceral neuropathic pain.

AB  - Key Points Vascular dysfunction at the level of the brachial artery after transradial cardiac catheterization appears transient and resolves within a week Chemo-toxicity from procedural cocktails in addition to catheter-mediated barotrauma directly to the brachial artery or indirectly from radial trauma may play a role in its etiology. Further work is needed to better define the causes of vascular damage from the transradial procedures to develop safer techniques for the future.

AB  - Summary Chemical immobilization of wild animals is a form of veterinary anesthesia conducted under difficult circumstances. The ideal capture site should allow good visualization of the animal during the induction period. Hyperthermia is a serious complication that can be difficult to treat in field situations. Equipment for airway support, including appropriately sized endotracheal tubes and a bag valve mask to enable mechanical ventilation should be included in an emergency kit. Physical capture, such as net gunning, rocket nets, drive nets, traps, and snares, can induce greater stress than chemical immobilization. Remote drug delivery systems have the potential to produce serious injury and death, if used inappropriately. The major sources of injury arise from dart impact trauma, high velocity injection of dart contents, and inaccurate dart placement. Careful planning, close monitoring, and early intervention are essential for preventing morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract The paper overviews various methods that are used for the analysis of output signals generated by enzyme-based logic systems. The considered methods include optical techniques (optical absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance), electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, potentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, conductivity measurements, use of field effect transistor devices, pH measurements), and various mechanoelectronic methods (using atomic force microscope, quartz crystal microbalance). Although each of the methods is well known for various bioanalytical applications, their use in combination with the biomolecular logic systems is rather new and sometimes not trivial. Many of the discussed methods have been combined with the use of signal-responsive materials to transduce and amplify biomolecular signals generated by the logic operations. Interfacing of biocomputing logic systems with electronics and ?smart? signal-responsive materials allows logic operations be extended to actuation functions; for example, stimulating molecular release and switchable features of bioelectronic devices, such as biofuel cells. The purpose of this review article is to emphasize the broad variability of the bioanalytical systems applied for signal transduction in biocomputing processes. All bioanalytical systems discussed in the article are exemplified with specific logic gates and multi-gate networks realized with enzyme-based biocatalytic cascades.

AB  - Abstract We reviewed retrospectively the data for adult patients with bacterial meningitis over a period of 10.5 years in our hospital. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the 21 cases (52 strains) of mixed infection were analyzed. Two hundred and fifteen cases of single pathogen adult bacterial meningitis (ABM) were also included for comparison. Post-neurosurgical type of ABM was presented in 86% of the mixed infection group. Brain abscess was found in three patients. Fourteen patients survived and seven cases died. The analysis showed a statistical significance for the mixed infection group having a higher rate of nosocomially-acquired, post-neurosurgical condition, hydrocephalus, and lower level of cerebrospinal fluid white cell count, protein and lactate than the single pathogen group. Logistic regression analysis showed the independent factor of ?hydrocephalus? (p?=?0.002). Presence of hydrocephalus is a significant neuroimaging feature when compared with the single pathogen group. As compared with the previous study results of mixed infection in ABM, the present study showed a change of pathogens implicated of increasing Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. infections, and an emergence of anaerobic pathogens. All these changes deserve special attention because of the need for an appropriate choice of empirical antibiotics and choice of culture method.

AB  - Summary Background Nutraceuticals are often used in the management of equine osteoarthritis, but scientific evidence of their efficacy is lacking. Objectives To study the preventive effects of two new nutraceuticals after the experimental induction of synovitis in comparison with positive and negative control treatments. Study design Blinded, controlled, randomised experiment. Methods Twenty-four healthy Standardbred horses were randomly allocated to supplement AT (multi-ingredient, 28 days), supplement HP (collagen hydrolysate, 60 days), meloxicam (4 days) or placebo (60 days). Synovitis was induced in the right intercarpal joint by intra-articular injection of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli while treatments were continued. Blood and synovial fluid were sampled before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Synovial fluid samples were analysed for total nucleated cell count (TNCC), total protein (TP) and selected biomarkers (prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], interleukin-6 [IL-6], glycosaminoglycans [GAGs], type II collagen synthesis [CPII], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]). Lameness was scored by visual examination and pressure plate analysis immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Clinical examinations were performed before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, at 2, 4 and 6 h post-injection, and then twice per day during the test period. Results Before treatment and intra-articular challenge, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups for any of the parameters. After intra-articular challenge, the placebo group showed significantly higher synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with the meloxicam group, although the model did not induce a relevant amount of lameness. Both nutraceuticals resulted in significantly lower synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with placebo. No statistical differences in IL-6, GAGs, CPII or MMPs were observed among treatment groups. No adverse effects were observed. Main limitations Despite evidence of synovitis, lameness was too mild to detect. Conclusions The preventive administration of these nutraceuticals showed anti-inflammatory effects in this validated synovitis model. Therefore, further studies of their clinical applicability are warranted.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is involved in the regulation of many essential processes, especially metabolic homeostasis. SIRT6 knockout mice undergo premature aging and die at age ~4 weeks. Severe glycometabolic disorders have been found in SIRT6 knockout mice, and whether a dietary intervention can rescue SIRT6 knockout mice remains unknown. In our study, we found that at the same calorie intake, a high-fat diet dramatically increased the lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice to 26 weeks (males) and 37 weeks (females), reversed multi-organ atrophy, and reduced body weight, hypoglycemia, and premature aging. Furthermore, the high-fat diet partially but significantly normalized the global gene expression profile in SIRT6 knockout mice. Regarding the mechanism, excessive glucose uptake and glycolysis induced by the SIRT6 deficiency were attenuated in skeletal muscle through inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling by the high-fat diet. Similarly, fatty acids but not ketone bodies inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis, and senescence in SIRT6 knockout fibroblasts, whereas PI3K inhibition antagonized the effects of a high-fatty-acid medium in vitro. Overall, the high-fat diet dramatically reverses numerous consequences of SIRT6 deficiency through modulation of insulin and IGF1 signaling, providing a new basis for elucidation of SIRT6 and fatty-acid functions and supporting novel therapeutic approaches against metabolic disorders and aging-related diseases.

AB  - Introduction:? The pathomechanisms of bovine laminitis are still poorly understood. Isolated perfused organ models are promising tools to study the biological mechanisms that lie behind diseases. They are preferable for ethical and financial reasons but also for experimental necessities. Aims:? To develop an isolated haemoperfused distal cow limb model, basing on an already existing porcine limb model used in experiments studying the effects of bioactive molecules. Methods:? Isolated limbs and blood were obtained from routinely slaughtered cows and subsequently perfused in the laboratory of a biotech company (Vitro-Tec, Berlin) with expertise in organ perfusion. A standard perfusion apparatus enables perfusion for up to six hours under close to physiological conditions. Perfusion pressure and flow were calculated based on values available for horses and pigs. The oxygen saturation was kept at 100% and the pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Glucose was added as nutrient. The lactate concentration was measured as a parameter for oxygen supply and free haemoglobin as an indicator for haemolysis. Potassium content and pressure served as vitality indicators. Additionally, morphological criteria of tissue integrity were assessed using light and electron microscopy. Results:? A constant flow of 150?200?ml/min was optimal. The resulting pressure ranged from 30 to 117?mmHg. Light microscopy revealed, with exception of a few thromboses, no cellular damage after 4?h. The perfusion was successfully extended to 5?h. Then first pressure related alterations including vascular dilatations and cellular degeneration occurred in the dermal lamellae but not in the other regions. Potassium never exceeded physiological values. Conclusion:? The model is now available for experiments. Equipment and technical implementation have been standardized and described in a standard operating procedure. The model will be challenged by bioactive molecules such as lactate, neuropeptides and chemokines. Ischaemic conditions will be simulated and studied. This work was supported by the European Communities under the Lame Cow Project QLK5-CT-2002-00969.The authors are solely responsible and the work does not necessarily represent the opinion of the European Communities.

AB  - Summary The overall success rate for aphakic contact lens wear is related to motivation. It is highest in bilateral cases. Most successful results occur in physically and mentally active individuals, and poorest results in the unilateral alphakic, especially in infancy. Prolonged, or extended wear gives hope to many patients at the extremes of age. The criteria for extended wear is high gas flow materials, perfection in optical finish, and best fitting lens form. When considering the different materials available and their physio-chemical properties, attention must be paid to the lens form. Thus high plasticity and low elasticity means a large lens, and high elasticity a small thin lens. The problems of constant wear are still sufficiently serious to make such lenses experimental in use. Thus infect/on can occur secondary to chronic oedema and trauma of the surface epithelium. Infection may be introduced at the time of insertion, but also arises by the abnormal environment produced by contact lens wear resulting in gram negative pathogenic organisms invading the cornea. Whilst the aphakic eye may be an easy eye to fit and tolerate the lens, this may mask the onset of chronic oedema and neovascularisation. Studies in the Contact Lens Department at Moorfields using 85% Sauflon and 75% Duragel indicate over 50% of aphakics in the adult group wear soft lenses constantly for several months, but new lenses are often required every six months and in children more often. Better surfaced lenses are necessary before a safer system will result to encourage prolonged wear.
