AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Summary Thoracic surgery addresses the operative repair of the chest wall and organs within the chest cavity (principally the lungs and oesophagus) exclusive of the heart and great vessels. Common surgical conditions include chest trauma, chest wall deformities and tumours, pleural effusion and empyema, pneumothorax, gastro-oesophageal reflux and oesophageal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and mediastinal tumours. Minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS) or open thoracotomy may be employed to access and/or remove the pathology. Surgery is very effective in managing the majority of these conditions and patients with malignant tumours may receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as an adjuvant or definitive therapy depending on tumour staging.

AB  - Summary Injury or illness involving the thorax frequently interferes with ventilation. The initial management must be directed to ensuring adequate oxygenation by administering oxygen prior to physical examination and considering other procedures. Secondly, injured patients may be hypovolemic due to blood loss, and ill patients may be hypovolemic due to the primary problem. Thirdly, administration of analgesia appropriate for the degree of pain, and to confer sedation to facilitate physical examination and pursue further procedures. Where ventilation is compromised requiring anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, selecting the appropriate regimen based on patient stability. Contraindications for local and epidural blocks are a significant wound or evidence of infection, over the anatomical area where the local block is to be performed with needle insertion. The veterinarian technician/nurse (VT/N) should always have intubation supplies ready for rapid sequence intubation in the thoracic trauma/respiratory distress patient, as sedation does not always have the desired effect.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFÎ± degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immobilization as a result of long-term bed rest can lead to gradual bone loss. Due to their distribution throughout the bone matrix and remarkable interconnectivity, osteocytes represent the major mechanosensors in bone and translate mechanical into biochemical signals controlling bone remodeling. To test whether immobilization affects the characteristics of the osteocyte network in human cortical bone, femoral diaphyseal bone specimens were analyzed in immobilized female individuals and compared to age-matched postmenopausal individuals with primary osteoporosis. Premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy individuals served as control groups. Cortical porosity, osteocyte number and lacunar area, the frequency of hypermineralized lacunae as well as cortical bone calcium content (CaMean) were assessed using bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Bone matrix properties were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the immobilization group, cortical porosity was significantly higher, and qBEI revealed a trend towards higher matrix mineralization compared to osteoporotic individuals. Osteocyte density and canalicular density showed a declining rate from premenopausal towards healthy postmenopausal and osteoporotic individuals with peculiar reductions in the immobilization group, while the number of hypermineralized lacunae accumulated inversely. In conclusion, reduced osteocyte density and impaired connectivity during immobilization are associated with a specific bone loss pattern, reflecting a phenotype clearly distinguishable from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Immobilization periods may lead to a loss of survival signals for osteocytes, provoking bone loss that is even higher than in osteoporosis states, while osteocytic osteolysis remains absent.

AB  - Abstract Background Experimental evidence indicates that general anaesthetics can induce apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain. The majority of these studies have been performed in the absence of surgery and it currently remains unclear how the presence of surgical stimuli would influence neuroapoptosis as well as systemic homeostasis. Here we explored this possibility by performing dorsal skin flap surgery in young and adult rats under four distinct currently used anaesthesia regimens. Methods Young (21-days) and adult (2 months) male Sprague?Dawley rats were randomized to 150 min exposure to one of four anaesthetics regimens: (i) sevoflurane/dexmedetomidine, (ii) sevoflurane/fentanyl; (iii) propofol/dexmedetomidine, and (iv) propofol/fentanyl. Animals underwent a dorsal skin flap procedure while physiologic, metabolic and biochemical parameters were closely monitored. Neuroapoptotic profiles were evaluated in the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3) at the end of the procedure in each experimental group. Results Significant perturbations of systemic homeostasis were found under all anaesthetic regimens. Hyperglycemia and decreased heart rate were particularly relevant in experimental groups receiving dexmedetomidine, while propofol administration was associated with increased systemic lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. A substantial difference in anaesthesia/surgery-induced neuroapoptosis was found between young and adult rats in several brain regions. Combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine resulted in the highest number of caspase-3 positive cells, although the extent of cell death remained relatively low in all experimental groups. Conclusion Combination of anaesthesia and surgery induces significant perturbations of physiological parameters in both young and adult spontaneously breathing rats undergoing surgery. These observations further enlighten the need for detailed physiological monitoring under these experimental conditions. Although some statistically significant differences in activated caspase-3 profiles were detected between experimental groups, the overall extent of neuronal cell death remained very low under all conditions questioning, thereby, the physiological significance of apoptotic neurodegeneration in the context of anaesthesia and surgery.

AB  - Summary Supragingival and subgingival plaque appear to be the multifactorial initiating sources of oropharyngeal inflammation in cats. Inflammation may occur secondary to internal triggers and stimulation from antigens and pathogens located within or below the gingiva and oral mucosa. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of periodontal disease where the inflammation is confined to the gingival soft tissues and does not clinically extend into the tooth's support. Periodontal diseases are the most common oral maladies diagnosed in dogs and cats. Furcation involvement or exposure occurs secondary to periodontitis. Oronasal fistula are established communications between the oral and nasal cavities secondary to advanced periodontal disease extending from the palatal surfaces of the maxillary canine in dogs and from traumatic extraction of the maxillary canine teeth. Professional oral care includes mechanical procedures performed in the oral cavity.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score â¥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - Summary Hypertonic saline has been in clinical use for many decades. Its osmotic and volume-expanding properties make it theoretically useful for a number of indications in critical care. This literature review evaluates the use of hypertonic saline in critical care. The putative mechanism of action is presented, followed by a narrative review of its clinical usefulness in critical care. The review was conducted using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network method for the review of cohort studies, randomised-controlled trials and meta-analyses. The review focuses specifically on blood pressure restoration and outcome benefit in both haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic shock, and the management of raised intracranial pressure. Issues of clinical improvement and outcome benefit are addressed. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective for blood pressure restoration in haemorrhagic, but not other, types of shock. There is no survival benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions in shock. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective at reducing intracranial pressure in conditions causing acute intracranial hypertension. There is no survival or outcome benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions for raised intracranial pressure. Recommendations for clinical use and future directions of clinical research are presented.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - Abstract In group-living species, individuals often have preferred affiliative social partners, with whom ties or bonds can confer advantages that correspond with greater fitness. For example, in adult female baboons and juvenile horses, individuals with stronger or more social ties experience greater survival. We used detailed behavioral and life history records to explore the relationship between tie quality and survival in a gregarious monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni), while controlling for dominance rank, group size, and life history strategy. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the cumulative (multi-year) and current (single-year) relationships of social ties and the hazard of mortality in 83 wild adult females of known age, observed 2?8Â years each (437 subject-years) in eight social groups. The strength of bonds with close partners was associated with increased mortality risk under certain conditions: Females that had strong bonds with close partners that were inconsistent over multiple years had a higher risk of mortality than females adopting any other social strategy. Within a given year, females had a higher risk of death if they were strongly bonded with partners that changed from the previous year versus with partners that remained consistent. Dominance rank, number of adult female groupmates, and age at first reproduction did not predict the risk of death. This study demonstrates that costs and benefits of strong social bonds can be context-dependent, relating to the consistency of social partners over time.

Six patients with fulminant hepatic failure received a bolus injection of a concentrated fibronectin-rich preparation. The mean plasma immunoreactive fibronectin level increased from 53 Â± SE 12 ?g ml-1 initially to 295 Â± 30 ?g ml-1 (P < 0Â·001) at 1 h after fibronectin administration. The in vitro plasma opsonic activity was also increased from 5Â·6 Â± 3Â·6% of control to 102 Â± 13% (P < 0Â·005) at 1 h. No similar effect was observed with the clearance of microaggregated albumin, but as its clearance is probably not dependent on fibronectin it may reflect a different aspect of reticuloendothelial cell function. No significant changes were observed in cardiopulmonary function or oxygen utilization and it is possible this is because clearance of opsonized particles is limited by damage to Kupffer cells.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Summary Many of the topical products noted can be considered ?natural?, such as chitosan, collagen, and alginates. This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.
