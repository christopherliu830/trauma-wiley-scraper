AB  - Abstract Patients with fulminant hepatic failure have low levels of the plasma opsonizing protein fibronectin together with cardiovascular disturbances similar to those in septic shock where microembolization of capillary beds by particulate debris has been proposed to lead to multi-organ failure. Six patients with fulminant hepatic failure received a bolus injection of a concentrated fibronectin-rich preparation. The mean plasma immunoreactive fibronectin level increased from 53 ± SE 12 ?g ml-1 initially to 295 ± 30 ?g ml-1 (P < 0·001) at 1 h after fibronectin administration. The in vitro plasma opsonic activity was also increased from 5·6 ± 3·6% of control to 102 ± 13% (P < 0·005) at 1 h. No similar effect was observed with the clearance of microaggregated albumin, but as its clearance is probably not dependent on fibronectin it may reflect a different aspect of reticuloendothelial cell function. No significant changes were observed in cardiopulmonary function or oxygen utilization and it is possible this is because clearance of opsonized particles is limited by damage to Kupffer cells.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - 1 Antagonists acting at the polyamine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, including a number of heterocyclic aminoalcohols related to ifenprodil, were investigated to establish their functional interaction at the NMDA receptor and their neuroprotective profile. 2 In murine cultured neocortical neurones, NMDA (100?m)-stimulated production of guanosine 3?:5?-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was blocked by N-l([thienyl]-cyclohexyl)-piperidine (1 ?m) and by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 ?m). Ifenprodil and structurally related heterocyclic aminoalcohols inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the NMDAstimulated, NO-dependent production of cyclic GMP; rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 3 All of the polyamine NMDA antagonists blocked NMDA (300 ?m)-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium concentrations as measured by changes in the fluorescence of pre-loaded fluo-3-acetoxy methyl ester. Rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > 840S > tibalosine > threotibalosine. 4 In a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the polyamine NMDA antagonists as blockers of NMDA-induced cytotoxicity, all of the drugs were found to inhibit the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase after the exposure of the murine neocortical cultures to NMDA (100 ?m, 5 h). Rank potency order was: 2309 BT > ifenprodil > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 5 These results provide direct evidence that polyamine NMDA antagonists produce a functional blockade of the NMDA receptor complex. The heterocyclic aminoalcohols described herein, like ifenprodil, block NMDA-mediated elevation of intracellular NO and calcium, two key events in the excitotoxic cascade, and are cytoprotective.

AB  - Methods to reliably measure tissue oxygenation in situ are currently lacking. We have developed a vertically oriented, dorsal, bipedicle flap model that is easy to perform, reliably reproduces tissue ischemia, eliminates craniocaudal variation, and is amenable to studying therapeutic modalities. The effect of narrowing this flap on tissue oxygenation measured with Licox electrodes has previously been presented. In this study we utilize in situ EPR spectroscopy to demonstrate the oxygen gradient in the flap as a function of flap width and placement of a silicone sheet directly under the flap. The effect of wound healing over a 2 week period is demonstrated. Twenty four, 300?gm male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the bipedicle flap according to the following groups: 2.5?cm flap with silicone, 2.0?cm flap without silicone, 2.0?cm flap with silicone. Each group of 6 animals was injected with EMS char at 2?cm intervals along the flap and one injection in the control, non-ischemic tissue. A 4th group underwent 2.0?cm flaps with silicone and use of lithium phthalocyanin as the paramagnetic material. Wound measurements and EPR spectroscopy were performed on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. On day 14, after EPR measurements, the animals were sacrificed and their wounds excised. One flap and one control wound were preserved for histologic analysis, the other flap and control wounds were prepared for lactate measurements. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated a gradient of oxygen that was lowest in the center of the flap and greatest at either end. Changes in the oxygen gradient correlated with narrowing and placement of the intervening silicone sheet. This new technology has never been utilized in an animal model of impaired wound healing. Comparison of recently developed paramagnetic materials for optimal tissue oxygen and free radical measurements will be presented.

AB  - Abstract Aim: To investigate: 1) the occurrence of hypoxic hepatitis in full-term infants after birth asphyxia, 2) the temporal enzyme pattern in asphyxiated newborn infants, and 3) whether the degree of hypoxic hepatitis, as reflected by the rise in aminotransferase, correlates with the severity of the asphyxia and CNS symptomatology. Methods: Serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total and conjugated bilirubin, cholinesterase activity, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), and nucleated red blood cell count were prospectively measured in full-term asphyxiated newborn infants (n=26). Samples were collected three times during the first 72 h and once between days 6 and 12 after birth. Samples from healthy newborns (n=56), collected 24?172 h after birth, served as controls. Results: In 12 of the 26 asphyxiated infants, a serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT) pattern compatible with hypoxic hepatitis was found. Five infants showed increased S-ALAT activity but with a different pattern. Similar patterns were seen in serum aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT). S-ALAT and -ASAT concentrations 0?72 h after birth correlated significantly with severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Conclusion: Birth asphyxia can induce an enzyme pattern in serum compatible to hypoxic hepatitis. There seems to be a correlation between aminotransferases in serum and the extent of CNS injury.

AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

AB  - Abstract Electrodes can provide information on neural function and stimulate neural activity. These neural electrodes can provide remarkable benefit to people suffering physical trauma or neural disease. Traditional metal electrodes have shortcomings related to poor biostability, cytocompatibility, and a rigid structure that maps poorly to tissue. Organic conductors can be formed with various chemical and physical properties to create improved electrode-neural interfaces. The processability of organic conductors enables their use in advanced fabrication methods. This review details the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conducting polymers for neural interfacing. Construction of novel neural electrode architectures via advanced fabrication processes is also addressed.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in children >1 year of age, with haemorrhage as the most common cause of medically preventable deaths. While massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have been investigated and used in adults to reduce death from haemorrhage, there are a paucity of published data on MTP practices and outcomes in children. This study aimed to survey current MTP policies and the frequency of activation at paediatric care centres. Study design and methods We conducted a survey of MTPs at hospitals in the United States and Canada, including children's general hospitals, children's specialty hospitals and children's units in general hospitals. We collected information on how the MTP is activated, what therapeutics are given, frequency of its use, and how it is audited for compliance. Results Forty-six survey responses were analysed. Physician discretion was the most common activation criteria (89%). A majority of sites (78%) targeted a ?high? (≥1 : 2) ratio of plasma to red blood cells (RBC). Fifteen percent of sites use antifibrinolytics in their MTPs. Eighty nine percent of sites have type-O RBC units and 48% of sites had thawed plasma units stored in an immediately available location. Conclusion There is a wide variation in MTPs among paediatric hospitals with regard to both activation criteria and products administered. This underscores the need for future prospective studies to determine the most effective resuscitation methods for paediatric populations to improve outcomes and therapeutic safety for massive bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Objective Pain medicine still lacks mechanism-specific biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment, and defective top-down modulation is an important factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions. Using modern analytical tools and advanced multivariate statistical analysis, the aim of this study was to revisit two classical potential biomarkers of pro- and anti-nociception in humans (substance P and beta-endorphin), focusing particularly on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Design Cross-sectional, comparative, observational study. Subjects Patients with chronic, post-traumatic and/or post-surgical, neuropathic pain refractory to conventional treatment (N?=?15) and healthy controls (N?=?19) were included. Methods Samples were taken from CSF and blood, and levels of substance P and beta-endorphin were investigated using a Luminex technology kit. Results We found low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF of neuropathic pain patients (66?±?11?pcg/mL) compared with healthy controls (115?±?14?pcg/mL) (P?=?0.017). Substance P levels in the CSF did not differ (20?±?2?pcg/mL, 26?±?2, P?=?0.08). However, our multivariate data analysis showed that belonging to the patient group was associated with low levels of both substances in the CSF. A higher correlation between the levels of beta-endorphin and substance P in CSF was found in healthy controls than in patients (rs?=?0.725, P?<?0.001 vs rs?=?0.574, P?=?0.032). Conclusions Patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to trauma or surgery had low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF. We speculate that this could indicate a defective top-down modulation of pain in chronic neuropathic pain. Our results also illustrate the importance of taking a system-wide, multivariate approach when searching for biomarkers.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe a large segmental (sub-total) mandibulectomy for removal of an undifferentiated sarcoma in a horse. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 10-year-old mare. Methods A combination of methods including computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a large undifferentiated sarcoma of the right mandible. A large segmental mandibulectomy extending from 3?cm below the right temporomandibular joint to immediately caudal to tooth 407 was used to perform an en-bloc resection of the mass under general anesthesia. Results Surgery time was 11?hours and 35?minutes and total anesthesia time, 12?hours and 40?minutes. The mare was eating well 3 days after surgery. Some postoperative skin sloughing occurred, but the cosmetic and functional outcome was good. The mare continued to do well, with no evidence of disease recurrence, 24 months after surgery. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT images was instrumental in surgical planning. A very large portion of the mandible can be removed in a horse with acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Abstract Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of inflammasome is involved in the development of a wide spectrum of diseases. We aimed to investigate whether (?)schisandrin B [(?)Sch B], a phytochemical that can induce cellular antioxidant response, can suppress the inflammasome activation. Results showed that (?)Sch B can induce an nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-driven thioredoxin expression in primary peritoneal macrophages and cultured RAW264.7 macrophages. A 4-h priming of peritoneal macrophages with LPS followed by a 30-min incubation with ATP caused the activation of caspase 1 and the release of IL-1?, indicative of inflammasome activation. Although LPS/ATP did not activate inflammasome in RAW264.7 macrophages, it caused the ROS-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase1/2 (JNK1/2) activation and an associated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in RAW264.7 macrophages, an indication of cytotoxicity. (?)Sch B suppressed the LPS/ATP-induced activation of caspase 1 and release of IL-1? in peritoneal macrophages. (?)Sch B also attenuated the LPS/ATP-induced ROS production, JNK1/2 activation and LDH release in RAW264.7 macrophages. The ability of (?)Sch B to suppress LPS/ATP-mediated inflammation in vitro was further confirmed by an animal study, in which schisandrin B treatment (2 mmol/kg p.o.) ameliorated the Imject Alum-induced peritonitis, as indicated by suppressions of caspase1 activation and plasma IL-1? level. The ensemble of results suggests that (?)Sch B may offer a promising prospect for preventing the inflammasome-mediated disorders. ? 2015 BioFactors, 41(5):314?323, 2015
