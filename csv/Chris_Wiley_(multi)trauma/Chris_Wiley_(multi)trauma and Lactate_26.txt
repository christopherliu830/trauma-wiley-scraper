AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of treating infrapopliteal lesions using a novel drug delivery catheter locally delivering liquid paclitaxel. Background Balloon angioplasty is currently the Gold Standard to treat below-the-knee disease; however, restenosis continues to be a great challenge following these percutaneous revascularization procedures. Methods The Occlusion Perfusion Catheter for Optimal Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Prevention of Endovascular Restenosis (COPPER-A) study?Below-the-Knee Cohort was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, feasibility, and safety study that enrolled 35 patients at 11 participating sites. The safety endpoints at 1, 3, and 6 months were freedom from thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. The efficacy endpoints were primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Thirty-five patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 112?±?81.2?mm with the lesion length range of 20?286?mm. At 6-month follow-up, primary patency was 89.3% and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.4%. No patients demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up intervals. Conclusions The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that infrapopliteal arteries can be safely and effectively treated with liquid paclitaxel using the occlusion perfusion catheter.

AB  - Summary Nursing cats and dogs will benefit from ongoing analgesia post-cesarean, or to manage post-surgical or traumatic pain or inflammatory illness. It is hoped that future studies investigating the commonly prescribed analgesics, including the secretion of analgesics in milk of lactating dogs and cats, will be undertaken to offer guidance in managing this group of animals. An alternative, or as post-operative analgesia a fentanyl, continuous rate infusion (CRI), with careful titration to a minimal effective dose, is suggested for cats and dogs. A clinical interpretation of analgesia may be due to behavioural changes and sedation produced by serotonin re-uptake inhibition. Anesthesia and analgesia protocols should be designed based on the health status of the dam/queen, the procedural need and the expected pain level. Alpha2 agonists are commonly administered to cows and mares without apparent effect on the neonatal calf or foal, but the effects may be different in puppies and kittens.

AB  - A 12-year-old, castrated male, domestic long-haired cat experienced massive haemorrhage associated with an incision of a swelling on the neck 2 weeks after right-sided ventral bulla osteotomy. Emergent control of haemorrhage was gained through unilateral carotid artery ligation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was provided in conjunction with massive blood transfusion. The cat made an unremarkable recovery. Carotid artery pseudoaneurysm due to surgical disruption of the carotid artery during ventral bulla osteotomy, specifically through the use of self-retaining retractors, was suspected. This case highlights the development of pseudoaneurysm as a potential complication of head and neck surgery, and additionally describes a case of massive transfusion in a cat.

AB  - ABSTRACT The murine dorsum dermal excisional wound model has been widely utilized with or without splint application. However, variations in experimental methods create challenges for direct comparison of results provided in the literature and for design of new wound healing studies. Here, we investigated the effects of wound location and size, number of wounds, type of adhesive used for splint fixation on wound healing using splinted or unsplinted dorsum excisional full thickness wound models. One or two 6- or 8-mm full thickness wounds were made with or without splinting in genetically diabetic but heterozygous mice (Dock7m?+?/?+?Leprdb). Two different adhesives: tissue adhesive and an over the counter cyanoacrylate adhesive (OTCA) ?Krazy glue? were used to fix splints. Wound contraction, wound closure, and histopathological parameters including reepithelialization, collagen deposition and inflammation were compared between groups. No significant effect of wound number (1 vs. 2), side (left vs. right and cranial vs. caudal) or size on wound healing was observed. The OTCA group had a significantly higher splint success compared to the tissue adhesive group that resulted in significantly higher reepithelialization and collagen deposition in the OTCA group. Understanding the outcomes and effects of the variables will help investigators choose appropriate experimental conditions for the study purpose and interpret data.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Hemolysis is a potential limitation of percutaneously delivered left-sided mechanical circulatory support pumps, including trans valvular micro-axial flow pumps (TVP). Hemolytic biomarkers among durable left ventricular assist devices include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and plasma-free hemoglobin (pf-Hb) >20 mg/dL. We examined the predictive value of these markers among patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) receiving a TVP. We retrospectively studied records of 116 consecutive patients receiving an Impella TVP at our institution between 2012 and 2017 for CS. Twenty-three met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and had sufficient pf-Hb data for analysis. Area under receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for diagnosing hemolysis were calculated. Mean age was 62 ± 14 years and ejection fraction was 15 ± 5%. Mean duration of support was 5.4 ± 3.5 days. Pre-device LDH levels were >2.5x ULN in 71% (n = 5/7) of 5.0 and 29% of CP patients, while pre-device pf-Hb levels were >20 mg/dL in 14% (n = 1/7) of 5.0 and 25% (n = 4/16) of CP patients. Given elevated baseline LDH and pf-Hb levels, we defined hemolysis as a pf-Hb level >40 mg/dL within 72 h post-implant plus clinical evidence of device-related hemolysis. We identified that 30% (n = 7/23) had device-related hemolysis. Using ROC curve-derived cut-points, an increase in delta pf-Hb by >27mg/dL, not delta LDH, within 24 h after TVP implant (delta pf-Hb: C-statistic?=?0.79, sensitivity: 57%, specificity: 93%, p <0.05) was highly predictive of hemolysis. In conclusion, we identified a change in pf-Hb, not LDH, levels is highly sensitive and specific for hemolysis in patients treated with a TVP for CS.

AB  - This chapter details instruction on the basics of effective bovine female urinogenital surgery, including proper instrumentation, asepsis, effective anaesthesia and essential techniques. This surgery includes techiques for the following: caesarean section; vaginal and cervical prolapse; uterine prolapse; perineal laceration; episiotomy; ovariectomy; and bladder eversion. Historically, hydroallantois and hydroamnion were further indications for a two-stage caesarean section (day one: slow drainage of uterine fluids; day two: caesarean section). Such cases have a better prognosis if early calving is induced before a full-term pregnancy with corticosteroids and prostaglandins, possibly followed several days later by an i.v. oxytocin drip in non-responsive cases. Vaginal and cervical prolapse is typically seen in late gestation or the early post-partum period in fat beef and dairy breeds. Salvage after parturition is the best solution, as it will recur in the succeeding gestation.

AB  - Summary. New methods are described for platelet isolation and buoyant density determination using low-speed centrifugation in continuous density gradients of Percoll. The conditions used do not induce loss of granule or cytoplasmic markers and enable reproducible platelet frequency distributions to be obtained in linear density gradients. Such frequency distributions are normal with a mode of 1·0645 ± 0·0015 g cm?3 (mean ± SD, n= 20). Platelets fixed in 0·1% glutaraldehyde show a modal density of 1·0712 ± 0·0005 g cm?3. Content of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-thromboglobulin and 3H-serotonin correlate closely with platelet numbers throughout the density distribution. The frequency distribution of platelet volume between 2·2 and 21 fl fits a log normal model and cell volume in density subfractions from the most dense to the least dense also approximate log normality. There is a positive correlation between mean platelet volume and buoyant density with a small increment between the least and the most dense extremes. Platelet subfractions separated by volume using a FACS II cell sorter differ substantially from each other in cell volume but the difference in mean density of four different volume fractions is negligible. In discontinuous density gradients of Stractan factors other than platelet density must influence the separation of platelets, as rebanding of platelets from interfaces shows a wide variation in buoyant density when analysed in continuous gradients. It is concluded that analysis of platelet buoyant density in continuous Percoll gradients supports the view that platelet density, like platelet volume, is determined primarily during thrombocytopoiesis and that volume and density are largely independent elements of platelet heterogeneity.

AB  - Objective:? Following tissue vascular and oxygen delivery disruption, normal wound healing is a complex process requiring restoration of supplies of oxygen and other nutrients through blood vessel regeneration, or angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is stimulated by synergistic interactions of growth factors and cytokines secreted by damaged cells in wound tissues exhibiting hypoxia, high lactate levels, and inflammation. Chronic wounds, often complications of diabetes, are characterized by chronic hypoxia, inflammation, and insufficient growth factor secretion. To test growth factor sensitivity to reversed hypoxia in chronic human wounds, we administered pure oxygen topically to chronic foot ulcers in diabetic humans and used molecular probes to measure growth factors previously found to regulate angiogenesis and improve delayed healing, i.e., VEGF et?al. Methods:? By multiplex ELISA assays of growth factor cytokines, we quantified pg/ug levels of total proteins detectable in fluids collected from human diabetic plantar wounds after exposure to topical oxygen delivered in 0?50?mm?Hg pulses during 90-minute treatments 4 days per week over a 5 week protocol. Wounds that had failed to heal for at least 4 weeks were infused with a maximum of 1.06 ATM of oxygen at 1 minute intervals in a lower limb enclosing chamber. Findings:? Our initial data show increased expression in angiogenesis-related growth factors (bFGF, HB-EGF, HGF, KGF, VEGF) in wound fluid from chronic diabetic foot ulcers using the Topical Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber (Advanced Hyperbaric Technologies, Inc., Farmingdale, NJ). Secretion of the most crucial angiogenic factor, VEGF, was increased by 8-fold to well over 10-fold using the described protocol. Conclusions:? These data show evidence of a molecular mechanism for the scientific basis of topical hyperbaric oxygen-modulated growth factor expression in chronic diabetic wounds, previously unresponsive to standard wound care. We conclude that topically applied hyperbaric oxygen alters angiogenesis-related growth factor expression in wound fluids from chronic diabetic foot ulcers in a manner consistent with renewed healing.

AB  - Summary Background There is limited information about bacterial isolates that are present on the equine midline incision during and following exploratory laparotomy. Objectives To investigate the bacterial species cultured from the ventral midline pre-, intra- and post- laparotomy, whether particular bacterial isolates are associated with the development of surgical site infections (SSIs) and to report the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of these isolates. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods The ventral midline of 31 horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy was sampled for bacterial culture at set time-points pre, intra and post-operatively. Inclusion criteria were that horses must have undergone exploratory laparotomy within 90 min of the initial colic examination upon hospital admission and must not have been placed in a stable prior to surgery. SSI was defined as any purulent or serous discharge from the laparotomy incision of >24 h duration. Results Seven horses (22.6%) developed a SSI. None of the variables tested were associated with the altered risk of SSI. The prevalence of a positive bacterial culture from the incision increased progressively over time and a variety of bacteria were isolated. A positive intra-operative culture was not a predictor of SSI; and when a SSI did occur, it was due to a different bacterial isolate. MRSA and ESBL-producers were identified in the post-operative period in one and four different horses respectively, but none of these developed a SSI. Main limitations Sampling was limited to hospitalisation and no culture results were available for horses developing SSI following hospital discharge. Conclusions A variety of bacterial species may be isolated from equine laparotomy incisions peri-operatively without development of SSI. SSI does not appear to be solely related to bacterial contamination of the incision peri-operatively and other mechanisms such as bacteraemia merit further investigation.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care
