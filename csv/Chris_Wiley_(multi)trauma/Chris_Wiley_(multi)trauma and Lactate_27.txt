AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Objective- The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the biochemical integrity of equine colonic mucosa to assess the relative roles of ischemic- and reperfusion-induced damage. Study Design- Two hours of no-flow ischemia experimentally induced by 720° counterclockwise ascending colon volvulus followed by 2 hours reperfusion after derotation. Animals- Ten ponies. Methods- Ascending colon biopsies were obtained every hour for measurement of mucosal adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, sodium, and potassium content. Additional samples were homogenized for assay of mitochondrial respiratory function. Results- ATP content diminished 92% after ischemia and recovered to only 44% of control levels (P <.001 versus controls) after 2 hours reperfusion. Reperfusion increased mucosal water and decreased sodium and potassium content for the duration of the experiment. Both NADH- (pyruvate) and FADH-linked (succinate) respiration decreased after ischemia and did not recover during reperfusion indicating electron transport chain dysfunction. Conclusions- Two hours ischemia induced severe metabolic dysfunction in equine colon mucosa which persisted throughout reperfusion. Unequivocal evidence of injury specific to reperfusion was not observed in this study suggesting that much of the damage observed during reperfusion may be a continuation of injury induced during the ischemic period and not specific to reperfusion per se. Clinical Relevance- This study suggests that greater efforts to metabolically support ischemically injured mucosa may be an important aspect of obtaining improved survival of horses affected by ascending colon volvulus (ACV).

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a metastatic cancer invading the central nervous system (CNS). We previously reported a metabolomic diagnostic approach as tested on an animal model and compared with current modalities. Here, we provide a proof of concept by applying it to human LC originating from lung cancer, the most common cause of CNS metastasis. Cerebrospinal fluid from LC (n?=?26) and normal groups (n?=?41) were obtained, and the diagnosis was established with clinical signs, cytology, MRI and biochemical tests. The cytology on the CSF, the current gold standard, exhibited 69% sensitivity (?100% specificity) from the first round of CSF tapping. In comparison, the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra on the CSF showed a clear difference in the metabolic profile between the LC and normal groups. Multivariate analysis and cross-validation yielded the diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, the specificity of 96% and the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991. Further spectral and statistical analysis identified myo-inositol (p?<?5 ? 10?14), creatine (p?<?7 ? 10?8), lactate (p?<?9 ? 10?4), alanine (p?<?7.9 ? 10?3) and citrate (p?<?3 ? 10?4) as the most contributory metabolites, whose combination exhibited an receiver?operating characteristic diagnostic AUC of 0.996. In addition, the metabolic profile could be correlated with the grading of radiological leptomeningeal enhancement (R2?=?0.3881 and p?=?6.66 ? 10?4), suggesting its potential utility in grading LC. Overall, we propose that the metabolomic approach might augment current diagnostic modalities for LC, the accurate diagnosis of which remains a challenge.

AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - Abstract Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date. The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges. A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented. The combination of zero-dimensional nanoparticles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics. The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs. This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 µM detection limit, 0.01?50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (>1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Abstract The neonatal mortality during hospital stay of live-born babies in a large government hospital is assessed in the light of various maternal factors and neonatal problems. The complete records of every neonatal death along with record of all deliveries over a period of 18 months were maintained prospectively and analysed. Out of total 9,374 deliveries, 8,931 were live births, of which 438 were neonatal deaths. Thus the neonatal mortality was 49.04 per 1,000 live births, of which 89.5% were early neonatal deaths. The main contributors to neonatal mortality were prematurity (22.8%), hyaline membrane disease (20.8%), birth asphyxia (15.7%), sepsis (14.4%), malformations (11.4%), other respiratory problems (8.9%) and birth trauma (3.4%). The main causes of late neonatal deaths were sepsis, respiratory problems and malformations. Of the total live births 13.95% were having birth weight of less than 2 kg and these contributed to 79.6% of neonatal deaths. Of all neonatal deaths, 52.5% were preterm babies. The various high risk factors and measures to reduce neonatal mortality are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND Diagnosis of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) in patients with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms is challenging without using invasive urodynamic tests. Recently, we showed in vitro that urothelial strips from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) release more ATP than controls. Here, we tested whether urinary ATP can be used as a wall tension transducer non-invasive biomarker to detect BOO in patients with BPH. METHODS 79 male patients with BOO and 22 asymptomatic controls were recruited prospectively. Patients were asked to complete the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire and to void at normal desire into a urinary flowmeter; the postvoid residual volume was determined by suprapubic ultrasonography. Urine samples from all individuals were examined for ATP, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase. RESULTS BOO patients had significantly higher (P?<?0.001) urinary ATP normalized by the voided volume (456?±?36?nmol) than age-matched controls (209?±?35?nmol). Urinary ATP amounts increased with the voided volume, but the slope of this rise was higher in BOO patients than in controls. A negative correlation was detected between urinary ATP and flow rate parameters, namely maximal flow rate (r?=??0.310, P?=?0.005), Siroky flow-volume normalization (r?=??0.324, P?=?0.004), and volume-normalized flow rate index (r?=??0.320, P?=?0.012). We found no correlation with LUT symptoms IPSS score. Areas under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were 0.91 (95%CI 0.86?0.96, P?<?0.001) for ATP alone and 0.88 (95%CI 0.81?0.94, P?<?0,001) when adjusted to urinary creatinine. CONCLUSIONS Patients with BOO release higher amounts of ATP into the urine than the control group. The high area under the ROC curve suggests that urinary ATP can be a high-sensitive non-invasive biomarker of BOO, which may have a discriminative value of detrusor competence when comparing BPH patients with low urinary flow rates.

AB  - Abstract Background As we enter the era of milestones and competency-based medical education (CBME), there is an increasing need to examine the procedures for stratifying objectives into levels of achievement. Most techniques used to date (e.g., Delphi surveys) involve some sort of consensus-based process, essentially crowd-sourcing wisdom of multiple educators to set anticipated milestones. In most graduate education settings, however, many simply use the judgment of one or two educators when setting educational objectives. Meanwhile, standard-setting procedures have been historically used in medical education for setting cut-points to determine levels of acceptable performance and do so in a more robust manner. Objectives Inspired by these standard-setting procedures, the authors sought to develop a new way to stratify objectives into three relative levels of achievement (junior [ACGME level 1], intermediate [ACGME level 2?3], senior [ACGME level 4]). Methods The authors describe a novel, stepwise method that is composed of four steps. There are four steps to the McMOST procedure: 1) sorting objectives with a group of experienced teachers, 2) factor analysis to group preferences, 3) labeling components and reorganizing groupings, and 4) confirmation and final review by educational and content experts. Results Using McMOST method resulted in a change of placement for 15 of 34 (44%) of the milestones and improved agreement in two of three levels (intermediate from intraclass correlation of 0.56 to 0.80; senior from 0.69 to 0.79). Conclusions The authors describe a novel protocol for stratifying objectives that may be useful to stratify and sort competencies into various levels of achievement (e.g., milestones) in this era of CBME.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? The effect of successful and unsuccessful smoking cessation on depressive mood, anxiety- and suicide-related outcomes is unclear. The aim of this secondary analysis was to explore the relationship between abstinence status and these outcomes. Design? Cohort of adult smokers attempting to stop smoking. Smoking status was assessed by a daily diary; depressed mood, anxiety and suicidal tendencies by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The association of complete and point-prevalence abstinence with the HDRS variables was assessed using multi-level linear regression models. Setting? Randomized trial of sertraline versus placebo for smoking cessation with weekly behavioural support provided in a clinic. Participants? A total of 133 adult smokers with past major depression. Findings? Pre-quit mood scores did not predict smoking status post-quit day. Both continuous and point-prevalence abstainers had significantly lower total HDRS, suicide and anxiety scores, adjusted for all potential confounders, during the period following quit day than did non-abstainers who experienced a significant mood deterioration. There was a significant effect of sertraline on post-quit HDRS scores but not on abstinence. Conclusions? Contrary to expectation, smoking abstinence among smokers with a history of major depression did not lead to increase in depression, anxiety or suicide ideation; however, failed quit attempts did. Persisting with a quit attempt while unable to achieve abstinence may be associated with mood deterioration.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is the accumulation of exudate within the thoracic cavity. Species of bacteria most commonly associated with pyothorax differ in cats versus dogs. In cats, Pasteurella spp. is by far the predominant species cultured; in dogs, a wider variety of bacteria have been associated with the condition, mainly obligate anaerobes or a mixture of obligate anaerobes with facultative aerobic bacteria. The average age at presentation is between 4 and 5 years for cases of canine and feline pyothorax, although it may occur in all age groups. The most common hematologic and biochemical findings in canine and feline pyothorax are anemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis with a left shift, and hypoalbuminemia. Treatment of pyothorax in cats and dogs can be broadly divided into medical and surgical treatments. Primary medical management using thoracostomy tubes and antimicrobials with or without lavage is still used in the majority of cases successfully.
