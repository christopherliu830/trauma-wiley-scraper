AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Abstract Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of canine brain diseases are often nonspecific. Single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques allow quantification of chemical biomarkers for tissues of interest and may help to improve diagnostic specificity. However, published information is currently lacking for the in vivo performance of these two techniques in dogs. The aim of this prospective, methods comparison study was to compare the performance of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy in the brains of eight healthy, juvenile dogs using 3 Tesla MRI. Ipsilateral regions of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy were performed in symmetric regions of interest of each brain in the parietal (n = 3), thalamic (n = 2), and piriform lobes (n = 3). In vivo single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios from the same size and multi-voxel spectroscopy ratios from different sized regions of interest were compared. No significant difference was seen between single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios for any lobe when regions of interest were similar in size and shape. Significant lobar single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy differences were seen between the parietal lobe and thalamus (P = 0.047) for the choline to N-acetyl aspartase ratios when large multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest were compared to very small multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest within the same lobe; and for the N-acetyl aspartase to creatine ratios in all lobes when single-voxel spectroscopy was compared to combined (pooled) multi-voxel spectroscopy datasets. Findings from this preliminary study indicated that single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques using 3T MRI yield comparable results for similar sized regions of interest in the normal canine brain. Findings also supported using the contralateral side as an internal control for dogs with brain lesions.

Explosions in the understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes have recently been elucidated. In particular, the central role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the unfolding protein response (UPR) in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has recently been discovered. We hypothesize that ER stress and UPR are not only central for type 2 diabetes but also for stress-induced diabetes. We review here the evidence that post-burn insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common with type 2 diabetes. These recent discoveries not only highlight the importance of ER stress in the post-burn patient recovery, but furthermore enable new models to study fundamental and interventional aspects of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background? Flail chest in thoracic trauma is associated with significant complications and carries high morbidity and mortality. At present there is no standardized management plan for flail chest. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors affecting morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in the hospital. Methods? We evaluated all patients admitted to our trauma centre between January 2002 and December 2004. Age, presence of pneumothorax, trauma severity score (ISS), length of stay, lung contusion and deaths were recorded. Results? There were 100 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 19.8, range 17?90). The median length of stay was 17 days, and the average ISS score was 30 (SD 13.2). 74% had flail chest and lung contusion, 2 patients had pneumothorax, and 7 (7%) patients died 3 (5.4%) patients with 1?4 fractured ribs died, compared with 4 (8.9%) patients with 5 or more fractured ribs (p?=?0.70, Fisher?s exact test). The mean ISS score was 32.3 (SD 19.5) for those who died compared with 29.8 (SD 12.7) in those who did not die (p?=?0.63, t-test). There was a moderate positive correlation between ISS score and length of stay (r?=?0.36, p?=?0.0002, Pearson correlation coefficient). Conclusion? ISS score was found to be a moderate potential predictor on outcome regarding length of stay in the hospital. There is an apparent increased risk of death with more fractured ribs and therefore a standadised surgical management plan for ribs fixation may reduce the risk of death in this patient group.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - Summary The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

AB  - Objective? To present the technique for intra-articular catheter placement and report the clinical outcomes of 38 cases of equine synovial trauma and/or infection treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials administered via an intrasynovial catheter (ISC). Design? Retrospective study. Procedure? Medical records of 38 horses treated for synovial trauma and sepsis with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained via clinical re-evaluation or telephone contact with the owners. Results? The majority of horses (84%) received amikacin and Timentin? four times daily. In addition, synovial lavage through the ISC was carried out in 27 horses (71%). Only radiological evidence of osteolysis had a significant negative impact on both lameness at the time of hospital discharge and the long-term outcome. In total, 92% of horses treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had clinical resolution of infection. Catheter obstruction occurred in three cases, necessitating replacement or removal, and two synovial fistulae developed at sites of open drainage. The majority of horses treated had a favourable outcome, with 86% being at least pasture sound and 43% returned to riding. Conclusion? Septic synovial structures treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had a good prognosis for survival and 43% returned to riding, which is consistent with the results of other studies. The use of a simple ISC should be considered when broad-spectrum intrasynovial antimicrobial administration and lavage of a septic synovial structure are indicated.

AB  - Abstract Pain is one of the main complaints of trauma patients in (pre-hospital) emergency medicine. Significant deficiencies in pain management in emergency medicine have been identified. No evidence-based protocols or guidelines have been developed so far, addressing effectiveness and safety issues, taking the specific circumstances of pain management of trauma patients in the chain of emergency care into account. The aim of this systematic review was to identify effective and safe initial pharmacological pain interventions, available in the Netherlands, for trauma patients with acute pain in the chain of emergency care. Up to December 2011, a systematic search strategy was performed with MeSH terms and free text words, using the bibliographic databases CINAHL, PubMed and Embase. Methodological quality of the articles was assessed using standardized evaluation forms. Of a total of 2328 studies, 25 relevant studies were identified. Paracetamol (both orally and intravenously) and intravenous opioids (morphine and fentanyl) proved to be effective. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showed mixed results and are not recommended for use in pre-hospital ambulance or (helicopter) emergency medical services [(H)EMS]. These results could be used for the development of recommendations on evidence-based pharmacological pain management and an algorithm to support the provision of adequate (pre-hospital) pain management. Future studies should address analgesic effectiveness and safety of various drugs in (pre-hospital) emergency care. Furthermore, potential innovative routes of administration (e.g., intranasal opioids in adults) need further exploration.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite countless advancements in trauma care a survivability gap still exists in the prehospital setting. Military studies clearly identify hemorrhage as the leading cause of potentially survivable prehospital death. Shifting resuscitation from the hospital to the point of injury has shown great promise in decreasing mortality among the severely injured. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our regional trauma network (Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council) developed and implemented a multiphased approach toward facilitating remote damage control resuscitation. This approach required placing low-titer O+ whole blood (LTO+ WB) at helicopter emergency medical service bases, transitioning hospital-based trauma resuscitation from component therapy to the use of whole blood, modifying select ground-based units to carry and administer whole blood at the scene of an accident, and altering the practices of our blood bank to support our new initiative. In addition, we had to provide information and training to an entire large urban emergency medical system regarding changes in policy. RESULTS Through a thorough, structured program we were able to successfully implement point-of-injury resuscitation with LTO+ WB. Preliminary evaluation of our first 25 patients has shown a marked decrease in mortality compared to our historic rate using component therapy or crystalloid solutions. Additionally, we have had zero transfusion reactions or seroconversions. CONCLUSION Transfusion at the scene within minutes of injury has the potential to save lives. As our utilization expands to our outlying network we expect to see a continued decrease in mortality among significantly injured trauma patients.

AB  - According to clinical studies, degenerative diseases of canine joints lead to higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in synovial fluid. The goal of the present study was to examine the intraarticular distribution of LDH in healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints in order to identify possible sources of LDH in synovial fluid. As synovial LDH concentrations neither correlate with the number of leukocytes nor with synovitis, our investigation focused on the articular cartilage. Samples from healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). In addition, fresh cartilage samples were investigated cytochemically by the tetrazolium-formazan reaction. Analyses of blood and synovial fluid samples were used to confirm the absence of inflammatory disease. Morphology of articular cartilage was assessed macroscopically and by means of TEM. IHC revealed highest levels of LDH in chondrones and a diffuse labelling of the matrix with a distinctive decrease in signal from superficial to deeper cartilage layers. Ultrastructural localization by ICC showed LDH to be present in the cytoplasm of all chondrocytes and confirmed the density gradient in the matrix. Labelling was absent from nuclei and from pericellular rims. Cytochemistry confirmed the distribution pattern and, thus, expanded our findings beyond immunological evidence by providing proof of enzymatic activity of LDH in articular cartilage. The present results indicate that LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to the cartilaginous matrix. We suggest, therefore, that LDH found in synovial fluid originates from the articular cartilage and that osteoarthrotic processes promote LDH release from the cartilaginous matrix.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe haemodynamic resuscitation practices in ED patients with suspected sepsis and hypotension. Methods This was a prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in 70 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand between September 2018 and January 2019. Consecutive adults presenting to the ED during a 30-day period at each site, with suspected sepsis and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<100?mmHg) despite at least 1000?mL fluid resuscitation, were eligible. Data included baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory variables and intravenous fluid volume administered, vasopressor administration at baseline and 6- and 24-h post-enrolment, time to antimicrobial administration, intensive care admission, organ support and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 4477 patients were screened and 591 were included with a mean (standard deviation) age of 62 (19) years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 15.2 (6.6) and a median (interquartile range) systolic blood pressure of 94?mmHg (87?100). Median time to first intravenous antimicrobials was 77?min (42?148). A vasopressor infusion was commenced within 24?h in 177 (30.2%) patients, with noradrenaline the most frequently used (n = 138, 78%). A median of 2000?mL (1500?3000) of intravenous fluids was administered prior to commencing vasopressors. The total volume of fluid administered from pre-enrolment to 24?h was 4200?mL (3000?5661), with a range from 1000 to 12?200?mL. Two hundred and eighteen patients (37.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Overall in-hospital mortality was 6.2% (95% confidence interval 4.4?8.5%). Conclusion Current resuscitation practice in patients with sepsis and hypotension varies widely and occupies the spectrum between a restricted volume/earlier vasopressor and liberal fluid/later vasopressor strategy.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius has been the predominant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolated from canine skin and mucosae and the most commonly reported staphylococcal pathogen in small animal practice for the last 35 years. Although microbiological tests have historically indicated variability in biochemical characteristics amongst S. intermedius isolates from animals, an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy for clinical purposes was readily achievable with routine phenotypic testing. However, three recent developments have changed our understanding of the term ?S. intermedius? and have challenged veterinary bacteriologists to ensure correct species identification of pathogenic staphylococci from small animals. First, the increasing recognition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in small animal practice and its human health implications demand accurate species identification. Secondly, the application of molecular techniques to analysis of staphylococcal isolates has led to a revised taxonomy and canine isolates of S. intermedius being re-named S. pseudintermedius. Thirdly, the recent, rapid emergence of meticillin- and multi-drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a major therapeutic challenge in veterinary practice worldwide, including the UK. This article discusses the background of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Staphylococcus and reviews the key features of MRSP and its implications for day-to-day laboratory diagnosis and small animal practice.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.
