AB  - Introduction The development of miniaturized inertial sensor technology (IMU) opens new possibilities to assess equine back motion in real-life situations. The consistency of IMU for measuring dorsoventral displacement of the back has been assessed but orientation has not. The aim of this study was to assess accuracy and consistency of miniaturized inertial sensors for quantification of flexion-extension of the equine back, compared to motion capture (mocap) as a gold standard. Methods One sound horse was trotted (3.5?m/s) and cantered (9?m/s) on a treadmill with synchronized mocap and IMU data collection. The amplitudes of two flexion-extension angles were calculated between 3 IMUs (T12-T16-L2) and with a triad of markers linked to each IMU during 15 consecutive strides for two recordings at each gait. Consistency of sensor measurements was assessed using Lin correlation coefficient. Results Thoracic and thoracolumbar angles showed respectively a Lin correlation coefficient of 0.96 (excellent) and 0.87 (good). The difference (mean?±?SD) between IMU and mocap were, respectively for the thoracic and thoracolumbar angles, 0.57?±?0.44 and 0.65?±?0.47 degrees during trotting, and 0.83?±?0.67 and 0.63?±?0.44 degrees during canter. Conclusions Angle values calculated with IMU data showed acceptable accuracy consistency for quantification of flexion-extension movement in a horse's back. These results are encouraging for future development of the method in real-life situations where mocap systems are unsuited for the quantification of back movements.

AB  - Introduction Requirements of competitive dressage should be reviewed periodically to inform training of horses and judges. The aim of this study was to determine whether features of the FEI definition of piaffe are achieved in competition and to correlate the judges? scores with the degree of conformity to the definition. Methods Videography (60?Hz) of 3 piaffe strides (performed at marker D within a field of view 6?x?4?m) from 60 Grand Prix horses was used to measure croup height (CH), poll height (PH), the highest point of the neck (PN), peak height of the fore (FTpeak) and hindlimb toe (HTpeak), the level of a point half way down the cannon (MC) and the level of the fetlock joint (FJ) to within?±?0.01?m. Paired t-tests were used to compare CH in piaffe with that in halt, PH with PN, FTpeak with MC and HTpeak with FJ during piaffe to determine if the criteria within the definition were met. Piaffe scores from 5 judges were obtained from a subset of 17 horses. Results CH was higher in piaffe than in halt (P<0.001). PN was higher than PH in piaffe (P?=?0.001). FTpeak was lower than MC (P?=?0.001) and HTpeak was lower than FJ (P?=?0.001). There was no significant difference (P?=?0.836) between the scores awarded to each horse but also no correlation between the scores and PH (P?=?0.331), CH (P?=?0.829), FTpeak (P?=?0.784) or HTpeak (P?=?0.924). Conclusions Piaffe performed in competition does not conform to the FEI definition of the movement although judges? scores appear consistent. This finding suggests that the definition of the movement or judge training should be reviewed. Ethical Animal Research Project approved by Hartpury College Research Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Numerous oral joint supplements are available, but there is limited research into their efficacy. This study evaluated the effect of an oral joint supplement on orthopaedic evaluation scores and limb kinematics in horses. Methods 24 mature horses (71% 1?4/10 lame) were included. Exclusions were poor body condition, health problems, or lameness >4/10. Supplement S (FlexAbilityTM, Science Supplements, containing chondroitin sulphate 162?g/kg, glucosamine 190?g/kg, vitamin C 80?g/kg, methyl sulphonyl methane 256?g/kg, DHA 66?g/kg); EPA 34?g/kg; or placebo P (carrier/flavours only) were fed to horses for 21 days each in a random order triple-blind crossover design. Horses were evaluated at day 0 (baseline), 21 (after first treatment) and 42 (after second treatment). Clinical orthopaedic evaluation for straight line and lungeing circle (walk and trot), and during ridden exercise (walk, trot and canter) was performed. Side-view high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) determined midstance tarsal flexion, carpal extension and fetlock extension for straight line trotting. All evaluators were blinded to treatment. Effect of treatment, sequence, limb and interactions were investigated using linear mixed models. Results S was associated with significantly lower lameness grade in a straight line (P?=?0.001) with individual horses improving up to 2/10 grades and circle (P?=?0.010) than either P or baseline. For horses with hindlimb lameness, supplement S was associated with significantly greater tarsal flexion than baseline (4.2% greater, P<0.02) or P (2.7% greater, P<0.037). Conclusions Oral administration of supplement S was associated with less lameness than P or baseline. Increased midstance tarsal flexion of lame limbs may indicate improved mobility or comfort during peak loading.

AB  - Introduction Pressure plate analysis has been limited to measurements on a hard surface, whereas horses routinely perform on a soft substrate. Methods Five sound unshod ponies were walked and trotted over a pressure plate under 2 different conditions: first, the plate was covered with a 5-mm rubber mat, and then with an additional 50-mm layer of sand/synthetic fibres. Peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), peak vertical pressure (PVP), contact area (CA) and stance duration (ST) were obtained. Toe-heel and medio-lateral hoof balance curves of the vertical force were calculated (126?Hz). Hard vs. soft surfaces were compared using ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons. Results PVF, VI, PVP and ST decreased on the soft substrate, while CA increased (P<0.001). At impact, there was more even load distribution between the toe and heel region on the soft vs. hard surface, both at walk (P<0.001) and trot (P?=?0.039), and between the lateral and medial zone at walk (P?=?0.006), but not at trot. At mid-stance, there was more loading of the toe region on the soft vs. hard surface at walk (P?=?0.044) and at trot (P?=?0.005), while the medial and lateral zone were loaded equally. Conclusions The differences observed may be due to dampening effects, measurement errors or gait adaptations. Due to the lack of simultaneous force plate data this cannot be definitively identified, but the first option seems most likely. This study opens perspectives for evaluation of the effects of conformational deficits and therapeutic farriery on hoof loading in relation to arena composition.

AB  - Introduction Manipulation of the equine ilium and sacrum is utilised to assess range of motion at the SIJ. Motion of the ilium and sacrum during manual force application to the equine pelvis has been measured previously in vitro. The aim of this study was to measure the amount and direction of motion in vivo including comparison of bone fixated and skin mounted sensors. Methods Orientation sensors were skin-mounted over tuber sacrale (TS) and 3rd sacral spinous process (SP) of six standing Thoroughbred horses. Orientations of each TS and sacrum were recorded by one investigator during six trials of manual force applied to the pelvis, inducing cranial, caudal and oblique rotations. The study was repeated with the sensors mounted onto pins implanted into TS and SP. Mean values were reported in Euler angles for the three orthogonal planes lateral bend (LB), flexion-extension (F-E) and axial rotation (AR). Correlation between skin and bone fixated markers (Spearman R) was determined with significance set at P<0.05. Results The largest mean values recorded during rotations applied to the pelvises were for F-E (2.08?±?0.35o) with bone fixated sensors. Axial rotation gave the largest values recorded with skin-mountings (1.70?±?0.48o). There was poor correlation between skin-mounted and bone implanted markers. Conclusions Bony kinematics during external movement applied to the pelvis cannot be predicted from skin-mounted sensors, due to differences between skin- and bone-mounted sensors. Manipulation of the equine pelvis can be expected to produce motion in the plane of F-E, but axial movement should be interpreted with caution due to the potential effects of skin motion.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the trot may occur or increase during endurance rides due to lameness, pain or fatigue. By visual inspection of the movement it is difficult for veterinarians, riders and researchers to distinguish between fatigue and low-grade lameness, which make objective movement analysis relevant for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine changes in movement symmetry during long-term exercise. Methods Movement symmetry of 45 horses finishing endurance rides of 120?160 kilometres was determined by tri-axial accelerometry according to an earlier published method. Data was collected in Denmark and Germany from 5 international competitions between 2011 and 2013. Movement was assessed at trot on a straight-line in-hand on the day before the race and 30?mins to 3?hrs after passing the final veterinary examination. An overall symmetry index S was calculated on the basis of trunk accelerations measured at 240?Hz during 8 strides. All trotting sequences were recorded on videotape. A paired t-test was performed comparing symmetry indices before and after racing for each individual horse. Results A significant decrease in post-ride symmetry was detected (P?=?0.0042). This is seen as a lower S-index before racing (-6.18; SD?=?0.86. CI [-6.427; ?5.923]) compared to after racing (-5.67; SD?=?0.79; CI [-5.908; ?5.434]). Conclusions This study indicates that the biomechanical method applied allows quantification of the symmetry of movement during field conditions. Most horses had decreased movement symmetry after the race. Accordingly the study provides the basis for further investigation of the causes, including surface, climate and fitness; and the possible health consequences of asymmetric movement developed during long-term exercise. Ethical Animal Research The study was pre-approved by the FEI, the local organizing committees, ground jury, and Danish riding association (DRF). Participation was voluntary and the owner or rider signed an informed consent. All information regarding the horses is kept confidential and the horses coded for anonymity.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Previous research suggests stalling may have a negative influence on bone mineral content (BMC). Yet slow, long-distance exercise has not been successful in improving BMC compared to free-choice exercise. Still, it is a common practice to stall horses with light exercise and minimal turnout. We hypothesized stalled horses, despite ?weekend? turnout and light exercise, would have lower estimated BMC compared to pasture turnout. Methods Thirteen mature horses were split into two groups, Control (C, n?=?6) and Stalled (S, n?=?7). Digital radiographs were taken of the third metacarpal for estimation of BMC by radiographic bone aluminum equivalence (RBAE). After a 42-d period (P1) additional radiographs were taken and S-horses stalled for 4-d (receiving light under-saddle exercise), followed by 72-h pasture turnout. This pattern repeated for an additional 42-d (P2) followed by radiographs. Radiographs were analyzed for optical density of bone cortices and total BMC compared to an aluminum step-wedge on each cassette. Changes in BMC were analyzed using PROC mixed in SAS with repeated measures. Results No treatment differences were observed in the medial (P?=?0.72) or lateral (P?=?0.46) cortices. Dorsal and palmar cortices exhibited a treatment by period interaction (P<0.01, P<0.02), remaining unchanged in C but S decreased over P1 and returned to baseline in P2. Total RBAE was not different by treatment or period. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, horses stalled with light exercise and ?weekend? turnout maintained BMC compared to themselves and controls at pasture. Such management may be considered for maintaining BMC when horses must be stalled for weekday riding or training. Further research is necessary to determine minimum turnout and exercise needs to maintain BMC when stalling.

AB  - Introduction One of the causes of injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is assumed to be repeated high intensity loading of the tendon. Earlier fatigue of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) in comparison to the time of fatigue of the superficial digital flexor muscle (SDFM) is also assumed to increase load on the SDFT during long distance running. This study evaluated the fatigue of SDFM and DDFM with maximal exercise. Methods Two wire electrodes were inserted into the SDFM and DDFM of 6 Thoroughbred horses (461?557?kg). Electromyogram (EMG) and hoof strain gauge signals were recorded at 2,500?Hz with horses on an inclined treadmill (6%), and filter processing was applied (high-pass 10?Hz for EMG and low-pass 200?Hz for strain gauge). Integrated EMG (iEMG), the median frequency (MF) of EMG, and the stride frequency (SF) were compared using paired t-test during 100?105% heart rate max exercise and trotting before and after maximal exercise. Results The SF significantly decreased and iEMG of SDFM tended to decrease during maximal exercise (P?=?0.055), while MF of EMG in SDFM and DDFM did not change. The iEMG of SDFM and DDFM significantly decreased and MF of EMG in DDFM tended to decrease at a trot after maximal exercise (P?=?0.063). Conclusions The DDFM may fatigue earlier than SDFM during long distance running. Further study is needed to evaluate the relationship between the decrease in iEMG of SDFM and DDFM during maximal exercise and the injury to SDFT.

AB  - Introduction Selecting the appropriate nutritional supplements for performance horses is difficult, due to significant gaps in the current scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that nutritional supplements are chosen based on owner's perception of discipline specific health and performance problems. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites, to collect data on demographics of owners and their horses, supplements used, and their opinion on health and performance problems in their discipline, and in their own horses. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Sign and Fisher's exact tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 599 responses met the inclusion criteria, of which 441 were or had competed in dressage, and 158 in eventing (unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced levels). Participants had been riding for 26.4 (3?60) (mean (range)) years, currently competed 1.2 (0?10) horses, and used 2 (0?12) supplements in their top horse. Participants ranked the most important health and performance issues as (1) Energy and behaviour, (2) Lameness, (3) Back and muscle problems for dressage, and (1) Lameness, (2) Energy and behaviour, (3) Stamina and fitness for eventing horses. The most common reason supplements were used in individual horses were (1) Joints and mobility, (2) Behavioural problems for dressage, and (1) Electrolytes, (2) Joints and mobility for eventing. Conclusions There was discrepancy between participants' opinions of the main health and performance problems within their discipline, and their reasons for using supplements.

AB  - Summary Background Decline in high speed treadmill (HSTM) exercise testing may be attributed to the rise of over-ground endoscopy and telemetric electrocardiography, in addition to concerns of adverse events during treadmill exercise resulting in injury or inadequate testing. Objectives To describe adverse events occurring during HSTM exercise tests at a single institution and determine their effect on likelihood of completing diagnostic HSTM exercise testing. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Pearson?s chi-square test was used to determine if a significant difference in frequencies of adverse events existed between complete and incomplete HSTM exercise tests. Two Firth logistic regression models were used to determine likelihood of exercise test completion given the presence of any adverse event, and the likelihood of exercise test completion for each type of adverse event. Results The majority of horses presenting for HSTM evaluation underwent exercise testing (900/1003; 90%). Eight-hundred and seven (90%) exercise tests were completed. Adverse events occurred in 136 (15%) HSTM exercise tests of which 97 (71%) did not impact ability to complete HSTM testing. Adverse events significantly but variably decreased the likelihood of HSTM exercise test completion. Sixty-six percent of incomplete exercise tests were prematurely terminated due to poor performance abnormalities during which diagnosis of poor performance cause(s) was still achieved. Main limitations Variable personnel recorded data over the study period. Per-test rather than per-horse evaluation does not account for the effect of multiple training and testing episodes performed in the same horse. Conclusions This study supports the continued usage of HSTM exercise testing for examination of horses with poor performance, with adverse events occurring infrequently. Adverse events reduced the likelihood of completing HSTM exercise testing although not all adverse events affected likelihood of completion similarly. In many cases, a performance limiting problem was identified for horses in which an exercise test was considered incomplete. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting information

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: F2-isoprostanes have been used extensively to quantify lipid peroxidation in association with risk factors in various diseases. Horses with colic may have intestinal ischaemia and/or inflammation characterised by oxidative stress and increased production of isoprostanes. Objectives: To gather preliminary data regarding the feasibility of using urine F2-isoprostanes and isoprostane metabolites as early screening tools for the presence of gastrointestinal disease requiring surgical intervention in horses and ultimately develop a stall-side test capable of identifying these horses as early as possible for timely referral. Methods: Concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were determined by mass spectroscopy and normalised to urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in urine samples from 42 healthy control horses and 43 horses with gastrointestinal pain or colic. Results: Horses with colic were treated medically (n = 21) or surgically (n = 22). Mean ± s.d. concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were significantly higher in horses with colic (2.94 ± 1.69 and 0.31 ± 0.22?ng/mg Cr, respectively), compared to control horses (1.89 ± 1.39 and 0.22 ± 0.08?ng/mg Cr, respectively). Mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in horses undergoing surgery (0.38 ± 0.28?ng/mg Cr) compared to controls and medical colics (0.26 ± 0.11?ng/mg Cr). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations (0.47 ± 0.39?ng/mg Cr) than control or surviving colic horses (0.29 ± 0.24?ng/mg Cr). Conclusions: Measurement of urine isoprostane metabolite concentration may be a useful prognostic indicator in equine colic. Potential relevance: Urine isoprostane metabolites may aid in early recognition of surgical colic. Isoprostanes are a potential therapeutic target to prevent further systemic and gastrointestinal tissue injury in horses with colic.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries.

AB  - Introduction Poor hoof angle and hoof pastern alignment has been linked to lameness in mature horses. External characteristics, such as the hoof pastern axis and hoof angle, are commonly used to assess dorsopalmar conformation in the same manner in foals. The hoof wall integument and distal phalanx is parallel in healthy mature horses but not in foals: this is not understood. Methods The front feet of 22 Thoroughbred foals were radiographed and measured in June and again in November. Lateromedial radiographic images were measured (Osirix) for hoof integument angle and width, and proximal, middle and distal phalanx angles. The data were tabulated in Excel and analysed in Minitab. After assessment for normality (Anderson-Darling), potential relationships were assessed for differences between June and November using paired t-tests and regression analysis. Results The dorsal hoof angle became more acute with age, R2?=?0.3326, the mean of June, 59.05?±?3.662°, was significantly different from November, 53.64?±?2.7824°, P<0.0001. The hoof pastern axes were broken forward in June, 6.1?±?2.1°, in November 2.5?±?1.6°, whereas the phalangeal axes were broken back, June,-11.0?±?7.5°, November, ?8.3?±?4.4°. There was a significant relationship between age and hoof pastern axis alignment, R2?=?0.3746; P<0.0001. The phalangeal axis did not correlate with age. The relationship between age and parallelism of the integument was significant R2?=?0.4867; P<0.0001. Conclusions The cause of the non-alignment of the hoof pastern axis and phalangeal axis in Thoroughbred foals is widening of hoof integument proximodistally and circumferential bone thickening of the distal phalanx. Assumptions of phalangeal angles based on external characteristics cannot be made in foals.

AB  - Introduction Myofascial lines are chains of interconnected anatomical structures that functionally direct the basic motion patterns of the musculoskeletal system. They have previously been dissected in humans, where they describe the overall spinal motion of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and axial rotation. They are believed to play a role in functionality, connection, and balance of the body. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar myofascial lines could be identified in the horse. Methods Five myofascial kinetic lines were dissected in 22 horses euthanized for unrelated reasons. The lines were the Superficial Dorsal Line (SDL), Superficial Ventral Line (SVL), Lateral Line (LL), Spiral Line (SL), and Functional Line (FL). Results SDL included hind limb flexors and the errector spinae group, which extend the hip and spine. SVL included hind limb extensors, abdominal muscles, and ventral neck muscles, which are structures with antagonistic functions to SDL. LL followed myofascial tissues along the side of the abdomen and produced latero-flexion of the spine. FL and SL formed helical lines concerned with spinal axial rotation. FL connected the front limb to the contralateral hind limb by crossing over the midline at the thoraco-lumbar level dorsal and ventral on the trunk. SL connected one side of the neck with the contralateral front limb and ipsilateral hind limb by a helical course around the body crossing over at the cervico-thoracic and lumbo-sacral junctions. Conclusions The SBL, SVL and LL complete a functional anatomical ring, which balances the dorsal, ventral and lateral motion patterns of the horse. The helical FL and SL determine the spinal axial rotation. With minor exceptions all lines mirrored the human lines.

AB  - Introduction Racing Quarter Horses (QH) typically compete at shorter distances and faster speeds than Thoroughbreds (Tbred). The two components of speed are stride rate and stride length. The hypothesis of this study is that racing QH have greater stride rates than Tbreds, and that stride rate decreases as distance increases, even within breed. Methods Five runnings of sprint and classic distance stakes races for both QH (Texas Twister Stakes, 100.6?m; Champion of Champions, 402.3?m) and Tbred (Breeders? Cup Sprint, 1,207.0?m; Breeders? Cup Classic, 2,011.7?m) contested from 2008 to 2012 were obtained and viewed by five individuals. Individuals watched each race three times (in slow motion when needed) and the average number of strides per second taken by the winning horse was calculated. Using the PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS, the averages from the five individuals were used to compare differences between breeds, and between distances within a breed. The stride rates were also used to determine average stride length by factoring in length of each race. Results The average stride rate was greater for QH than for Tbred (2.88 vs 2.34 strides/sec; P<0.0001). Additionally, stride rate decreased (P<0.0001) as distance increased (2.96, 2.81, 2.45, 2.23 strides/sec, respectively). Stride length was longest in the Tbred races and shortest in the 100.6?m QH race (P<0.0001). Conclusions The Tbred stride rates reported here, and associated respiratory rates, have been previously reported and are remarkable. However, QH rates are nearly 25% greater. The associated rapid acceleration and deacceleration of the lower limb and quick breathing rate may have implications for skeletal and respiratory soundness.

AB  - Introduction The fixation of the bridle, particularly the noseband, is important in the horse-rider interaction. The goal of this study was to show the influence of noseband tightness on tensile forces elicited in side reins under traction to position the horse's head. Methods Ten Warmblood horses (2 mares, 8 geldings; mean age: 12.4?±?5.3 years) were assessed during walk and trot on a treadmill. Side reins were used to position the horse's head so that the nose was nearly vertical. Measurements were made with a correctly tightened noseband (two fingers space between the noseband and nasal bone?=?N1) and with a tight noseband (=?N2). Rein forces were measured with an electronic sensor based on a force sensing resistor (27?g, sample rate 120?Hz, Interlink Electronics corp.), synchronized with a kinematic system (10 cameras, 120?Hz, Motion Analysis corp.). The force sensors were calibrated with masses of 1?Kg (=9.81?N) and 4?Kg (=39.24?N). Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS. Normality of data was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results Side rein forces in N1 were significantly higher than in N2 during walk and trot. Maximum forces at walk were 8.6?±?0.9?N for N1 and 6.7?±?0.95?N for N2. At trot the forces (7.2?±?0.95?N for N1; 5.96?±?0.9?N N2) were significantly reduced compared to walk. There was no significant difference between left and right rein forces. Conclusions This study demonstrated that noseband tightness has an influence on rein tension. The rein forces that were exerted were lower than in ridden horses.

AB  - Introduction Suspensory apparatus injuries are common in dressage horses. Studies demonstrate that surface type affects hoof forces and distal limb kinematics of equine athletes. Because synthetic race surfaces have lower stiffness and limb loads than dirt surfaces, it was hypothesized that dressage horses have less fetlock hyperextension on a synthetic surface than a dirt surface. Methods Two-dimensional, high-speed videos (250?Hz, 2?ppcm) of 6 dressage horses (ages 8?13; 5 males, 1 female) during extended trot on dirt and synthetic surfaces (6 trials (strides) per horse per surface) were digitized (low-pass Butterworth filter, 15?Hz). Fetlock and solar hoof angles determined from skin and hoof markers were compared between surfaces using a mixed model ANCOVA that accounted for horse velocity (saddle billet marker) and repeated horse measures. Surface mechanical behaviors were characterized using a track testing device. Maximum force, time to maximum force, maximum displacement, resting rebound, maximum vertical rebound, average stiffness, and maximum load rate were compared between surfaces and time of day (morning, afternoon) using a general linear model ANOVA. Results Maximum and toe off fetlock angles were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt (??=?2°, P?=?0.070). Mean maximum fetlock angle on the synthetic surface was 260°. The maximum load rate of the synthetic surface was 5 times greater than the dirt surface (P?=?0.0086). Conclusions Synthetic surfaces were designed to reduce injuries in equine athletes. Because suspensory apparatus elongation is largely dependent on fetlock extension, it is possible that suspensory apparatus strain is greater on synthetic surfaces. Thus, surface design may require more refinement to promote injury prevention based on horse discipline and gait.
