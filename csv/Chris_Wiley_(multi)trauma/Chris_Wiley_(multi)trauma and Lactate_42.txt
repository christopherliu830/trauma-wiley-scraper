AB  - ABSTRACT In fracture treatment, several adverse effects of metal, especially its excessive rigidity, often require the removal of the implants after a fracture has healed. Recent research with biodegradable polymers has contributed to the development of totally biodegradable polylactic acid implants with very high initial bending and shear strengths, but a modulus of elasticity comparable to that of bone. These implants were originally intended for use in fractures involving cancellous bone. Encouraging results from treating experimentally produced diaphyseal fractures led the authors to use these implants in a clinical trial on shaft fractures in dogs and cats. In this study, a total of 11 dogs and 14 cats had 28 diaphyseal fractures treated with one or several intramedullary pins of self-reinforced left isomeric polylactic acid. Of the 25 treated cases, 23 healed. Four of these had an unsatisfactory end result attributed to the implants used and one developed an osteomyelitis. Thus, out of 25 fractures, 23 united (92 per cent] and 18 [72 per cent) had a good or excellent outcome.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary Iliac arteriovenous fistulas are an uncommon condition, which may be spontaneous or traumatic in nature. Such fistulas classically present with a triad of high-output cardiac failure, pulsatile abdominal mass with a bruit and unilateral leg ischaemia or venous congestion. We describe a case of an iliocaval fistula secondary to rupture of a common iliac artery aneurysm, with an unusual presentation of multiple organ failure, masquerading as sepsis. We describe the CT findings of iliocaval fistula, which was the means of diagnosis in this study.

AB  - An axial pattern flap based on the superficial brachial artery and vein (brachial axial pattern flap) was developed on the forelimbs of five dogs. The flap was immediately transferred to a distal cutaneous defect created on the antebrachium of that limb. A control flap was elevated on the opposite limb and transferred to a similar distal site after ligation of the superficial brachial artery and vein at the base of the flap. Mean brachial axial pattern flap survival (98%) was significantly more than mean control flap survival (77%) (p < 0.05). Results of this study suggest that the brachial axial pattern flap has potential application for closure of major cutaneous defects involving the canine antebrachium above the carpus.

AB  - Summary Multi-factorial causes jeopardize brain integrity in ?-thalassaemia. Intracranial parenchymal and vascular changes have been reported among young ?-thalassaemia patients but conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are contradictory making early MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)/venography monitoring a matter of debate. This study prospectively investigated 75 neurologically asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients (mean-age 35·2 ± 10·7 years; 52/75 transfusion-dependent; 41/75 splenectomised) using a 3T magnetic resonance scanner; clinical, laboratory and treatment data were also collected. White matter ischaemic-like abnormalities, intracranial artery stenoses, aneurysms and sinus venous thrombosis were compared between patients and 56 healthy controls (mean-age 33·9 ± 10·8 years). No patient or control showed silent territorial or lacunar strokes, intracranial artery stenoses or signs of sinus thrombosis. White matter lesions were found both in patients (35/75, 46·7%) and controls (28/56, 50·0%), without differences in terms of number (4·0 ± 10·6 vs. 4·6 ± 9·1, P = 0·63), size and Fazekas? Score. Intracranial aneurysms did not differ between patients and controls for incidence rate (7/75, 9·3% vs. 5/56, 8·9%), size and site. Vascular and parenchymal abnormality rate did not differ according to treatments or clinical phenotype. According to this study, asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients treated according to current guidelines do not seem to carry an increased risk of brain and intracranial vascular changes, thus weakening recommendations for regular brain MRI monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to standardized noxious stimulation during its co-administration with fentanyl at three different doses by constant rate infusion (CRI) intravenously (IV) in goats. Study design Prospective, blinded, randomized crossover, experimental. Animals Eight healthy goats; four does and four wethers. Methods For induction of anaesthesia, a bolus of fentanyl was administered at 0.005 mg kg?1 (LFent), 0.015 mg kg?1 (MFent) or 0.03 mg kg?1 (HFent) followed by alfaxalone at 2.0 mg kg?1. For maintenance, the goats received alfaxalone at an initial infusion rate of 9.6 mg kg?1 hour?1 and one of three fentanyl treatments: 0.005 mg kg?1 hour?1(LFent), 0.015 mg kg?1 hour?1 (MFent) or 0.03 mg kg?1 hour?1 (HFent). The MIR of alfaxalone was determined during fentanyl CRI by testing for responses to stimulation (clamping on a digit with Vulsellum forceps) every 30 minutes. Some cardiopulmonary parameters were measured. Results The alfaxalone MIR median (range) was 6.7 (6.7?8.6), 2.9 (1.0?6.7) and 1.0 (1.0?4.8) mg kg?1 hour?1 during LFent, MFent and HFent, respectively. Alfaxalone MIR was significantly lower during MFENT and HFENT compared to LFENT. Significantly low oxygen haemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), observed 2 minutes into anaesthesia after all fentanyl treatments, were the most remarkable adverse cardiopulmonary effects observed. Recovery from anaesthesia was severely affected by high doses of fentanyl with excitatory behavioural signs predominant for up to 2 hours post-administration after MFent and HFent. Conclusions and clinical relevance Fentanyl reduces alfaxalone MIR in goats in a dose-dependent manner. Immediate oxygen supplementation after induction of general anaesthesia is recommended to prevent hypoxaemia. Doses of fentanyl equal to or greater than 0.015 mg kg?1 hour?1 tend to be associated with severe excitatory behaviour and should be avoided when fentanyl is administered to goats.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the potential of an intravenous (IV) sevoflurane formulation for maintenance of general anesthesia in dogs. Study design Prospective crossover design. Animals Six healthy, mature, mixed-breed dogs, four males and two females, weighing 11.7 ± 3.4 kg. Methods Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol IV for instrumentation. Baseline measurements were recorded before administration of either sevoflurane in oxygen (Sevo-Inh) or lipid-emulsified sevoflurane 8% v/v in 30% Intralipid IV (Sevo-E), 0.5 mL kg?1 over 5 minutes followed by an infusion at 0.1?0.3 mL kg?1 minute?1. Dogs were breathing spontaneously. The ?up-and-down? technique was used to determine the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane. Over 120 minutes, a tail clamp was applied every 15 minutes and sevoflurane administration was adjusted depending on the response. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration and variables were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes: heart rate (HR), systemic arterial pressure (sAP), respiratory rate (fR), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), arterial pH and blood gases, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Results There were no significant differences between treatments for HR, sAP, fR, SaO2, and biochemical variables (p > 0.05). pH and were significantly decreased, and PaCO2 increased from baseline in Sevo-E (p < 0.05). MAC was significantly lower for Sevo-E than for Sevo-Inh, although the required dose of sevoflurane (g hour?1) to maintain general anesthesia was not significantly different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Administration of 8% v/v sevoflurane lipid emulsion IV was effective in maintaining general anesthesia in dogs, but resulted in moderate cardiopulmonary depression, metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The amount of sevoflurane (g hour?1) required to maintain general anesthesia was significantly lower for inhaled than for IV sevoflurane.

AB  - Summary.? Although up to 30% of babies born with haemophilia do not have a family history of the disorder, the remaining 70% are born in families where haemophilia has been diagnosed. It has been estimated that for each male with haemophilia, there are five potential female carriers. Such women will benefit from knowledge of both their genetic (mutation present or not) and phenotype (level of plasma factor activity) status. Genetic counselling services to provide information and testing, together with plasma factor measurement, should be offered where available to all women at risk of being carriers. It is critical that women know their plasma factor measurement as they may have mild haemophilia (factor 5?30%, reference range 50?150%) which requires management at times of medical and surgical procedures and following trauma. Close liaison between adult and paediatric haemophilia centres and obstetric?gynaecology units is important to ensure that clinical carers identify and address carriers? needs. Genetic testing should be performed only after a potential carrier has been counselled and supported to receive such information. There is no coercion to accept such testing. An advantage of genetic testing is to then discuss pre-implantation genetic diagnosis which is an ex-viro form of prenatal diagnosis. This can assist couples at risk of having a child with haemophilia who wish to reduce their anxieties about reproduction. Approximately 4% of boys with haemophilia, born in countries with good maternal care, will have intracranial haemorrhage in the neonatal period. There are no high-level evidence-based guidelines for the management of delivery or of the newborn with haemophilia. Obstetricians or other birth attendants need to be advised of the possibility of delivery of a boy with haemophilia and seek support from a haemophilia specialist during the pregnancy. The mother can then be monitored and plans for delivery be developed between her medical consultants and discussed with her. It is always preferable for a carrier to know of her genetic and phenotypic status before becoming pregnant so that she is informed as to her options and requirements for safe delivery.

AB  - Five centimeter segments of the linea alba in mature, female, mixed breed dogs were incised and then approximated with either stainless steel fascial staples or size 0 polypropylene suture material. Breaking strength of the linea alba closures was determined at 0 (Phase I, 18 dogs) and at 7,14, and 31 days (Phase II, 18 dogs). Histology and videointeractive planar morphometry were used to evaluate healing of the linea alba. Breaking strength and histologic and morphometric variables were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance in a split plot design. In a clinical trial, 20 cm linea alba incisions were approximated with stainless steel fascial staples after elective ovariohysterectomy in mature, female, mixed breed dogs (Phase III, eight dogs). The dogs were evaluated at 1, 2, 7,14, 31, 90, and 180 days. Linea alba incisions approximated with polypropylene suture material were significantly stronger than linea alba incisions approximated with stainless steel fascial staples on day 0. There was no significant difference between breaking strength values, histologic, and morphometric appearance of linea alba incisions closed with stainless steel fascial staples or polypropylene suture material when compared 7,14, and 31 days after surgery. All of the dogs in the clinical trial appeared to be normal at all evaluation times. Approximation of linea alba incisions with stainless steel fascial staples compares favorably to closure with a simple continuous pattern of polypropylene suture material with regard to breaking strength, clinical, histologic, and morphometric appearance.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the influence of a low dose dexmedetomidine infusion on the nociceptive withdrawal reflex and temporal summation in dogs during isoflurane anaesthesia. Study design? Prospective experimental blinded cross-over study. Animals? Eight healthy mixed breed dogs, body weight Mean?±?SD 26.5?±?8.4?kg and age 25?± 16 months. Methods? Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane (Fe?ISO 1.3%) delivered in oxygen and air. After stabilization, baseline recordings (time 0) were obtained, then a dexmedetomidine bolus (1??g?kg?1 IV) followed by a continuous rate infusion (1??g?kg?1?hour?1) or saline placebo were administered. At times 10, 30 and 60?minutes after the initial bolus, electrical stimulations of increasing intensity were applied over the lateral plantar digital nerve, and administered both as single and as repeated stimuli. The resulting reflex responses were recorded using electromyography. Data were analysed using a multivariable linear regression model and a Kruskal Wallis test for single stimulation data, and repeated measures anova and paired t-test for repeated stimulation data. Results? The AUC for the stimulus-response curves after single stimulation were similar for both treatments at time 0. At times 10, 30 and 60 the AUCs for the stimulus-response curves were significantly lower with dexmedetomidine treatment than with placebo. Temporal summation was evident in both treatments at times 0, 10, 30 and 60 starting from a stimulation intensity of 10?mA. The magnitude of temporal summation was smaller in dexmedetomidine than in placebo treated dogs at time 10, 30 and 60, but not at time 0. Conclusions? During isoflurane anaesthesia, low dose dexmedetomidine suppresses the nociceptive reflex responses after single and repeated electrical stimulation. Clinical relevance? This experimental study confirms previous reports on its peri-operative efficacy under clinical conditions, and further indicates that dexmedetomidine might reduce the risk of post-operative chronic pain development.

AB  - Olfactory bulb lesions were diagnosed in four dogs presented for generalized seizure disorders. Surgery was performed on each dog using a transfrontal craniotomy. A free fascial-fat graft was used to cover the dural defect resulting from surgery. No major complications were observed during the immediate postoperative period. The histopathologic diagnosis in each case was meningioma. Generalized seizures recurred in all dogs, and three dogs were euthanized for this reason from 9 to 29 weeks postoperatively. One dog was euthanized 12 weeks after surgery due to pancreatitis and pneumonia. Necropsy showed that two dogs had recurrent olfactory bulb meningiomas, one dog had a meningioma of the opposite olfactory bulb, and one dog was tumor free.

AB  - Summary We examined the relationship in horses between osmotic fragility of erythrocytes (OFE) measured as the red cell haemolysis rates (HLR) in 0.56% NaCl and certain physiological characters. Animals were exercised on a treadmill: warmed up at 30% V?O2max for 5 min or at 105% V?O2max for 1 min, given an exercise test at 80 or 105% V?O2max until fatigued, and then cooled down. The pH and temperature of the blood had a significant correlation for the HLR: r = 0.93 and 0.92 (P<.01) on arterial and mixed venous blood, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, heart rate and packed cell volume showed lower coefficients for the HLR. The present study suggested that, in exercising horses, 1) the increase of blood flow and release of erythrocytes from the spleen into the circulation have little effect on changes of OFE; 2) the decrease of blood pH promotes OFE; 3) the increase of the pH causes osmotic resistance in the cells and 4) an increase of blood temperature during exercise is associated with the decrease in the OFE.

AB  - Summary Bright green inclusions in neutrophils have been reported as a sign of impending patient death. Here we report a series of 20 patients in whom green inclusions were identified in neutrophils or monocytes. Thirteen (65%) of the patients died within days of the detection of the inclusions. A common feature to almost all patients was ischaemic or hypoxic hepatitis which, in fatal cases, was associated with lactic acidosis. Light and electron microscopy indicated that the inclusions were lipid-rich, probably derived from lipofuscin-like material released from necrotic liver parenchymal cells. The majority of patients were known to be seriously ill at the time of detection of neutrophil inclusions. We recommend that the detection of green inclusions, which we refer to as ?critical green inclusions?, is acknowledged and reported by laboratories and correlated with clinical findings.

AB  - Summary The pharmacological mechanisms of nontraditional analgesic agents are diverse and are the focus of much current research activity. This chapter reviews nontraditional analgesics, and is arranged according to currently accepted pharmacological mechanisms. Since the 1960s, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including carbamazepine, gabapentin, and pregabalin, have been used to manage neuropathic pain in human patients. Gabapentin has received the most attention as a nontraditional analgesic in veterinary medicine, and the chapter focuses on the gabapentinoids. There are many drugs in current use that have antagonist activity at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, including ketamine and tiletamine, amantadine, dextromethorphan, nitrous oxide, xenon, and some opioids, including methadone. The chapter discusses ketamine and the oral NMDA antagonist amantadine, The neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) are fundamental to many central nervous system activities, including vigilance, hunger, mood, and nociception. Mounting evidence indicates that NE systems may influence analgesia to a greater degree than serotonin pathways.

AB  - Objective To investigate the ability of shape memory Dacron polymer vascular coils to induce the complete, gradual occlusion of the canine jugular vein. Study Design Observational pilot study. Animals Nine purpose-bred dogs. Methods Eighteen coils were deployed in nine dogs using fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous transvenous coil implantation. Individual coil formulations varied around a Dacron polymer base. Jugular vein diameter, percent vessel occlusion, and thrombus echogenicity were monitored at weekly intervals using ultrasonography. Affected jugular veins were harvested at 6 weeks post-implantation and histopathological analysis was performed to assess adventitial fibrosis, intimal layer thickening, and inflammation. Results Ten coils migrated from the jugular veins to the pulmonary vasculature within 0?2 weeks following implantation. Three jugular veins achieved at least 90% occlusion at six weeks. Histopathology of these jugular veins revealed marked perivascular thickening and fibrovascular proliferation, increased infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, and abundant fibroplasia. Conclusions Complete, gradual occlusion of a jugular vein was achieved in three dogs. Significant vessel wall reaction and inflammation can induce gradual vessel occlusion when a Dacron coil remains implanted within the jugular vein. Dacron polymer coils could be a feasible treatment option for the gradual occlusion of congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs using minimally invasive, percutaneous transvenous implantation.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.
