AB  - Objective To develop and describe a laparoscopic retroperitoneal access technique, investigate working space establishment, and describe the surgical anatomy in the retroperitoneal space as an initial step for clinical application of retroperitoneal laparoscopy in dogs. Study Design Cadaveric and experimental study. Animals Cadaveric (n=8) and healthy (n=6) adult dogs. Methods The retroperitoneal access technique was developed in 3 cadavers based on the human technique and transperitoneal observation. Its application and working space establishment with carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation alone was evaluated in 5 cadavers by observing with a transperitoneal telescope and in 6 live dogs by repeated computed tomography (CT) scans at pressure of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Recordings of retroperitoneoscopy as well as working space volume and linear dimensions measured on CT images were analyzed. Results Retroperitoneal access and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation alone were successfully performed in all 6 live dogs. The only complication observed was in 1 dog that developed subclinical pneumomediastinum. As pressure increased, working space was established from the ipsilateral to the contralateral side, and peritoneal tearing eventually developed. Working space volume increased significantly from 5 mmHg and linear dimensions increased significantly from 0 to 10 mmHg. With pneumo-retroperitoneum above 5 mmHg, retroperitoneal organs, including kidneys and adrenal glands, were easily visualized. Conclusion The retroperitoneal access technique and working space establishment with CO2 insufflation starting with 5 mmHg and increasing to 10 mmHg provided adequate working space and visualization of retroperitoneal organs, which may allow direct access for retroperitoneal laparoscopy in dogs.

AB  - This study was performed to determine the cardiovascular responses to isoflurane in euthyroid and hypothyroid dogs. Four healthy mixed-breed dogs were studied prior to thyroidectomy (PRE), 6 months after thyroidectomy (HYP), and after 2 months of oral supplementation with 1-thyroxine (SUP). Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (Q?), stroke volume (SV), systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were determined in awake dogs and in the same dogs when end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were 1.28%, 1.92%, and 2.56%. Ventilation was controlled in anesthetized dogs and Paco2 maintained between 38 to 42 mm Hg. Isoflurane caused significant (P <.05) dose-dependent reduction in Q?, SV, SAP, DAP, and MAP in the PRE, HYP, and SUP dogs. Cardiac output was lower in the HYP dogs than in the PRE or SUP dogs during awake measurement. TPR was increased in the awake HYP dogs compared with the PRE or SUP dogs. During anesthesia, HYP dogs tended to have lower Q?, SV, SAP, and MAP than the PRE or SUP groups, but the only significant reduction was SAP during 1.5 MAC. The cardiovascular responses to isoflurane in hypothyroid dogs are similar to euthyroid animals with a dose-dependent depression in Q?, SV, and arterial pressure.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Diarrhoea is the most common disease in young calves, accounting for about 50% of all calf deaths. The disease can be easily recognised and it is important that treatment is administered rapidly in order to maximise the chance of survival. However, equally important is a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of the disease and the implementation of appropriate management steps to minimise the impact of the disease in the future. This article discusses the most common causes of neonatal diarrhoea and seeks the advice of the panel on how best to treat and manage them.

AB  - Abstract The goal of the 2019 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Consensus Conference was to explore the current cultural and systemic issues in Emergency Medicine that impact the individual well-being of every emergency physician, and to make recommendations for future study. Burnout is epidemic in emergency medicine. Physician wellness is required to enhance patient clinical outcomes as well as to ensure professional satisfaction and longevity. For conference preparation, a consensus steering committee was created, and a decision was made to use the groundbreaking model of the National Academy of Medicine's ?Factors Affecting Clinician Well-Being and Resilience? to further identify areas of needed study. On May 14, 2019, the Wellness Consensus Conference was attended by over 50 faculty physicians from across the US. These attendees discussed key concepts and prior research presented by content experts. Groups of participants engaged in crowdsourcing techniques to consolidate ideas derived from those discussions. These consensus concepts were recorded and are presented within this article. A repetitive theme noted at the conference was the overwhelming effect of the system and organization factors on individual physician well-being. The concept of ongoing assessment of professional fulfillment over the lifespan of the emergency physician was felt to be crucial in guiding wellness and resilience interventions in a timely manner. Examining ways to enable physicians to flourish rather than experience burnout are strong future directions for study.

AB  - Abstract Objective  To investigate the influence of a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) in horses anaesthetized with isoflurane. Study design  Prospective, randomized, blinded, clinical study. Animals  Forty adult healthy horses (weight mean 491?±?SD 102?kg) undergoing elective surgery. Methods  After sedation [dexmedetomidine, 3.5 ??g ?kg?1 intravenously (IV)] and induction IV (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1, ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air (FiO2 55?60%). Horses were ventilated and dobutamine was administered when hypoventilation [arterial partial pressure of CO2?>?8.00?kPa (60?mmHg)] and hypotension [arterial pressure 70?mmHg] occurred respectively. During anaesthesia, horses were randomly allocated to receive a CRI of dexmedetomidine (1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1) (D) or saline (S). Monitoring included end-tidal isoflurane concentration, cardiopulmonary parameters, and need for dobutamine and additional ketamine. All horses received 0.875??g?kg?1 dexmedetomidine IV for the recovery period. Age and weight of the horses, duration of anaesthesia, additional ketamine and dobutamine, cardiopulmonary data (anova), recovery scores (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test), duration of recovery (t-test) and attempts to stand (Mann?Whitney test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results  Heart rate and arterial partial pressure of oxygen were significantly lower in group D compared to group S. An interaction between treatment and time was present for cardiac index, oxygen delivery index and systemic vascular resistance. End-tidal isoflurane concentration and heart rate significantly increased over time. Packed cell volume, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen content, stroke volume index and systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased over time. Recovery scores were significantly better in group D, with fewer attempts to stand and significantly longer times to sternal position and first attempt to stand. Conclusions and clinical relevance  A dexmedetomidine CRI produced limited cardiopulmonary effects, but significantly improved recovery quality.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the number and causes of deaths of Australian citizens who died overseas in a 12-month period. DesignRetrospective survey of deaths reported to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by Australian embassies, high commissions and consulates for the period July 1992 to June 1993. Data on Australians travelling overseas were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ResultsDuring the year 1992-1993, 2 299 500 Australians travelled overseas for less than 12 months (short term travellers), with an estimated mean trip duration of 6.3 weeks. Another 65 450 left for more than 12 months (long term travellers), and 27 910 left permanently (residents). Of the 421 recorded deaths, 289 were in short term travellers, 108 in long term travellers/residents and 24 in members of work parties. The annual crude mortality rate for short term travellers and work party members was estimated at about 0.1%. Men outnumbered women almost 4:1. Death rates increased with age, reflecting underlying medical problems in older travellers, with heart disease being the leading cause (146 deaths, 35%). Fatal trauma predominated in younger people. Accidents, mainly in traffic, accounted for 77 deaths (18%) and infections for 10 (2.4%), including two cases of malaria. Death rates varied between geographical regions, with New Zealand being the safest destination. ConclusionsThe risk of an Australian dying while travelling overseas is probably little different from that while staying home. The low level of fatal infections may result from preventive measures. Travellers should be aware of the danger of accidents, particularly traffic accidents, while overseas.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare pulmonary function and gas exchange in ponies during maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane or by a total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) technique. Study design Experimental, cross?over study. Animals Six healthy ponies weighing mean 286 (range 233?388) ± SD 61 kg, age 13 (9?16) ± 3 years. Methods The ponies were anaesthetized twice, a minimum of two weeks apart. Following sedation with romifidine [80 ?g kg?1 intravenously (IV)], anaesthesia was induced IV with midazolam (0.06 mg kg?1) and ketamine (2.5 mg kg?1), then maintained either with inhaled isoflurane (Fe?Iso = 1.1 vol%) (T-ISO) or an IV infusion of romifidine (120 ?g kg?1 hour?1), midazolam (0.09 mg kg?1 hour?1 IV) and ketamine (3.3 mg kg?1 hour?1) (T-TIVA). Ponies were placed in lateral recumbency. Breathing was spontaneous and Fi?O2 60%. After an instrumentation/stabilisation period of 30 minutes, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken simultaneously every 10 minutes for 60 minutes and analysed immediately. Oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) and venous admixture were calculated. Tidal volume (TV), minute volume (MV), respiratory rate (fR), packed cell volume (PCV), arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded. Data were analysed with mixed model anova (α = 0.05). Treatments were compared overall and at two selected time points (T30 and T60) using Bonferroni correction. Results Arterial and mixed venous partial pressures of O2 and CO2, and TV were significantly lower and MV and fR were higher in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Venous admixture did not differ between treatments. O2ER was significantly higher in T-TIVA. Mean arterial pressure was higher and HR was lower in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Conclusions and clinical relevance Whilst arterial CO2 was within an acceptable range during both protocols, the impairment of oxygenation was more pronounced with the T-TIVA evidenced by lower arterial and venous oxygen partial pressures.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the anaesthetic, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects of intramuscular (IM) medetomidine and ketamine administered alone or combined with morphine or tramadol, for orchiectomy in cats. Study design Randomised, blinded, prospective clinical study. Animals Thirty client-owned cats. Materials and methods Cats (n = 10 in each group) received a combination of medetomidine (60 ?gkg?1) and ketamine (10 mg kg?1) alone (MedK); combined with morphine (0.2 mg kg?1) (MedKM), or combined with tramadol (2 mg kg?1) (MedKT) IM. Time of induction, surgical and recovery events were recorded, and physiological parameters measured and recorded. Analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a composite scoring system and the von Frey mechanical threshold device, every hour from three to eight hours post-drug administration injection. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal?Wallis or Chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Results Median (IQR) induction and recovery times (minutes) were not significantly (p = 0.125) different between groups: 5.6 (2.7?8.0), 7.4 (5.1?9.6) and 8.0 (5.8?14.9) for induction and 128.5 (95.1?142.8), 166.4 (123.1?210.0) and 142.9 (123.4?180.2) for recovery, with MedK, MedKT and MedKM, respectively. Two cats (MedKM) required alfaxalone for endotracheal intubation. In all groups, three or four cats required additional isoflurane for surgery. Arterial oxygen tension overall (mean ± SD: 66 ± 2 mmHg) was low. Surgery resulted in increased systolic arterial blood pressure (p < 0.001), haemoglobin saturation (p < 0.001), respiratory (p = 0.003) and heart rates (p = 0.002). Pain scores did not differ significantly between groups. Von Frey responses decreased over time; changes over time varied by treatment (p < 0.001), MedK returning to baseline values more rapidly than MedKM and MedKT. No cat required rescue analgesics. Conclusion and clinical relevance All three protocols can provide adequate anaesthesia and analgesia for orchiectomy in cats. However, rescue intervention to maintain surgical anaesthesia may be required in some cats. Oxygen supplementation is advised.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center's clinical study for the application of the cultured dermal substitute (CDS) composed of hyaluronic acid and collagen spongy matrix with allogenic cultured fibroblasts1 is in progress since 2001. In this study, effect of the CDS for the treatment of fresh DDB wounds was tested. Methods: Six cases of second-degree burns, diagnosed as DDB by observation of blood stream of the dermal capillary using Compact Micro Vision System (Hi-Scope?, Hi Rox Co., Japan), were treated with the cultured allogenic fibroblasts, CDS. Results: The epithelialization of the wounds was obtained on 8.2?±?2.6 (mean?±?SD) days after the application. Conclusion: The results of our clinical experiences suggest that the allogenic cultured fibroblasts have beneficial effect on the wound healing of the DDB.

AB  - Summary This report describes two cases of successful surgical management of granulosa cell tumours (GCT) in mares presenting with haemoperitoneum (HP). Controlled abdominal drainage was initially attempted in Case 1 but was not successful. A ventral midline exploratory laparotomy allowed removal of a haemorrhaging 13 kg GCT. The mare made a full recovery and returned to normal work as a driving pony 11 months post-operatively. In Case 2 controlled abdominal drainage was followed by standing left flank laparoscopic visualisation of the bleeding ovary and transection of the ovarian pedicle by electrocautery. The GCT was then removed via a ventral midline incision due to its large size. Haemoperitoneum can be associated with GCTs and in some cases is severe enough to prompt emergency treatment. Stabilisation of the patient and removal of the haemorrhaging GCT can lead to a successful outcome.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary artery thrombosis (PAT) is involved in lung vascular dysfunction during acute chest syndrome (ACS) complicating sickle cell disease (SCD). No clinical score is available to identify patients eligible for multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography during ACS. This retrospective study aimed to develop a risk score for PAT during ACS (PAT-ACS risk score). Patients with SCD were investigated by MDCT during ACS. A logistic regression was performed to determine independent risks factors for PAT and to build the PAT-ACS risk score. A total of 43 episodes (11·9%) of PAT were diagnosed in 361 episodes of ACS. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors, which were included in the PAT-ACS risk score: a baseline haemoglobin >82 g/l, the lack of a triggering factor for ACS, a platelet count >440 ? 109/l and a PaCO2 <38 mmHg at ACS diagnosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the PAT-ACS risk score was 0·74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0·69?0·79) and differed from that of the revised Geneva score (0·63 (95% CI 0·58?0·69); P = 0·04). The negative predictive value of a PAT-ACS risk score ≥2 was 94%. In conclusion, we propose a simple clinical risk score to identify SCD patients at high risk of PAT during ACS.

AB  - Abstract Background Recent studies provide evidence for significant and previously underestimated barrier damaging effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy skin in vivo. Objectives To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96?hours. Results n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of propofol required to prevent purposeful movement in response to a standardized stimulus in goats. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Animals Eight healthy goats (four does, four wethers). Methods Anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg kg?1 propofol intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of propofol at 0.6 mg kg?1 minute?1 was initiated immediately to maintain anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing system delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial propofol infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before responses to noxious stimulation provided by clamping the proximal part of the claw with a Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds were tested. In the presence or absence of purposeful movements of the extremities, the infusion rate was increased or reduced by 0.1 mg kg?1 minute?1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw clamping was repeated. The propofol MIR for each goat was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Basic cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored, recorded and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. The quality of recovery from anaesthesia was assessed and scored. Results The median MIR of propofol was 0.45 mg kg?1 minute?1 (range: 0.45?0.55 mg kg?1 minute?1). Induction and recovery were free of adverse behaviour. No statistically significant cardiopulmonary changes in comparison with baseline were observed, but clinically relevant hypoxaemia at 2 minutes after induction of anaesthesia was consistently observed. Chewing during anaesthesia was observed in three goats. Median times to extubation and standing were 3 minutes (range: 2?6 minutes) and 10 minutes (range: 7?21 minutes), respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance Propofol induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia minimally compromise cardiopulmonary function when oxygen is supplemented in goats.
