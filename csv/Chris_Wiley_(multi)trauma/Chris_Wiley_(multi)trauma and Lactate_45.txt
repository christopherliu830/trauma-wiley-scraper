AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The wild progenitors of the domestic horse were subject to natural selection for speed and stamina for millennia. Uniquely, this process has been augmented in Thoroughbreds, which have undergone at least 3 centuries of intense artificial selection for athletic phenotypes. While the phenotypic adaptations to exercise are well described, only a small number of the underlying genetic variants contributing to these phenotypes have been reported. Objectives: A panel of candidate performance-related genes was examined for DNA sequence variation in Thoroughbreds and the association with racecourse performance investigated. Materials and methods: Eighteen candidate genes were chosen for their putative roles in exercise. Re-sequencing in Thoroughbred samples was successful for primer sets in 13 of these genes. SNPs identified in this study and from the EquCab2.0 SNP database were genotyped in 2 sets of Thoroughbred samples (n = 150 and 148) and a series of population-based case-control investigations were performed by separating the samples into discrete cohorts on the basis of retrospective racecourse performance. Results: Twenty novel SNPs were detected in 3 genes: ACTN3, CKM and COX4I2. Genotype frequency distributions for 3 SNPs in CKM and COX4I2 were significantly (P<0.05) different between elite Thoroughbreds and racehorses that had never won a race. These associations were not validated when an additional (n = 130) independent set of samples was genotyped, but when analyses included all samples (n = 278) the significance of association at COX4I2 g.22684390C>T was confirmed (P<0.02). Conclusions: While molecular genetic information has the potential to become a powerful tool to make improved decisions in horse industries, it is vital that rigour is applied to studies generating these data and that adequate and appropriate sample sets, particularly for independent replication, are used.

AB  - Summary An investigation of 78 cases of typical Australian Stringhalt from 52 properties in Victoria was carried out from 1985 to 1987. Horses were either examined in the field (n = 52), referred to the Veterinary Clinical Centre (n = 13) or clinical details were obtained verbally (n = 13). In addition 10 cases of false or atypical stringhalt were examined. Detailed soil and pasture analysis was carried out on 14 properties where Australian Stringhalt had occurred. Information was also obtained on epidemiology of the condition from a survey of practitioners. Fifty of the 52 cases examined in the field occurred in horses that were dependent upon poor quality unimproved dry pasture. In all but a few cases, there was no pasture improvement or fertiliser application, leading to the development of weed-dominated pastures, particularly by flatweed, Hypochaeris radicata. The range of clinical signs exhibited by horses with Australian Stringhalt was described and a grading system proposed to classify horses according to severity of signs. Laryngeal abnormalities were present in 10 of 11 cases examined endoscopically and these horses exhibited increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in the long digital extensor muscle at rest and during hindlimb flexion. To a large extent, the EMG changes disappeared and digital extensor muscle atrophy improved in two horses that were monitored to recovery. Deep peroneal nerve conduction studies in four horses with Australian Stringhalt showed a substantial reduction in nerve conduction velocity and when stimulated at 50 Hz were unable to sustain activation of the long digital extensor muscle. EMG and evoked responses appeared to be sensitive indicators of the state of the disease. Spontaneous recovery over a period ranging from a few days to over 18 months occurred in 78 per cent (45 out of 58) of field cases available for follow up, although eight horses were destroyed on humane grounds or for pathological investigation.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Neonatal encephalopathy is the most common neurological abnormality identified in neonatal foals, but its clinical course has been rarely characterised. Objectives To describe factors associated with nonsurvival in a population of foals diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional clinical study. Methods Cases were selected from equine neonatal (≤14 days of age) admissions between 1996 and 2007. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical parameters, laboratory variables and therapeutic interventions associated with nonsurvival. Results A total of 94 foals were included in the study. Median age at admission was 12 h (range 0?96 h). The most frequently identified clinical signs included abnormal udder seeking (59%), abnormal suckle (55%), inability to stand (42%), abnormal gastrointestinal motility (37%), abnormal consciousness (34%) and seizure activity (22%). Overall, 75 (79.8%) foals survived to be discharged from the hospital and 19 foals died or were subjected to euthanasia. Variables significantly associated with nonsurvival in the multivariable model were serum total calcium concentration, serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, recumbency, number of concurrent diseases, and use of vasopressors/inotropes. The model correctly classified 92.0% of cases. Conclusions Overall survival was good and similar to previous reports. Vasopressors/inotropes were the only therapeutic intervention associated with nonsurvival, suggesting that persistent hypotension is associated with nonsurvival in the current population. Foals with concurrent disease, high total calcium and low alkaline phosphatase at admission, and that were recumbent or required treatment with vasopressors/inotropes during hospitalisation, were significantly less likely to survive.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Objective To understand challenges in care after stillbirth and provide tailored solutions. Design Multi-centre case study. Setting Three maternity hospitals. Population Parents with a stillborn baby, maternity staff. Methods Thematic analysis of parent interviews and staff focus groups and service provision investigation. Outcomes 1 Themes; 2 Triangulation matrix; 3 Recommendations. Results Twenty-one women, 14 partners, and 22 staff participated. Service Provision: Care for parents after stillbirth varies excessively; there are misconceptions; post-mortem does not delay follow-up. Presentation: Women ?do not feel right? before stillbirth; their management is haphazard and should be standardised. Diagnosis: Stillbirth is an emergency for parents but not always for staff; communication can seem cold; well-designed bereavement space is critical. Birth: Staff shift priorities to mother and future, but for parents their baby is still a baby; parents are not comfortable with staff recommending vaginal birth as the norm; there are several reasons why parents ask for a caesarean; better care involves clear communication, normal behaviour, and discussion of coping strategies. Post-mortem: Parents are influenced by discussions with staff. Staff should ?sow seeds?, clarify its respectful nature, delineate its purpose, and explain the timescale. Follow-up: It is not standardised; parents wish to see their multi-professional team. Conclusions There is unacceptable variation in care after stillbirth, and insensitive interactions between staff and bereaved parents. Understanding parents' needs, including why they ask for caesarean birth, will facilitate joint decision-making. Every bereaved parent is entitled to good, respectful care. Tweetable abstract Care too varied  national pathway & training urgently needed Plain Language Summary Why and how was the study carried out? Previous studies have shown that improving care after stillbirth is important for families. We investigated the opinions of bereaved parents and maternity staff to find ways to improve care. At three hospitals in 2013, all women who experienced a stillbirth were invited to an interview along with their partners. Thirty-five parents of 21 babies agreed to participate. Twenty-two obstetricians and midwives took part in focus group discussions. What were the main findings? Care was often not as good as it should and could be. Communication with parents was not always as sensitive as they would have liked because staff did not have appropriate training. Some women reported they did not ?feel right? before going to hospital. Once they arrived, there was no standard approach to how care was given. Sometimes there were long delays before the death of the baby was confirmed and action was taken. After it had been confirmed that the baby had died, staff focussed on the mothers? needs, but the parents? priorities were still with their baby. There were several reasons why parents asked for a caesarean birth that staff had not considered. Staff influenced parents? decisions about post-mortem examinations. Parents found it helpful when staff explained the respectful nature and purpose of the examination. After discharge from hospital, there was no consistent plan for how follow-up care would be given. Parents would have liked more information about their next hospital appointment. What are the limitations of the work? The parents interviewed depended on their memories of the details of the care, which happened some time ago. In staff group discussions, junior doctors may not have spoken openly because there were senior doctors present. Further research is necessary to understand and improve care globally. What is the implication for parents? Every bereaved parent is entitled to the best possible care after stillbirth, but some do not get good care. Parents and staff made suggestions that can help to develop processes for how care is given after stillbirth. These suggestions can also inform staff training, so that every single parent is treated respectfully and participates in decision making.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

Examination revealed poor muscle mass, elevated plasma levels of muscle-associated enzymes and electromyographic abnormalities. The dog was euthanased at 15 months old because of severe exercise intolerance. Tissue obtained by biopsy and at post mortem examination revealed prominent well defined central core structures within most muscle fibres, but no other abnormalities. The condition was diagnosed as a central core myopathy.

On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.

Following a presumptive diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis aggressive surgical debridement of the affected soft tissues of the antebrachium and negative pressure wound treatment of the open defect were performed. Surgical findings supported the tentative diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis and Streptococcus canis was isolated from the wound. A free skin graft was performed 29 days after admission, and augmented by 3 days of negative pressure wound therapy to facilitate graft incorporation. Healing was achieved without complications and no functional or aesthetic abnormalities remained.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Recognising and managing wounds at risk of infection is vital in wound management. ALLEVYN Ag dressings have been designed to manage exudate in chronic wounds that are at risk of infection; are displaying signs of local infection; or where a suspected increase in bacterial colonisation is delaying healing. They combine an absorbent silver sulfadiazine containing hydrocellular foam layer, with a perforated wound contact layer and highly breathable top film. The results presented are from a multi-centre clinical evaluation of 126 patients conducted to assess the performance of ALLEVYN Ag (Adhesive, Non Adhesive and Sacrum dressings) in a range of indications. Clinicians rated the dressings as acceptable for use in various wound types in 88% of patients. The majority of clinical signs of infection reduced between the initial and the final assessment. The condition of wound tissue and surrounding skin was observed to improve, and there was significant evidence of a reduction in the level of exudate from initial to final assessment (p < 0.001). Clinicians rated ALLEVYN Ag as satisfying or exceeding expectations in over 90% of patients. The evaluation showed the dressings to offer real benefits to patients and clinicians across multiple indications when used in conjunction with local protocols.

AB  - Double aortic arch denotes the persistence of both fourth aortic arches and has been reported as ?very rare? in the dog. Most reported cases have been seen in German shepherd dogs. An eight-week-old, male, 1·5-kg beagle presented with a three-week history of regurgitation and dyspnoea. A barium oesophagram showed severe oesophageal constriction cranial to the base of the heart, and a provisional diagnosis of a persistent right aortic arch was made. A left-sided fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed. The ligamentum arteriosum was ligated and divided. The oesophagus was seen lying on the right-hand side of the aorta. Postoperatively, the puppy deteriorated and was euthanased. Postmortem revealed a double aortic arch entrapping both the oesophagus and trachea. The inexperienced surgeon could consider computed tomography or angiography to determine the exact vascular ring, and other possible concurrent vascular anomalies present, before surgery.

AB  - This report describes the first recognised case of Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in a native Scottish dog and its diagnostic confirmation using polymerase chain reaction. The use of this technique to definitively diagnose canine angiostrongylosis confirms the presence of this epidemiologically significant case. The implications of the changing distribution of this parasite are discussed.

AB  - Hypoglycaemia is a common, life-threatening complication that occurs as a component of a wide variety of disease processes. Despite its frequent occurrence, information concerning the aetiology, characteristics and outcomes of hypoglycaemic crises in veterinary medicine is limited. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia, the body's counter-regulatory response, underlying aetiologies, diagnosis and treatment. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence in veterinary literature regarding prognostic indicators, prevalence, diagnosis and treatment is examined for hypoglycaemia-related disease processes including insulinoma, glucose-lowering toxins and medications.

AB  - Summary In this article we report 3 horses that developed an extraperitoneal abscess after colic surgery at the incision site. All 3 horses presented with nonspecific clinical signs and extraperitoneal abscess was diagnosed from ultrasound evaluations and cytological examination of abscess aspirates. One horse developed dehiscence of the incision after drainage of the abscess through the incision. In 2 cases a small standing paramedian incision was performed through which the abscess was drained and lavaged; complete resolution of the abscess and healing of the incision was achieved in both cases. Extraperitoneal abscess is a previously unreported incisional complication after colic surgery in horses. Early and careful ultrasonographic examination of the abdominal incision is required for diagnosis in cases with nonspecific clinical signs. A paramedian incision through the rectus abdominis muscle into the abscess cavity permitted adequate drainage and debridement of the abscess in 2 cases.
