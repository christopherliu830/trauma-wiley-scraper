AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on intrapulmonary shunt, cardiac output and oxygen delivery in horses subjected to a 6 hour period of general anaesthesia. Study design Randomized, experimental, crossover study. Animals Ten healthy adult horses. Methods Following medetomidine, diazepam and ketamine administration, orotracheal intubation was performed and horses positioned in dorsal recumbency. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane carried in an oxygen and air mix (FiO2 0.5) combined with a medetomidine infusion. Horses were anaesthetized twice and either CPAP (8 cmH2O) or physiologic airway pressure (NO CPAP) was applied to the lungs for 6 hours; the order of treatments was randomly assigned. Following induction of anaesthesia, cardiovascular and respiratory variables (including arterial blood gas analysis) were recorded every 30 minutes, cardiac output was measured every 60 minutes using the lithium dilution technique and oxygen delivery calculated. If PaCO2 exceeded 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), controlled ventilation was initiated and horses excluded from further data collection. Groups were compared using a general linear model. Results Data from eight horses were analysed. PaO2 was 15?56 mmHg (2.00?7.45 kPa) higher (p < 0.001) and shunt fraction 6?14% lower (p < 0.001) in the CPAP group. No differences were seen for cardiac output and oxygen delivery. The lack of difference in oxygen delivery was attributed to lower haemoglobin levels in the CPAP group than in the NO CPAP group. Conclusions and clinical relevance CPAP of 8 cmH2O can be used in dorsally recumbent horses to decrease pulmonary shunt fraction without causing a decrease in cardiac output during longterm anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract The advent of antibiotics revolutionized the medical care resulting in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. However, excessive use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance and indeed, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is considered as a major disadvantage in the medication strategy, which led the scholar?s attention toward innovative antibiotic sources in recent years. Medicinal plants contained a variety of secondary metabolites with a wide range of therapeutic potential against the resistant microbes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the antibacterial potential of traditional herbal medicine against bacterial infections. About more than 200 Published research articles reporting the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against drug resistant microbial infections were searched using different databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) etc. with various keywords like Medicinal plants having antibacterial activities, antimicrobial potentials, phytotherapy of bacterial infection etc., and articles were selected related to the efficacious herbs easily available to local population addressing common pathogens. Various plants such as Artocarpus communis, Rheum emodi, Gentiana lutea L., Cassia fistula L., Rosemarinus officinalis, Argemone maxicana L, Hydrastis canadensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Cymbopogon citrates, Carica papaya, Euphorbia hirta etc. were found to have significant antibacterial activities. Although, herbal preparations have promising potential in the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infection, but still, more research is required to isolate phytoconstituents, their mechanism of action as well as to find their impacts on human body.

AB  - Abstract Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for phosphorus. The Panel considered data from balance studies, losses of phosphorus from the body and intestinal absorption for possible use in a factorial approach, and studies on phosphorus intake and long-term health outcomes. The Panel concluded that these data were insufficient for setting DRVs for phosphorus. Data on the calcium to phosphorus ratio in bones of healthy adults, adjusted for the proportion of phosphorus found outside bone, and data on whole-body calcium and phosphorus contents in Caucasian adults indicate that the calcium to phosphorus molar ratio in the body ranges from 1.4:1 to 1.9:1. Although the fractional absorption of phosphorus is higher than that of calcium, the Panel considered that the actual amounts of calcium and phosphorus that are available for absorption from the diet cannot be determined; therefore, the whole-body calcium to phosphorus ratio was used to set DRVs. The data were considered insufficient to derive Average Requirements and Population Reference Intakes. Based on the DRVs for calcium and considering a molar calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.4:1 to 1.9:1, amounts of phosphorus were calculated. The Panel chose the lower bound of this range (a ratio of 1.4:1, which results in a higher phosphorus intake value) for setting an Adequate Intake (AI), taking into account estimated phosphorus intakes in Western countries, which are considerably higher than the values calculated. The AI is 160 mg/day for infants (7?11 months) and between 250 and 640 mg/day for children. For adults, the AI is 550 mg/day. Taking into consideration adaptive changes in phosphorus metabolism that occur during pregnancy and lactation, it was considered that the AI for adults also applies to pregnant and lactating women.

AB  - Anticipated shortages in donated blood supply have prompted investigation of alternative approaches for in vitro production of red blood cells (RBCs), such as expansion of conditional immortalization erythroid progenitors. However, there is a bioprocessing challenge wherein factors promoting maximal cell expansion and growth-limiting inhibitory factors are yet to be investigated. The authors use an erythroblast cell line (ImEry) derived from immortalizing CD71+CD235a+ erythroblast from adult peripheral blood for optimization of expansion culture conditions. Design of experiments (DOE) is used in media formulation to explore relationships and interactive effects between factors which affect cell expansion. Our in-house optimized medium formulation produced significantly higher cell densities (3.62?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3) compared to commercial formulations (2.07?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3; at 209?h culture). Culture media costs per unit of blood is shown to have a 2.96?3.09 times cost reduction. As a proof of principle for scale up, ImEry are expanded in a half-liter stirred-bioreactor under controlled settings. Growth characteristics, metabolic, and molecular profile of the cells are evaluated. ImEry has identical O2 binding capacity to adult erythroblasts. Amino acid supplementation results in further yield improvements. The study serves as a first step for scaling up erythroblast expansion in controlled bioreactors.

AB  - Abstract Case 1 A two-year old, 462?kg Standard bred horse was anesthetized for arthroscopy and castration. During anesthesia, hyperemia of the mucosal membranes and urticaria were noticed. During 5?hours of anesthesia subcutaneous edema of the eyelids and neck region developed. In the recovery box, the orotracheal (OT) tube was left in situ and secured in place with tape. Following initial attempts to stand, the horse became highly agitated and signs consistent with pulmonary edema developed subsequently. Arterial hypoxemia (PaO2: 3.7?kPa [28?mmHg]) and hypocapnia (PaCO2: 3.1?kPa [23?mmHg]) were confirmed. Oxygen and furosemide were administered. The horse was assisted to standing with a sling. Therapy continued with bilateral intra-nasal oxygen insufflation. Ancillary medical therapy included flunixin meglumine, penicillin, gentamycin and dimethylsulfoxide. Following 7?hours of treatment the arterial oxygen tensions began to increase towards normal values. Case 2 An 11-year old, 528?kg Paint horse was anesthetized for surgery of a submandibular mass. The 4-hour anesthetic period was unremarkable. The OT tube was left in situ for the recovery. During recovery, the horse was slightly agitated and stood after three attempts. Clinical signs consistent with pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia (PaO2: 5?kPa [37.5?mmHg]) subsequently developed following extubation. Respiratory signs resolved with medical therapy, including unilateral nasal oxygen insufflation, furosemide, flunixin meglumine and dimethylsulfoxide. The diagnosis of pulmonary edema in these horses was made by clinical signs and arterial blood-gas analysis. While pulmonary radiographs were not taken to confirm the diagnosis, the clinical signs following anesthesia support the diagnosis in both cases. The etiology of pulmonary edema was most likely multifactorial.

AB  - Left displaced abomasum (LDA) and abomasal volvulus (AV) occur most commonly in postparturient dairy cows. Our main hypothesis was that endotoxemia occurred more frequently in the peripheral blood of cows with LDA or AV than in healthy cows because increased luminal pressure in AV or LDA, or the presence of a hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction in AV, may have injured the abomasal mucosa, thereby facilitating translocation of luminal endotoxin into the circulation. Therefore, our main objective was to compare the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in healthy postparturient cows with the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in cows with AV and LDA. We examined 60 adult dairy cows in early lactation that were diagnosed with AV (n = 15) or LDA (n = 15) or were healthy on physical examination (control group, n = 30). Jugular venous blood was obtained from cows in all 3 groups, and right gastroepiploic venous blood was obtained during surgical correction of AV and LDA immediately after repositioning of the abomasum. Platelet-rich plasma endotoxin concentrations were measured with a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Endotoxin was detected in jugular vein plasma in 50% (15/30) of control cows; however, the prevalence of endotoxemia was significantly lower (P < .05) in cows with AV (7%, 1/15) or LDA (20%, 3/15). Endotoxin was detected simultaneously in right gastroepiploic and jugular vein plasma in only 1 cow with LDA and 0 cows with AV. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that endotoxemia is infrequently present in postparturient dairy cows with AV or LDA.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4 h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - Summary It has become increasingly obvious that factors such as communication, teamwork, and leadership have significant roles in patient safety. In healthcare, when communication breaks down patient safety is jeopardized, a reality that has been documented in a number of clinical settings, including general medicine, emergency departments, and surgery. Teamwork is the array of interconnected behaviors, cognitive processes, and attitudes that make coordinated and adaptive performance possible in complex environments such as clinical settings. This chapter provides some examples of breakdowns in communication within the context of veterinary anesthesia. Every method of communication is prone to error. Oral communications are often only partially recalled by the receiver. Written communications are time consuming so are often only partially completed. Electronic communications are often too brief. Forms should be backed up with verbal communications and vice versa. Standardizing communication and communication training should be encouraged.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare, ventilation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (RM) to classical IPPV without PEEP on gas exchange during anaesthesia and early recovery. Study design? Prospective randomized study. Animals? Twenty-four warm-blood horses, weight mean 548?±?SD 49?kg undergoing surgery for colic. Methods? Premedication, induction and maintenance (isoflurane in oxygen) were identical in all horses. Group C (n?=?12) was ventilated using conventional IPPV, inspiratory pressure (PIP) 35?45?cmH2O; group RM (n?=?12) using similar IPPV with constant PEEP (10?cmH2O) and intermittent RMs (three consecutive breaths PIP 60, 80 then 60?cmH2O, held for 10?12?seconds). RMs were applied as required to maintain arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) at >400?mmHg (53.3?kPa). Physiological parameters were recorded intraoperatively. Arterial blood gases were measured intra- and postoperatively. Recovery times and quality of recovery were measured or scored. Results? Statistically significant findings were that horses in group RM had an overall higher PaO2 (432?±?101?mmHg) than those in group C (187?±?112?mmHg) at all time points including during the early recovery period. Recovery time to standing position was significantly shorter in group RM (49.6?±?20.7?minutes) than group C (70.7?±?24.9). Other measured parameters did not differ significantly. The median (range) of number of RMs required to maintain PaO2 above 400?mmHg per anaesthetic was 3 (1?8). Conclusion? Ventilation using IPPV with constant PEEP and RM improved arterial oxygenation lasting into the early recovery period in conjunction with faster recovery of similar quality. However this ventilation mode was not able to open up the lung completely and to keep it open without repeated recruitment. Clinical relevance? This mode of ventilation may provide a clinically practicable method of improving oxygenation in anaesthetized horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Evaluation of five pulse oximeters in dogs, cats and horses with sensors placed at five sites and hemoglobin saturation at three plateaus. Study design? Prospective randomized multispecies experimental trial. Animals? Five healthy dogs, cats and horses. Methods? Animals were anesthetized and instrumented with ECG leads and arterial catheters. Five pulse oximeters (Nellcor Puritan Bennett-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and Surgi-Vet V3304) with sensors at five sites were studied in a 5???5 Latin square design. Ten readings (SpO2) were taken at each of three hemoglobin saturation plateaus (98, 85 and 72%) in each animal. Arterial samples were drawn concurrently and hemoglobin saturation was measured with a co-oximeter. Accuracy of saturation measurements was calculated as the root mean squared difference (RMSD), a composite of bias and precision, for each model tested in each species. Results? Accuracy varied widely. In dogs, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 2.7, 2.2, 2.4, 1.7 and 2.7% respectively. Failure to produce readings for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 0, 0, 0.7, 0, and 20%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the tongue, toe, ear, lip and prepuce or vulva were 0.95, 0.97, 0.69, 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. In horses, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 3.1, 3.0, 4.7, 3.3 and 2.1%, respectively while rates of failure to produce readings were 10, 21, 0, 17 and 60%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the tongue, nostril, ear, lip and prepuce or vulva were 0.98, 0.94, 0.88, 0.93 and 0.94, respectively. In cats, the RMSD for all data for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 5.9, 5.6, 7.9, 7.9 and 10.7%, respectively while failure rates were 0, 0.7, 0, 20 and 32%, respectively. The correlation coefficients for the tongue, rear paw, ear, lip and front paw were 0.54, 0.79,.0.64, 0.49 and 0.57, respectively. For saturations above 90% in cats, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 2.6, 4.4, 4.0, 3.5 and 4.8%, respectively, while failure rates were 0, 1.7, 0, 25 and 43%, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Accuracy and failure rates (failure to produce a reading) varied widely from model to model and from species to species. Generally, among the models tested in the clinically relevant range (90?100%) RMSD ranged from 2?5% while failure rates were highest in the V3304.

AB  - Summary Carbohydrate (CHO) stored in the form of skeletal muscle glycogen is the main energy source for glycolytic and oxidative ATP production during vigorous exercise in mammals. In man, horse and dog both short-term high intensity and prolonged submaximal exercise deplete muscle glycogen. In horses, however, muscle glycogen synthesis is 2?3-fold slower than in man and rat, even when a diet high in soluble CHO is fed. There appear to be significant differences in CHO and glycogen metabolism between horses and other mammals, and it is becoming increasingly clear that many conclusions drawn from human exercise physiology do not apply to horses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive, comparative summary of the research on muscle glycogen synthesis in horse, man and rodent. Species differences in CHO uptake and utilisation are examined and the issues with feeding high soluble CHO diets to horses are discussed. Alternative feeding strategies, including protein and long and short chain fatty acid supplementation and the importance of rehydration, are explored.

AB  - Trace elements are essential for many physiologic processes. In recent years, supplementation has been studied for a variety of indications, including glycemic control, wound healing, antioxidant effect, and anemia. Critical illness, especially states such as burns, traumas, and septic shock, is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition. In these patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition or pharmaceutical supplementation is used to provide essential macronutrients, including trace elements. The purpose of this review is to describe trace element supplementation, including iron, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium, and zinc, and highlight their mechanism, pharmacology, outcome data, and adverse effects.

AB  - Abstract Childhood and adolescent rates of obesity and overweight are continuing to increase in much of the world. Risk factors such as diet composition, excess caloric intake, decreased exercise, genetics, and the built environment are active areas of etiologic research. The obesogen hypothesis, which postulates that prenatal and perinatal chemical exposure can contribute to risk of childhood and adolescent obesity, remains relatively underexamined. This review surveys numerous classes of chemicals for which this hypothesis has been explored. We focus on human data where they exist and also discuss the findings of rodent and cell culture studies. Organochlorine chemicals as well as several classes of chemicals that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are identified as possible risk factors for obesity. Recommendations for future epidemiologic and experimental research on the chemical origins of obesity are also given. Mt Sinai J Med 78:22?48, 2011. ? 2011 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the accuracy of an oscillometric blood pressure monitor in anesthetized sheep. Study design Prospective study. Animals Twenty healthy adult sheep, 11 males and nine females, weighing 63.6 ± 8.6 kg. Methods After premedication with buprenorphine or transdermal fentanyl, anesthesia was induced with ketamine-midazolam and maintained with isoflurane and ketamine, 1.2 mg kg?1 hour?1, ± lidocaine, 3 mg kg?1 hour?1. Invasive blood pressure measurements were obtained from an auricular arterial catheter and noninvasive measurements were from a cuff on the metatarsus or antebrachium. Simultaneous invasive and noninvasive measurements were recorded over a range (55?111 mmHg) of mean arterial pressures (MAP). Isoflurane concentration was increased to decrease MAP and decreasing the isoflurane concentration and infusing dobutamine achieved higher pressures. Invasive and noninvasive measurements were compared. Results Correlation (R2) was good between the two methods of measurement (average of three consecutive readings) for systolic (SAP) (0.87), diastolic (DAP) (0.86), and mean (0.90) arterial pressures (p < 0.001). Bias ± SD between noninvasive and invasive measurements for SAP was 3 ± 8 mmHg, for DAP was ?10 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. There was no significant difference between the average of three measurements and use of the first measurement. Correlations using the first measurement were SAP (0.82), DAP (0.84), and MAP (0.89). Bias ± SD for SAP was 3 ±10 mmHg, for DAP was ?11 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. The oscillometric monitor slightly overestimated SAP and underestimated DAP and MAP for both average values and the first reading. Conclusions and clinical relevance This oscillometric model provided MAP measurements that were acceptable by ACVIM standards. MAP measurements with this monitor were lower than those found with the invasive technique so a clinical diagnosis of hypotension may be made in sheep that are not hypotensive.

AB  - Summary The normal control of water and electrolyte balance is discussed and an attempt is made to relate the volumes of water and electrolyte involved to an animal as large as a 500Kg horse. The imbalance that may be expected in a case of bowel obstruction is assessed related to the pathological processes involved. Diagnosis of the imbalance present and the clinical and laboratory investigations that may be carried out are described and some guidance on the management of a clinical case referred for surgery is given. Résumé Le controle normal de l'équilibre hydrique et des électrolytes est exposé et l'on tente d'estimer les quantités d'eau et d'électrolytes nécessaires pour un animal de 500 kilos. Le déséquilibre qu'on peut attendre lors d'obstruction intestinale dépend a priori des processus pathologiques en cours. Le diagnostic du déséquilibre et les éléments du diagnostic clinique et de laboratoire sont décrits. Quelques indications sur la manière de procéder lors d'intervention sont données. Zusammenfassung Eine Besprechung der normalen Kontrolle des Wasser-und Elektrolytgleichgewichts wird gefolgt vom Versuch, die Volumina von Wasser und Elektrolyten bei einem 500 kg wiegenden Pferd zu bestimmen. Die Gleichgewichtsstörungen, die bei einem Fall von Darmverschluss zu erwarten sind, werden in Abhängigkeit von den pathologischen Veränderungen abgeschätzt. Die Diagnose einer Störung durch klinische Untersuchungen und Laborbefunde wird besprochen und Richtlinien für die Pflege entsprechender Fälle werden angegeben. Sumario Sev trata el control normal del balance hídrico y electrólitico como intento de relacionar el volumen de agua y electrolitos comptendidos en grandes animales como un caballo de 500 kilos. La falta de equilibrio puede sospecharse en casos de obstrucciones intestinales o cambios patológicos. Se da el diagnóstico en los casos de falta de equilibrio presentados en casos clínicos e investigaciones de laboratorio que pueden llevar a guiar l manejo de ciertos casos clínicos referidos para cirugía.
