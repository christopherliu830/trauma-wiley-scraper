AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Accumulations of mucus within the trachea are often found during endoscopic examinations of the airways of poorly performing racehorses, but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of tracheal mucus, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) and cytological indices of tracheal aspirate on racing performance in Thoroughbred horses assessed by race place and whether the horse was raced. Methods: Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea was performed, and a tracheal aspirate obtained monthly at Thistledown racetrack from April to December, 2002 and 2003. Horses received a score of 0?4 for the degree of PLH and 0?4 for the amount of mucus visible in the trachea. The tracheal aspirate was assessed for turbidity, and total and differential cell counts. Generalised estimating equations models were used as repeated measures models for each risk factor and the level of association assessed through the risk factor's P value in the model. Results: Moderate to severe tracheal mucus (2?4) was a risk factor for poor racing performance. There was no association between degree of PLH, cell counts or turbidity of tracheal wash fluid and racing performance. However, horses that raced had higher total neutrophil counts in tracheal wash aspirates than horses that did not race. Conclusions: Grades 2?4 tracheal mucus should be considered a potential cause of poor racing performance in Thoroughbred horses. Clinical relevance: Because moderate to severe tracheal mucus accumulation, and not increased tracheal neutrophils, was a risk factor for poor racing performance, functionally significant airway inflammation may best be confirmed by the presence of mucus rather than increased number of neutrophils in the trachea.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To examine the effect of including buprenorphine with detomidine for sedation of horses undergoing clinical procedures. Study design Partially blinded, randomised, prospective clinical field trial. Animals Eighty four client-owned horses scheduled for minor surgery or diagnostic investigation under standing sedation. Methods The effects of buprenorphine (5 ?g kg?1) (Group B, n = 46) or placebo (5% glucose solution) (Group C, n = 38) in combination with detomidine (10 ?g kg?1) were compared in standing horses undergoing minor clinical procedures. The primary outcome measure was successful completion of the procedure. The degree of sedation and ataxia were scored using simple descriptive scales. Heart and respiratory rates were recorded at 15?30 minute intervals. Parametric data from each group were compared using anova or t-test and non parametric data using the Mann?Whitney U test. Results The procedure was carried out successfully in 91% of Group B and 63% of Group C (p < 0.01). Repeat dosing was required in 24% of Group B and 32% of Group C (p < 0.05). Sedation was more profound and lasted longer (60 versus 45 minutes) in Group B (p < 0.01). Ataxia occurred after detomidine, increased after buprenorphine but not glucose administration, was more profound in group B and lasted longer (60 versus 30 minutes) p < 0.001). Heart and respiratory rates remained within normal limits in both groups and there were no serious adverse events. Conclusions and clinical relevance Buprenorphine 5 and 10 ?g kg?1 enhanced the sedation produced by detomidine 10 and 20 ?g kg?1 with minor side effects similar to other alpha2 agonist/opioid combinations. Detomidine?buprenorphine sedation is suitable for standing procedures in horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess if positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, without hemodynamic impairment in horses during anesthesia. Design Prospective, randomized study. Animals Thirteen isoflurane-anesthetized healthy horses. Methods After 60 minutes of anesthesia with spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation was initiated with an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 10?20 mL kg?1 and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Constant PEEP of 5 cmH2O was continued (control group; n = 6) or titrated (PEEP group; n = 7) by increasing and decreasing PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH2O at 15-minute intervals. The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow collection of blood for pH and blood gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary assessment was recorded before PEEP titration and after 15 minutes at each PEEP value. Results In the PEEP group, static compliance (range) (Cst 278?463 mL cmH2O?1) was significantly higher and the shunt fraction ( 7?20%) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [P(A-a)O2 95?325 mmHg] were significantly lower than in the control group [Cst of 246?290 mL cmH2O?1, of 16?19%, P(A-a)O2 of 253?310 mmHg; p < 0.05]. CO (mean ± SEM) was lower in the PEEP group (23 ± 2 L minute?1) at 20 cmH2O PEEP than in the control group (26 ± 4 L minute?1, p < 0.05), with no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or central venous pressure. Conclusions PEEP titration significantly improved gas exchange and lung compliance, with a small decrease in CO at the highest PEEP level. Clinical relevance Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during inhalation anesthesia can be treated using PEEP titration from 5 to 20 cmH2O, without clinically important hemodynamic effects in healthy horses.

AB  - Abstract Endothelial metabolism is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Glutamine metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs) has been poorly studied. We used genetic modifications and 13C tracing approaches to define glutamine metabolism in these cells. Glutamine supplies the majority of carbons in the tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle of ECs and contributes to lipid biosynthesis via reductive carboxylation. EC-specific deletion in mice of glutaminase, the initial enzyme in glutamine catabolism, markedly blunts angiogenesis. In cell culture, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of glutaminase prevents EC proliferation, but does not prevent cell migration, which relies instead on aerobic glycolysis. Without glutamine catabolism, there is near complete loss of TCA intermediates, with no compensation from glucose-derived anaplerosis. Mechanistically, addition of exogenous alpha-ketoglutarate replenishes TCA intermediates and rescues cellular growth, but simultaneously unveils a requirement for Rac1-dependent macropinocytosis to provide non-essential amino acids, including asparagine. Together, these data outline the dependence of ECs on glutamine for cataplerotic processes; the need for glutamine as a nitrogen source for generation of biomass; and the distinct roles of glucose and glutamine in EC biology.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To assess the effect of morphine on the bispectral index (BIS) in dogs during isoflurane anesthesia maintained at a constant end-tidal concentration. Study design? Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals? Eight adult Beagle dogs, weighing between 7.1 and 9.8?kg. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane via a face mask. Dog?s tracheas were intubated and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane at a constant end-tidal concentration (e?Iso) of 1.81% for a 30-minute equilibration period. Pulmonary ventilation was controlled to normocapnia. After equilibration, baseline values were recorded prior to intravenous administration of morphine sulfate (0.5?mg?kg?1) (MT) or an equal volume of saline (CT). Measurements for heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP) were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120?minutes after treatment. Bispectral index was recorded every 10?seconds for 3?minutes for each time measurement. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 120?minutes for determination of morphine serum concentrations. Anesthesia was discontinued after the last measurement and dogs were allowed to recover. Results? Baseline BIS for MT and CT at 1.81%e?Iso were 63?±?10 and 58?±?9, respectively. Bispectral index in MT was 4?8% lower at 20, 75, 90 and 105?minutes compared with CT. There were no differences in BIS between baseline and any subsequent measurement within either MT or CT. Heart rate, SAP, MAP, and DAP decreased after morphine administration. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Intravenous administration of 0.5?mg?kg?1 morphine sulfate did not cause clinically significant changes in the BIS of unstimulated dogs during isoflurane anesthesia at an e?Iso of 1.81%.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To record the bispectral index (BIS) when horses moved during either halothane or sevoflurane anaesthesia and when they made volitional movements during recovery from these anaesthetics. Study design? Randomized prospective clinical study. Animals? Twenty-five client-owned horses undergoing surgery aged 8.8 (±?5.3; 1?19) years (mean?± SD; range). Methods? Baseline BIS values were recorded before pre-anaesthetic medication (BISB) and during anaesthesia (BISA) maintained with halothane (group H; n?=?12) or sevoflurane (group S; n?=13) at approximately 0.8?0.9???minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC). Bispectral indices were recorded during the surgery when unexpected movement occurred (BISMA), during recovery when the first movement convincingly associated with consciousness was observed (BISM1) and once sternal recumbency was achieved (BISST). Results? No significant difference in BISM1 was found between halothane- (85?±?7; 75?93) and sevoflurane- (87?±?10; 70?98) anaesthetized horses although BISA was significantly (p?=?0.0002) lower in group S (62?±?7; 53?72) than group H (74?±?7; 60?84). Differences between BISM1 and BISA were significant in sevoflurane (p?=?0.00001) and halothane recipients (p?=?0.002) but were greater in group S (25?±?9; 4?38) compared with group H (12?±?10; ?9?25). In six of eight horses, BISMA values ranged between those recorded during anaesthesia and at first movement. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Bispectral indices appear to approximate levels of unconsciousness, suggesting that monitoring the BIS may assist equine anaesthesia. However, it does not predict intra-operative movement.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To study heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (BP) and autonomic nervous (AN) effects of edrophonium?atropine combinations during neuromuscular blockade (NMB) antagonism in sheep. Experimental design? Randomized, prospective and experimental study. Animals? Seventy-eight Scottish blackface ewes; mean age: 4.5?years; mean body mass: 54?kg. Methods? After induction with IV etomidate (0.5?mg?kg?1) and midazolam (0.5?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with halothane and NMB produced with atracurium or mivacurium. In the first study (n?=?53), the electrocardiographic (ECG), HR, BP and AN effects of low (40??g?kg?1) and high (80??g?kg?1) atropine doses combined with either of two edrophonium doses (0.5 or 1.0?mg?kg?1) were investigated. These variables were also measured in a second study when edrophonium (1.0?mg?kg?1) was administered 5?minutes before atropine (80??g?kg?1) and vice versa. Data were analysed using one-way within-subjects and repeated measures anova. Results? In the first study, all combinations reversed NMB but significantly (p?<?0.001) increased HR and BP within 2?minutes without arrhythmias. In the second study, edrophonium (1.0?mg?kg?1) significantly increased HR and BP, saliva flow (n?=?1) and lung sounds (n?=?3) and caused ECG changes (n?=?1). Cardiovascular changes were partially reversed by atropine (80??g?kg?1) administered 5?minutes later. Administered first, atropine (80??g?kg?1) significantly decreased HR and BP effects which were fully (HR) and partially (BP) reversed by edrophonium (1?mg?kg?1) administered 5?minutes later. Conclusion and clinical relevance? The cardiovascular effects of edrophonium and atropine were opposite to those reported in humans and dogs. Edrophonium (0.5?mg?kg?1) and atropine (80??g kg?1) caused the mildest HR changes without ECG and noncardiac AN disturbances, and is recommended for the antagonism of NMB in sheep.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the influence of direct current shock application in anaesthetized horses with atrial fibrillation (AF) and to study the effects of cardioversion to sinus rhythm (SR). Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Eight horses successfully treated for AF (transvenous electrical cardioversion after amiodarone pre-treatment). Methods? Cardioversion catheters and a pacing catheter were placed under sedation [detomidine 10??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)]. After additional sedation (5?10??g?kg?1 detomidine, 0.1?mg?kg?1 methadone IV), anaesthesia was induced with ketamine, 2.2?mg?kg?1 and midazolam, 0.06?mg?kg?1 (IV) in a sling and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Flunixin meglumine, 1.1?mg?kg?1, was administered IV. Shocks were delivered as biphasic truncated exponential waves, synchronized with the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. Monitoring included pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, capnography, inhalational anaesthetic agent concentration, arterial blood pressure, LiDCO and PulseCO cardiac index (CI) and arterial blood gases. Values before and after the first unsuccessful shock and before and after cardioversion to SR were compared. Results? Values before the first shock were comparable to reported values in healthy, isoflurane anaesthetized horses. Reliable CI measurements could not be obtained using the PulseCO technique. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was required in most horses (bradypnea and/or PaCO2 >8?kPa, 60?mmHg), while dobutamine was administered in two horses (0.3?0.5??g?kg?1?minute?1). After the 1st unsuccessful shock application, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) was decreased (p?=?0.025), other recorded values were not influenced (CI measurements not available for this analysis). SR was associated with increases in CI (p?=?0.039) and stroke index (p?=?0.002) and a decrease in SAP (p?=?0.030). Conclusions and clinical relevance? Despite the presence of AF, cardiovascular function was well maintained during anaesthesia and was not affected by shock application. Cardiac index and stroke index increased and SAP decreased after cardioversion.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the cardiovascular effects of epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs. Study design? Prospective, randomized, blinded experiment. Animals? A total of six healthy adult female Beagles aged 1.25?±?0.08?years and weighing 12.46?± 1.48 (10.25?14.50) kg. Methods? Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (6?9?mg?kg?1) and maintained with 1.8?1.9% end-tidal isoflurane in oxygen. End-tidal CO2 was kept between 35 and 45?mmHg (4.7?6.0?kPa) using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) were monitored. Cardiac output was determined using a LiDCO monitor and the derived parameters were calculated. After baseline measurements, either 10??g?kg?1 romifidine or saline (total volume 1?mL 4.5?kg?1) was injected into the lumbosacral epidural space. Data were recorded for 1?hour after epidural injection. A minimum of 1?week elapsed between treatments. Results? After epidural injection, the overall means (±?standard deviation, SD) of HR (95?±?20?bpm), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (81 ± 19?mmHg), CO (1.63?±?0.66?L?minute?1), cardiac index (CI) (2.97?±?1.1?L?minute?1?m?2) and stroke volume index (SI) (1.38?±?0.21?mL beat?1?kg?1) were significantly lower in the romifidine treatment compared with the overall means in the saline treatment [HR (129?±?24?bpm), MAP (89 ± 17?mmHg), CO (3.35?±?0.86?L?minute?1), CI (6.17 ± 1.4?L?minute?1?m?2) and SI (2.21?±?0.21?mL?beat?1?kg?1)]. The overall mean of systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (7202?± 2656 dynes seconds cm?5?m?2) after epidural romifidine injection was significantly higher than the overall mean of SVRI (3315?±?1167 dynes seconds cm?5?m?2) after epidural saline injection. Conclusion? Epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs caused significant cardiovascular effects similar to those reportedly produced by systemic romifidine administration. Clinical relevance? Similar cardiovascular monitoring is required after epidural and systemically administered romifidine. Further studies are required to evaluate the analgesic effects of epidural romifidine.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the influence of a detomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) on cardiovascular function, isoflurane requirements and recovery quality in horses undergoing elective surgery. Study design? Prospective, randomized, blinded, clinical trial. Animals? Twenty adult healthy horses. Methods? After sedation (detomidine, 10??g?kg?1 intravenously [IV]) and induction of anaesthesia (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1, ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1 IV), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air (inspiratory oxygen fraction 55%). When indicated, the lungs were mechanically ventilated. Dobutamine was administered when MAP?<?70 mmHg. The horses were randomly allocated to one of two groups and throughout anaesthesia, received either a detomidine (5??g?kg?1?hour?1) (D) or saline (S) CRI, with the anaesthetist unaware of the treatment. Monitoring included end-tidal isoflurane concentration, arterial pH, PaCO2, PaO2, dobutamine administration rate, heart rate (HR), arterial pressure, cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke index and oxygen delivery index (?O2I). For recovery from anaesthesia, all horses received 2.5??g?kg?1 detomidine IV. Recovery quality and duration were recorded in each horse. For statistical analysis, anova, Pearson chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used as relevant. Results  Heart rate (p?=?0.0176) and ?O2I (p?= 0.0084) were lower and SVR higher (p?=?0.0126) in group D, compared to group S. Heart rate (p?=?0.0011) and pH (p?=?0.0187) increased over time. Significant differences in isoflurane requirements were not detected. Recovery quality and duration were comparable between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance? A detomidine CRI produced cardiovascular effects typical for α2-agonists, without affecting isoflurane requirements, recovery duration or recovery quality.

AB  - Oestrus detection in Holstein cows is difficult. Hormones to induce oestrus or for fixed-time artificial insemination are now commonly prescribed to facilitate, or remove the need for, detection of oestrus. The acceptability of pharmaceutical intervention to overcome short fallings in management is discussed, including from the wider perspective of global food security. Public perception and the veterinary profession's engagement with the public over potentially controversial issues are raised.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare cardiac output () measurements using lithium dilution (LiDCO) and pulse contour analysis (PulseCO) techniques in isoflurane-anaesthetized ponies before and during the administration of different inotropic/vasoactive drugs. Study design? Prospective randomized experimental cross-over trial. Animals? Six ponies aged 5.0?±?1.6 (4?6.5) years and weighing 286?±?53 (212?368)?kg. Methods? After sedation (romifidine) and induction (midazolam?+?ketamine), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. After 90?minutes (=?T0), one of four treatments was administered: saline 0.1?mL?kg?1 (S), enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E), enoximone followed by dobutamine (0.5 ?g kg?1?minute?1 for 120?minutes) (ED) or enoximone followed by a calcium chloride infusion (0.5 mg kg?1?minute?1 for 10?minutes) (EC). Data were recorded for 120?minutes after T0. The PulseCO (recorded from carotid artery) was calibrated before T0, no further recalibrations were performed. was determined with LiDCO (LiDCO) and PulseCO (PulseCO) simultaneously at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Systemic vascular resistances (SVRLiDCO and SVRPulseCO) were calculated. Results  In the saline group, PulseCO was 4.9?± 12.3% lower than LiDCO (p?<?0.01), whereas SVRPulseCO was 6.9?±?14.4% higher than SVRLiDCO (p?<?0.01). These differences increased over time (mean?±?SEM), by 0.06?±?0.03% minute?1 (p?=?0.042) and SVR by 0.08?±?0.03% minute?1 (p?=?0.018). PulseCO was higher than LiDCO in the EC group (1.8?±?23.3%), but lower than LiDCO in groups E (?11.7?±?20.4%) and ED (?10.0?± 25.9%) (significant difference between treatments, p?<?0.01). The differences in SVR in groups E (20.4?±?32.0%) and ED (20.7?± 35.3%) were significantly higher than in groups S (6.9?±?14.4%) and EC (3.1?±?22.2%) (p?< 0.01). Conclusions and clinical relevance? Pulse contour analysis values deviated significantly from LiDCO measurements in isoflurane-anaesthetized ponies. This difference was influenced by inotropic/vasoactive drugs.

AB  - Abstract Life-history theory concerns the trade-offs that mold the patterns of investment by animals between reproduction, growth, and survival. It is widely recognized that physiology plays a role in the mediation of life-history trade-offs, but the details remain obscure. As life-history theory concerns aspects of investment in the soma that influence survival, understanding the physiological basis of life histories is related, but not identical, to understanding the process of aging. One idea from the field of aging that has gained considerable traction in the area of life histories is that life-history trade-offs may be mediated by free radical production and oxidative stress. We outline here developments in this field and summarize a number of important unresolved issues that may guide future research efforts. The issues are as follows. First, different tissues and macromolecular targets of oxidative stress respond differently during reproduction. The functional significance of these changes, however, remains uncertain. Consequently there is a need for studies that link oxidative stress measurements to functional outcomes, such as survival. Second, measurements of oxidative stress are often highly invasive or terminal. Terminal studies of oxidative stress in wild animals, where detailed life-history information is available, cannot generally be performed without compromising the aims of the studies that generated the life-history data. There is a need therefore for novel non-invasive measurements of multi-tissue oxidative stress. Third, laboratory studies provide unrivaled opportunities for experimental manipulation but may fail to expose the physiology underpinning life-history effects, because of the benign laboratory environment. Fourth, the idea that oxidative stress might underlie life-history trade-offs does not make specific enough predictions that are amenable to testing. Moreover, there is a paucity of good alternative theoretical models on which contrasting predictions might be based. Fifth, there is an enormous diversity of life-history variation to test the idea that oxidative stress may be a key mediator. So far we have only scratched the surface. Broadening the scope may reveal new strategies linked to the processes of oxidative damage and repair. Finally, understanding the trade-offs in life histories and understanding the process of aging are related but not identical questions. Scientists inhabiting these two spheres of activity seldom collide, yet they have much to learn from each other.

AB  - The authors have developed a CDS by culturing fibroblasts on the two-layered spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid (HA) and atelo-collagen (Col). This CDS is designed to promote wound healing by synergistic effect of fibroblasts and matrix. Both HA and Col molecules seem to function biologically in the process of wound healing. HA molecules play a critical role in several cellular functions such as migration and proliferation by promoting adhesion and disadhesion between the cell and the tissue substrate. Besides providing structural support and strength to the new tissue, Col molecules have a profound effect on the cells within and on its matrix. Col and Col-derived peptides act as chemoattractants for fibroblasts in vitro and may have a similar activity in vivo. Fibroblasts seeded on the Col surface of two-layered spongy matrix were found to attach, proliferate, and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as fibronectin. The cryopreserved CDS was found to keep the original potency to release VEGF after thawing followed by re-culturing. Multi-center's clinical research using allogeneic CDS has been proceeded as a national millennium project for regenerative medicine. These products are able to be stored in a freezer and transported to other hospitals in a frozen state. The clinical evaluation involving 180 cases has been already conducted using allogeneic cryopreserved CDS at 30 hospitals across Japan since April 2001. The results obtained in our clinical study suggest that this type of allogeneic CDS is able to provide an effective therapy for patients with severe full-thickness skin defects. These excellent clinical evaluations seem to be closely related to the results obtained in this fundamental study, especially related to the potency of cryopreserved allogeneic CDS to release VEGF and fibronectin.

AB  - Objectives To examine agreement in anaesthetised dogs between invasive blood pressure measurements and measurements obtained with an oscillometric blood pressure monitor. Materials and Methods Paired invasive and oscillometric measurements were taken in 24 dogs every 5 minutes during anaesthesia (9 to 37 measurements per dog). Agreement between measurement methods was explored using Bland?Altman plots. To determine the accuracy of the oscillometric measurements, the results were compared with the guidelines recommended by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Results In total, 493 paired readings were obtained: 98·6% of oscillometric readings were successful. Biases (±standard deviation) for oscillometric readings of systolic arterial blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were 2·1 (±11·5) and ?9·8 (±7·6) mm Hg, indicating slight over- and under-estimation, respectively, versus invasive measurements. More than 50% and 80% of systolic arterial and mean arterial pressure measurements were within 10 and 20 mmHg of invasively measured values, respectively. A large negative bias (?14·1 ±9·2 mmHg) against invasive measurements revealed that the oscillometric measures of diastolic arterial blood pressure measurements were under-estimated. Clinical Significance In healthy adult anaesthetised dogs, this oscillometric monitor met the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine requirements for systolic arterial and mean arterial pressure measurement but failed to meet the requirements for the measurement of diastolic arterial pressure.

AB  - Abstract Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is significant secondary damage to cerebral tissue from increased free radicals and impaired mitochondrial function. This imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the effectiveness of cellular antioxidant defenses is termed oxidative stress. Often there are insufficient antioxidants to scavenge ROS, leading to alterations in cerebral structure and function. Attenuating oxidative stress following a TBI by administering an antioxidant may decrease secondary brain injury, and currently many drugs and supplements are being investigated. We explored an over-the-counter supplement called ubiquinol (reduced form of coenzyme Q10), a potent antioxidant naturally produced in brain mitochondria. We administered intra-arterial ubiquinol to rats to determine if it would reduce mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and severity of a contusive TBI. Adult male F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Saline-TBI, (2) ubiquinol 30 minutes before TBI (UB-PreTBI), or (3) ubiquinol 30 minutes after TBI (UB-PostTBI). We found when ubiquinol was administered before or after TBI, rats had an acute reduction in brain mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and two serum biomarkers of TBI severity, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). However, in vivo neurometabolic assessment with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not show attenuated injury-induced changes. These findings are the first to show that ubiquinol preserves mitochondria and reduces cellular injury severity after TBI, and support further study of ubiquinol as a promising adjunct therapy for TBI.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the effects of a constant rate infusion (CRI) of romifidine on the requirement of isoflurane, cardiovascular performance and recovery in anaesthetized horses undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Study design? Randomized blinded prospective clinical trial. Animals? Thirty horses scheduled for routine arthroscopy. Methods? After premedication (acepromazine 0.02 mg?kg?1, romifidine 80??g?kg?1, methadone 0.1 mg?kg?1) and induction (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1 ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Horses were assigned randomly to receive a CRI of saline (group S) or 40??g?kg?1?hour?1 romifidine (group R). The influences of time and treatment on anaesthetic and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated using an analysis of variance. Body weight (t-test), duration of anaesthesia (t-test) and recovery score (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results? All but one horse were positioned in the dorsal recumbent position and ventilated from the start of anaesthesia. End tidal isoflurane concentrations were similar in both groups at similar time points and over the whole anaesthetic period. Cardiac output was significantly lower in horses of the R group, but there were no significant differences between groups in cardiac index, body weight or age. All other cardiovascular parameters were similar in both groups. Quality of recovery did not differ significantly between groups, but more horses in group R stood without ataxia at the first attempt. One horse from group S had a problematic recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance? No inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect or side effects were observed by using a 40??g?kg?1?hour?1 romifidine CRI in isoflurane anaesthetized horses under clinical conditions. Cardiovascular performance remained acceptable. Further studies are needed to identify the effective dose of romifidine that will induce an inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect in anaesthetized horses.

AB  - Please cite this paper as: The biology of burn injury. Experimental Dermatology 2010; 19: 777?783. Abstract:? Burn injury is a complex traumatic event with various local and systemic effects, affecting several organ systems beyond the skin. The pathophysiology of the burn patient shows the full spectrum of the complexity of inflammatory response reactions. In the acute phase, inflammation mechanism may have negative effects because of capillary leak, the propagation of inhalation injury and the development of multiple organ failure. Attempts to mediate these processes remain a central subject of burn care research. Conversely, inflammation is a necessary prologue and component in the later-stage processes of wound healing. In this review, we are attempting to present the current science of burn wound pathophysiology and wound healing. We also describe the evolution of innovative strategies for burn management.
