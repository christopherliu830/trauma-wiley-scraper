AB  - Abstract Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is significant secondary damage to cerebral tissue from increased free radicals and impaired mitochondrial function. This imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the effectiveness of cellular antioxidant defenses is termed oxidative stress. Often there are insufficient antioxidants to scavenge ROS, leading to alterations in cerebral structure and function. Attenuating oxidative stress following a TBI by administering an antioxidant may decrease secondary brain injury, and currently many drugs and supplements are being investigated. We explored an over-the-counter supplement called ubiquinol (reduced form of coenzyme Q10), a potent antioxidant naturally produced in brain mitochondria. We administered intra-arterial ubiquinol to rats to determine if it would reduce mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and severity of a contusive TBI. Adult male F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Saline-TBI, (2) ubiquinol 30 minutes before TBI (UB-PreTBI), or (3) ubiquinol 30 minutes after TBI (UB-PostTBI). We found when ubiquinol was administered before or after TBI, rats had an acute reduction in brain mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and two serum biomarkers of TBI severity, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). However, in vivo neurometabolic assessment with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not show attenuated injury-induced changes. These findings are the first to show that ubiquinol preserves mitochondria and reduces cellular injury severity after TBI, and support further study of ubiquinol as a promising adjunct therapy for TBI.

AB  - Abstract We have compared several serum-free media for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and assessed the extent of differentiation in several ways including as to active tension generation capability. C2C12 cells were allowed to differentiate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing Ham's F-12 (F-12), AIM-V (AIM), 0.2% Ultroser-G in DMEM (Ult-G), and 0.1% Sericin in DMEM (Sericin), compared with in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (HS) or 2% calf serum (CS). C2C12 differentiation was assessed as the extent of myotube formation, glucose metabolism, protein expression, sarcomere formation, and active tension generation. All serum-free media examined were capable of inducing myotube formation and the expression of muscle-specific proteins. All serum-free media except for F-12 gave the sarcomere structure. Active tension generation was observed for cells that differentiated in AIM and Ult-G, but the active tension generated by C2C12 cells that differentiated in Ult-G was only ?25% in the case of myotubes that formed in HS. The addition of Ult-G to the AIM resulted in improvement of the active tension generation capability, the active tension generated being ?3.4? compared to that in HS. The approach for assessing muscle cell differentiation presented in this study will be suitable for other studies that involve the differentiation of muscle cells. Biotechnol.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate perfusion index (PI) as a determinant of regional nerve block success following sciatic nerve blockade with bupivacaine in dogs undergoing stifle surgery. Study design Prospective clinical trial. Animals Ten adult dogs, aged 5.6 ± 2.6 years and weighing 36.9 ± 16.8 kg, undergoing a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Methods Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine (0.03 mg kg?1) and hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) intramuscularly, and anesthetized with propofol (up to 4 mg kg?1) intravenously and isoflurane in oxygen. An ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic (F+S) nerve block was performed on the surgical limb with bupivacaine (0.75%), 0.2 mL kg?1 at the femoral site and 0.3 mL kg?1 at the sciatic site, with a maximum volume of 10 mL per site. Physiological variables were recorded every 5 minutes throughout anesthesia. A pulse co-oximeter probe was placed between the third and fourth digits of both pelvic limbs, and the PI was recorded 5 minutes before infiltration with bupivacaine, immediately afterwards, and every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the sciatic nerve was performed on the surgical limb 5 minutes before and 20 minutes after bupivacaine administration to confirm nerve block. Results The PI of the surgical limb was significantly greater than the contralateral pelvic limb at 10 minutes (p = 0.03) and 15 minutes (p < 0.01) after F+S nerve blockade. The MNCV performed after sciatic nerve blockade revealed a functional motor blockade for all dogs. There were no significant changes in physiological variables. Conclusions and clinical relevance The PI provided a reliable indication of successful sciatic nerve blockade in the clinical patients in this study. No increase in the PI by 15 minutes after bupivacaine administration around the sciatic nerve could indicate partial or total failure of anesthetic blockade.

AB  - Abstract We have investigated the role of Ca2+ accumulation and neuronal injury in cerebellar granule neurons after glutamate receptor overactivation. After the removal of the free cytosolic Ca2+ we identified an extensive second Ca2+ fraction (SCF) that is retained within the neurons after glutamate receptor overactivation. The SCF reaches a plateau within 10?min with the magnitude of this SCF accumulation reflecting the extent of the neuronal injury that occurs within the neurons. The existence of this SCF is sensitive to both NMDA receptor antagonists and mitochondrial inhibitors but is unaffected by agents that deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, indicating that this Ca2+ fraction may be located within the mitochondria. Through the isolation of mitochondria from cerebellar granule neurons treated with glutamate we have shown that the majority of the SCF is mitochondrial in location. On the removal of the glutamate stimulus the SCF recovers at a slower rate than the free Ca2+ concentration within the neuron. This is intriguing, as it implies a capacity to remember previous excitatory events. Most significantly we have shown that a short pre-application of subthreshold glutamate or kainate blocks both SCF Ca2+ accumulation and extensive neuronal injury in response to high concentrations of glutamate. These findings may be relevant to the observations of pre-conditioning in the brain and heart.

AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor frequently used to improve cardiac output (CO) in man. As the use of enoximone has not been reported in horses, the effects of this inodilator were examined in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies. Study design? Prospective, randomised, experimental study. Animals? Six healthy ponies, weighing 286 (212?367)?±?52?kg, aged 5.0?±?1.6?years (4?6.5). Methods? After sedation with romifidine [80??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)], general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1 IV) and ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen (Et Iso 1.7%). The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia (PaCO2 4.66?6.00?kPa). Each pony was anaesthetized twice with an interval of 3?weeks; receiving enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E) or saline (S) 90?minutes post-induction. Heart rate (HR), arterial (AP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured before treatment, every 5?minutes between T0 (treatment) and T30 and then every 10?minutes until T120. Cardiac output measurements (lithium dilution technique) and blood gas analysis (arterial and central venous samples) were performed before T0 and at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), venous admixture (Q?s/Q?t) and oxygen delivery (?O2) were calculated. Results? Enoximone induced significant increases in HR, CO, SV, Q?s/Q?t and ?O2 and a significant decrease in RAP. No significant differences were detected for AP, SVR and blood gases. No cardiac arrhythmias or other side effects were observed. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The present results suggest that in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies, enoximone has beneficial effects on CO and SV without producing significant changes in blood pressure. Despite an increase in Q?s/Q?t, ?O2 to the tissues was improved.

AB  - Abstract Lewisite, a potent toxic vesicant and chemical warfare agent, is used in a number of research laboratories, is stored in large quantities at depot sites throughout the USA and is occasionally transported to distant sites. Thus, the potential for environmental or occupational exposure exists where lewisite is present. A 42-week two-generation study was conducted to determine the reproductive consequences of lewisite in parental male and female rats and their offspring. Rats were administered lewisite in sesame oil (0, 0.10, 0.25 or 0.60 mg kg?1 day?1 for 5 days a week) via intragastic intubation before mating, during mating and after mating until the birth of their offspring. The dams continued to receive lewisite during lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring of each group were selected to continue the study, receiving lewisite during adolescence, mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Lewisite had no adverse effect on reproduction performance, fertility or reproductive organ weights of male or female rats through two consecutive generations. No adverse effects to offspring were attributed to lewisite exposure. Minor changes in growth were the only maternal effects observed. Lewisite exposure of parental rats caused no gross or microscopic lesion in testes, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicles, ovaries, uterus or vagina. The no-observable-effect level (NOEL) for the reproductive effects of Lewisite would be >0.60 mg kg?1 day?1. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Preclinical studies for neurodegenerative diseases have shown a multi-targeted approach to be successful in the treatment of these complex disorders with several pathoetiological pathways. Polycyclic compounds, such as NGP1-01 (7a), have demonstrated the ability to target multiple mechanisms of the complex etiology and are referred to as multifunctional compounds. These compounds have served as scaffolds with the ability to attenuate Ca2+ overload and excitotoxicity through several pathways. In this study, our focus was on mitigating Ca2+ overload through the L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of several novel polycyclic compounds. We determined the IC50 values for both the pentacycloundecylamines and the triquinylamines by means of a high-throughput fluorescence calcium flux assay utilizing Fura-2/AM. The potential of these compounds to offer protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death was also evaluated. Overall, 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane (NGP1-01, 7a) had the most favorable pharmacological profile with an IC50 value of 86?µM for LTCC inhibition and significant reduction of hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. In general, the triquinylamines were more active as LTCC blockers than the oxa-pentacycloundecylamines. The aza-pentacycloundecylamines were potent LTCC inhibitors, with 8-hydroxy-N-phenylethyl-8,11-azapentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane (8b) also able to offer significant protection in the cell viability assays.

AB  - Aim: Effects of early excision on hepatic blood flow were investigated in burned rats. Methods: 30% TBSA burned Wistar rats were allocated to four groups, infusion group (n?=?13): fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer?s; early excision group (n?=?13): early escherectomy and allogenic skin grafting with fluid resuscitation; burn group (n?=?13): burn injury alone without any treatment; sham group (n?=?15): sham burn procedure. The hepatic blood flow was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours postburn. At 12 and 24 hours postburn, plasma Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were detected. Results: In the infusion and the burn group, a significant decrease in hepatic blood flow compared with the sham group. In contrast in the early excision group, the hepatic blood flow was not decreased and there was a significant difference from the infusion group at 12 hours postburn. The plasma ET-1 and NO levels were markedly elevated in the infusion and the burn group at 12 and 24 hours postburn. Whereas in the early excision group, no significant increase either in the plasma ET-1 or NO levels were found compared with the sham group during experimental period. Conclusion: The hepatic blood flow decreases after a massive burn injury even with adequate fluid resuscitation. Early excision is helpful in stabilizing the hepatic blood flow without further aggravating the hepatic hemodynamic load. The decrease in plasma ET-1 and NO levels after early wound excision procedure may be playing a role in improving the hepatic blood flow.

AB  - Summary This study reports the use of parathyroid hormone fragment peptide 1-34 (PTH1-34) cross-linked to a hydrogel in a fibrin base for the treatment of subchondral cyst-like lesions (SCLs). The objectives were to determine the clinical and radiographic outcome of 28 horses with lameness attributable to one or two SCLs treated locally with one of three different concentrations of PTH1-34 and to identify which concentration produces the best results. Twenty-eight horses (34 SCLs) were treated surgically by debriding the content of the SCL and injecting different concentrations (0.1, 0.4, or 1 mg/mL) of PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel into the cavity. Treatment was considered successful if the horse was sound 12 months after treatment. The mean age of the horses was 7.2 years. Treatment was successful in 22 (78.6%) horses and improved the radiographic appearance of 27 (79.4%) SCLs. The outcome was not affected by age of the horse or by the number of SCLs (1 or 2) per horse. PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel administered into the SCL after surgical debridement of the lesion appears to be an effective treatment for horses with one or two SCLs. A PTH1-34 concentration of 0.4 mg/mL may be slightly superior to concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL in resolving SCLs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate cardiopulmonary effects and anaesthesia recovery quality in horses anaesthetized with isoflurane receiving medetomidine or S-ketamine infusions. Study design Randomized, blinded, prospective clinical trial. Animals Fifty horses undergoing elective surgery. Methods After acepromazine and flunixin meglumine premedication, horses received medetomidine (7 ?g kg?1) intravenously (IV). Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and racemic ketamine (Med treatment group; 2.2 mg kg?1; n = 25) or S-ketamine (S-ket treatment group; 1.1 mg kg?1; n = 25) IV and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air and medetomidine (Med; 3.5 ?g kg?1 hour?1) or S-ketamine (S-ket; 0.5 mg kg?1 hour?1). All horses were mechanically ventilated. Cardiopulmonary variables were evaluated. Isoflurane end-tidal concentrations (Fe?Iso), dobutamine requirements and thiopental boli were recorded. Plasma samples were collected in six horses to evaluate S-ketamine and S-norketamine concentrations. After surgery, medetomidine 2 ?g kg?1 was administered IV. Four independent observers scored recovery using a visual analogue scale and a numerical rating scale. Results Both groups required similar mean Fe?Iso (1%). However, S-ket horses needed more thiopental boli. Median intraoperative cardiac index values were higher with S-ket (4.5 L minute?1 m?2) than Med (3.9 L minute?1 m?2). Overall, there were no differences in heart rate, blood pressure or dobutamine requirements; however, horses in S-ket showed higher heart rate values at 30 minutes after anaesthesia induction. Compared with Med horses, S-ket horses showed decreased PaO2 and increased pulmonary venous admixture values estimated with the Fshunt calculation. Recoveries were shorter and of poorer quality with S-ket. During infusion, S-ketamine and S-norketamine plasma concentrations lay in the ranges of 0.209?0.917 ?g mL?1 and 0.250?0.723 ?g mL?1, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite the higher intraoperative cardiac index with S-ket, both protocols were considered to provide acceptable cardiovascular function. However, recovery quality was significantly better in the Med group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Human carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated sarcomeric mutations have abnormal collagen metabolism before overt left ventricular hypertrophy is detectable. This study investigated whether differences in collagen biomarkers were present in blood samples of ragdoll cats positive for the MYBPC3:R820W mutation compared with negative controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS Linear regression analyses showed that genotype was independently associated with CITP concentration. CITP was higher in mutation carriers (25?·?4?µg/L, interquartile range 16?·?0?29?·?2?µg/L) than non-carriers (14?·?6?µg/L, interquartile range 9?·?38?19?·?2?µg/L; P?=?0?·?024). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Circulating CITP was higher in MYBPC3-positive ragdoll cats than negative controls and may indicate altered collagen metabolism. Further studies are necessary to determine whether alterations in circulating collagen biomarker concentration relate to an early stage of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
