AB  - Pregnancy in one of the most frequent physiological conditions associated with CTS. During 2000, the Italian CTS study group (participants: T.Carboni-San Benedetto del Tronto, S.Massi-San Giovanni Valdarno; M.Mondelli-Siena, A.Morini-Trento, D.Murasecco-Perugia, L.Padua-Roma, M.Romano-Palermo) studied the incidence of CTS in pregnancy in women enrolled in 7 Italian centers. CTS was diagnosed clinically in 62% and neurophysiologically in 43% of women. During 2001, 12 and 15 month follow-up evaluation was performed. The aims were to evaluate: 1) evolution of CTS after delivery and lactation; 2) predictive value of electrodiagnostic assessment and clinical picture at the time of the first diagnosis. An extensive and complete description of the study design was previously reported. Evolution was assessed on the following CTS severity measurements: SYMPT, FUNCT, PAIN, Hi-Ob and neurophysiologic class. Overall, at follow up, 20 of 37 women (54%) who presented clinical CTS at first evaluation had clinical CTS. All patient-oriented measurements showed significant improvement of CTS. Conversely, neurophysiologic findings did not differ between baseline and follow-up. Although CTS severity measurements improved at follow-up, more than half of women with CTS symptoms during pregnancy complained of CTS symptoms one year after delivery. Moreover, the onset of symptoms during pregnancy was the most predictive factor for untreated CTS evolution. All patient-oriented and clinical measurements showed that an earlier onset of symptoms was a negative prognostic factor. According to the neurophysiologic evolution, weight gain appeared predictive: an higher gain implied a lower probability of improvement at follow-up examination.

AB  - Abstract This is an updated guideline for the diagnosis and management of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, first published in 2007. It was produced by the Standards of Care Committee of the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, using accredited methods. Allergic rhinitis is common and affects 10?15% of children and 26% of adults in the UK, it affects quality of life, school and work attendance, and is a risk factor for development of asthma. Allergic rhinitis is diagnosed by history and examination, supported by specific allergy tests. Topical nasal corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for moderate to severe disease. Combination therapy with intranasal corticosteroid plus intranasal antihistamine is more effective than either alone and provides second line treatment for those with rhinitis poorly controlled on monotherapy. Immunotherapy is highly effective when the specific allergen is the responsible driver for the symptoms. Treatment of rhinitis is associated with benefits for asthma. Non-allergic rhinitis also is a risk factor for the development of asthma and may be eosinophilic and steroid-responsive or neurogenic and non- inflammatory. Non-allergic rhinitis may be a presenting complaint for systemic disorders such as granulomatous or eosinophilic polyangiitis, and sarcoidoisis. Infective rhinitis can be caused by viruses, and less commonly by bacteria, fungi and protozoa.

AB  - This interview with the Irish artist Alice Maher raises questions around issues of Irishness, gender and hybridity in contemporary practice. Shifts in Maher's work from Neo-Expressionist painting in the mid-1980s to a more inclusive range of practices such as drawing, object-making or installation are also situated in relation to an ongoing project of the deconstruction of reductive tropes of Irish ethnicity. Her early work in Belfast involved a confrontation of the difficulties for a Southern Irish Catholic to position herself in relation to the ongoing political conflict in Northern Ireland. Neo-Expressionism is discussed as a strategy for the resistance to the oppressive treatment of Irish women by the Catholic Church. Maher's concern with female identity in this context then involved a shift towards an oblique engagement with Irish ethnicity through a concern with the multi-layered significance of landscape, focused around a series of site-specific works executed in France in the mid-1990s. These works have, in turn, for Maher, developed into a hybrid practice as a means of articulating more nuanced readings of Irish identity. The materials used in recent work ? hair, tears, lambs' tongues ? however, represent both a selective engagement with the abject and a performance of the primitive ? a problematic area in terms of the ethnocentric categorizations of Irish femininity, yet one of whose contradictions Maher is fully aware.

AB  - An experimental study was performed using C14 proline uptake in order to: (1) assess the effects of current sterilization and storage methods on fibroblast viability, and (2) establish a control tissue that could be used to determine viability of each homograft valve at the time of impiantation in the clinical setting. The results were expressed as disintegrations per minute per milligram of tissue (DPM/mg). Swine aortic (AV), pulmonary (PV), and tricuspid leaflets (TV), and adjacent AV and PV arterial wall were procured sterile and subjected to routine sterilization and storage. Thirty samples of AV were analyzed for incorporation of labeled proline at procurement (208 ± 7 DPM/mg), following 48-hour antibiotic exposure (87 ± 6 DPM/mg, P < .0001), and following controlled rate cryopreservation and storage for 12 days at ?80°C (78 ± 8 DPM/mg, P = .42). Proline uptake of the other tissues at the same intervais disclosed that only the TV resulted in the same degree of viability at implantation (AV 78 ± 8, PV 68 ± 3, TV 75 ± 2, P = NS). The homograft valves were obtained under sterile conditions from brain dead, multi-organ donors (homovital). It has been postulated that these valves are sterile and ready for implantation. Of 17 homovital valves cultured at procurement, 9 had positive cultures within 48 hours (53%). We conclude that: (1) the TV can be processed as a control tissue with each homograft and then utilized to predict viability at the time of implantation in the clinical setting; (2) antibiotic exposure is an essential step in the preparation of all homografts, however, modification of the antibiotic solution is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Cellulite, highly prevalent among women, represents a serious problem for many of them, and one of their main aesthetic concerns. It is difficult to pinpoint its aetiology and physiology/pathophysiology, as there are many factors that are involved in it, affect it, and many processes that are taking place simultaneously and sequentially. Our objective is therefore, to review the scientific scholarship on cellulite to explore the causes of its origin. We carried out a preliminary search of the Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Knowledge databases covering the period from 1978 to April 2011. As there is no specific key word for the phenomenon at hand, we used the following descriptors: adipose tissue, subcutaneous fat, subcutaneous tissue, connective tissue, skin, skin disease and dermis. This resulted in a retrieval of 26 articles contributing to relevant information on the aetiology of cellulite. As a result of our first research, we concluded that cellulite is a physiological phenomenon or at least, that it has a physiological origin, which is characteristic of women, and multi-causal, with the coexistence of a number of factors that trigger, perpetuate, or exacerbate it. The outstanding factors include, among others, connective tissue architecture, oestrogen action, microvascular alterations and certain genetic and hormonal characteristics. All of them provide us with future and novel clues to cellulite treatment, and is necessary to take some or all of these factors into account in developing an effective therapy. However, we are aware of the necessity of further investigation in this field.

AB  - Aim:? The specific incidence of ischemic hepatitis in septic shock patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of ischemic hepatitis in septic shock and its relationship with mortality. Methods:? We retrospectively studied 181 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We defined ischemic hepatitis as having a value of serum aminotransferases equal to or higher than 1000?IU/L. We recorded the age, sex, comorbidity, site of infection, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission to the ICU, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy. Results:? Twenty-five (13.8%) patients developed ischemic hepatitis. In-hospital mortality was 57% (103 patients). In the ischemic hepatitis group, mortality increased up to 84.0% (21 patients) compared with 52.6% (82 patients) in patients without ischemic hepatitis (control group) (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6?14.4; P?=?0.003). The development of ischemic hepatitis, age, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy were independently associated with an increased risk of death. The odds of death increased by 247% in ischemic hepatitis (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.02?11.8; P?=?0.047). Conclusion:? Ischemic hepatitis is a common complication in septic shock patients, associated with a high mortality.

AB  - Summary The economics of healthcare today challenge clinical laboratories nationwide to provide quality service and patient results in spite of decreasing resources. Decreasing reimbursement for patient testing and dwindling staff resources require the laboratorian to ?do more with less.? One must be aware of one's professional environment and be creative to utilize the existing resources effectively and efficiently. In many cases, this will require a laboratory environment of constant and major change. This chapter addresses some of these issues and their financial implications. Automation, computerization, point-of- care testing (POCT), and robotics will allow a more integrated, systemwide approach to providing high-quality laboratory services in support of patient care. Laboratory networks and multi-hospital systems may achieve economies of scale. There has been a steady increase in regulatory control of the healthcare industry by both federal and state governments. This increase in regulation extends to all clinical laboratories supporting both inpatients and outpatients. Government compliance regulations as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) rules have resulted in unplanned expenses for clinical laboratories and hospitals to modify existing computer systems and even add personnel to help meet the regulations.

AB  - Summary Background Small intestinal strangulating obstruction (SISO) is associated with endotoxaemia which leads to an increased risk of death. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat signs of endotoxaemia by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases (COX). COX-1 is expressed constitutively and promotes gut barrier function, whereas COX-2 is inducible and contributes to the signs of endotoxaemia. In preclinical SISO trials, intestinal barrier recovery was more complete with reductions in endotoxin permeability in horses treated with COX-2 selective NSAIDs as compared with horses treated with flunixin meglumine. Objectives We hypothesised that treatment of post-surgical SISO horses with firocoxib (COX-2 selective) would reduce the signs of endotoxaemia to a greater extent than flunixin meglumine (nonselective COX inhibitor) while continuing to provide similar levels of pain control. Study design Blinded randomised clinical trial. Methods In addition to clinical monitoring, preoperative and 12-, 24- and 48-h post-operative plasma samples were assessed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), TNF? and soluble CD14 (sCD14). Results In 56 recruited SISO horses, either flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg, i.v., q12h) or firocoxib (0.3 mg/kg, i.v. loading dose; 0.1 mg/kg, i.v., q24h) was given in the post-operative period in three university hospitals from 2015 to 2017. COX-2 selectivity was confirmed by a relative lack of inhibition of the COX-1 prostanoid TXB2 by firocoxib and significant inhibition by flunixin meglumine (P = 0.014). Both drugs inhibited the COX-2 prostanoid PGE2. There were no significant differences in pain scores between groups (P = 0.2). However, there was a 3.23-fold increased risk (P = 0.04) of increased plasma sCD14 in horses treated with flunixin meglumine, a validated biomarker of equine endotoxaemia. Main limitations Horses were all treated with flunixin meglumine prior to referral. In addition, many horses were treated with lidocaine, which has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of flunixin meglumine. Conclusions In SISO cases, firocoxib reduced a biomarker of endotoxaemia as compared with flunixin meglumine while continuing to provide similar levels of pain control.

AB  - Abstract To date, it is not known whether the seasonal occurrence of sexual behavior and mating in free-ranging Hanuman langurs at Ramnagar, Nepal, is correlated with seasonal changes in female ovarian function, and, if so, which factor(s) triggers the onset of the reproductive period. Using non-invasive fecal hormone analysis in combination with behavioral observations, this study was carried out to: 1) investigate and characterize seasonal patterns of ovarian cyclicity and timing of conception in wild langur females living in a highly seasonal habitat; and 2) examine the relationship between seasonal patterns of ovarian cyclicity, behavioral estrus, and female physical condition. Behavioral data and fecal samples were collected during a total period of 14 months from nine females living in a multi-male group. Physical condition of the females was assessed monthly by visual inspection, using a seven-fold scale. Ovulatory cycles and timing of conceptions were identified by the measurement of immunoreactive pregnanediol glucuronide (iPdG) in extracted feces. Hormone profiles in individual females revealed a clearly seasonal distribution in the occurrence of ovulatory cycles, which were restricted to the period from July to October. The distribution of female estrus behavior showed a similar seasonal pattern, and in total 88.2% of all estrus periods observed in the focal females were accompanied by ovulation. Onset of ovarian cycles as well as mating activities were strongly correlated with the onset of the rainy season. Females conceived, on average, in their second ovulatory cycle (pregnancy length: 211.6 ± 3.4 days), with timing of conception being confined to the months when animals showed an improved physical condition. Collectively the present data clearly suggest that in seasonally-breeding langurs at Ramnagar, ecological conditions (rainfall, food availability, and quality) influence the onset of ovulations and timing of conceptions.

AB  - Abstract Probe techniques for monitoring in vivo chemistry (e.g., electrochemical sensors and microdialysis sampling probes) have significantly contributed to a better understanding of neurotransmission in correlation to behaviors and neurological disorders. Microfabrication allows construction of neural probes with high reproducibility, scalability, design flexibility, and multiplexed features. This technology has translated well into fabricating miniaturized neurochemical probes for electrochemical detection and sampling. Microfabricated electrochemical probes provide a better control of spatial resolution with multisite detection on a single compact platform. This development allows the observation of heterogeneity of neurochemical activity precisely within the brain region. Microfabricated sampling probes are starting to emerge that enable chemical measurements at high spatial resolution and potential for reducing tissue damage. Recent advancement in analytical methods also facilitates neurochemical monitoring at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, a positive feature of microfabricated probes is that they can be feasibly built with other sensing and stimulating platforms including optogenetics. Such integrated probes will empower researchers to precisely elucidate brain function and develop novel treatments for neurological disorders.

Explain the principles of multidisciplinary management of Ewing's sarcoma. Discuss the late effects of the therapy for Ewing's sarcoma. Access and take the CME test online and receive 1 AMA PRA category 1 credit at CME.TheOncologist.com Ewing's sarcoma is the second most frequent primary bone cancer, with approximately 225 new cases diagnosed each year in patients less than 20 years of age in North America. It is one of the pediatric small round blue cell tumors, characterized by strong membrane expression of CD99 in a chain-mail pattern and negativity for lymphoid (CD45), rhabdomyosarcoma (myogenin, desmin, actin) and neuroblastoma (neurofilament protein) markers. Pathognomonic translocations involving the ews gene on chromosome 22 and an ets-type gene, most commonly the fli1 gene on chromosome 11, are implicated in the great majority of cases. Clinical presentation is usually dominated by local bone pain and a mass. Imaging reveals a technetium pyrophosphate avid lesion that, on plain radiograph, is destructive, diaphyseal and classically causes layered periosteal calcification. Magnetic resonance best defines the extent of the lesion. Biopsy should be undertaken by an experienced orthopedic oncologist. Approximately three quarters of patients have initially localized disease. About two thirds survive disease-free. Management, preferably at a specialist center with a multi-disciplinary team, includes both local control?either surgery, radiation or a combination?and systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy includes cyclic combinations, incorporating vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, ifosfamide and occasionally actinomycin D. Topotecan in combination with cyclophosphamide has shown preliminary activity. Patients with initially metastatic disease fare less well, with about one quarter surviving. Studies incorporating intensive therapy followed by stem cell infusion show no clear benefit. New approaches include anti-angiogenic therapy, particularly since vascular endothelial growth factor is an apparent downstream target of the ews-fli1 oncogene.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To investigate the transfer of rac-tramadol and its rac-O-desmethyl metabolite into transitional milk, to estimate the absolute and relative infant doses via milk, and to assess unwanted effects in the breastfed infant. Methods:? Tramadol HCl (100?mg six hourly) was administered to 75 breastfeeding mothers for postoperative analgesia on days 2?4 after caesarian section. Three samples of transitional milk and one of plasma were collected over 6?14 h following the 4th dose. Tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Milk/plasma ratio (M/P) was calculated, and absolute infant dose and relative infant dose were calculated by standard methods. The behavioral characteristics of the exposed breastfed infants and a matched control group of infants not exposed to tramadol were also studied. Results:? Mean (95% CI) M/P was 2.2 (2.0?2.4) for tramadol and 2.8 (2.5?3.1) for O-desmethyltramadol. Average concentrations in milk across a 6 h dose interval at steady-state were 748 (681?815) mcg l?1 for tramadol and 203 (188?217) mcg l?1for O-desmethyltramadol. Estimated absolute and relative infant doses were 112 (102?122) mcg?kg?1 day?1 and 30 (28?32) mcg?kg?1 day?1, and 2.24 (2.04?2.44)% and 0.64 (0.59?0.69)% for tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol respectively. The exposed infants and control breastfed infants had similar characteristics, including Apgar scores at birth and Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) on days 3?4 after birth. Conclusions:? The absolute infant doses for tramadol and its active metabolite combined were around 14% of the child therapeutic dose for tramadol. The combined relative infant dose of 2.88% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose was also low. The similarity of NACS in exposed infants and controls suggests that there were no clinically significant effects on infant well-being. We conclude that short-term maternal use of tramadol during establishment of lactation is safe for the breastfed infant.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Objective To assess the usefulness of voice quality measurements as a treatment outcome in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)-related symptoms. Design Prospective uncontrolled multi-centre study. Material and methods A total of 80 clinically diagnosed LPR patients with a reflux finding score (RFS)>7 and a reflux symptom index (RSI)>13 were treated with pantoprazole and diet recommendations during 3 or 6 months, according to their evolution. RSI; RFS; blinded Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain and Instability (GRBASI) and aerodynamic and acoustic measurements were evaluated at baseline, 3 months (n = 80), and 6 months (n = 41) post-treatment. We conducted a correlation analysis between the adherence to the diet, and the evolution of both signs and symptoms and between videolaryngostroboscopic signs and acoustic measurements. Results Reflux symptom index, RFS, perceptual voice quality evaluations (dysphonia, roughness, strain and instability), and aerodynamic and acoustic measurements (ie, percent jitter and percent shimmer) were significantly improved at 3 months post-treatment but not at 6 months. Percent jitter was the most useful outcome for evaluating the clinical evolution of patients throughout the treatment course. A significant relationship between globus sensation and posterior commissure hypertrophy was documented; both seemed to significantly improve from 3 to 6 months. The correlation analysis revealed correlations between adherence to diet recommendations and the improvement of symptoms and between posterior commissure granulation severity and acoustic measurement impairments. Conclusion Voice quality improved in a manner similar to both signs and symptoms throughout a 6-month empirical treatment with better improvement the 3 first months. Voice quality assessments can be used as indicators of treatment effectiveness in patients with LPR-related symptoms.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.
