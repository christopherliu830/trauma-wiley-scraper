AB  - Background Porcine ulcerative dermatitis syndrome (PUDS) is a rare disease of breeding sows with an unknown pathogenesis. Objective To describe the evolution of clinical and histopathological lesions over the course of the disease and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Animal A 24-month-old, pluriparous, large white sow presented during gestation with ulcerations around the teats compatible with PUDS. Methods and results Clinical and histopathological lesions were monitored over the course of the disease (i.e. during and after the subsequent pregnancy). A clear gestation-dependent flare of the lesions was observed with partial resolution occurring postpartum. The histological pattern presented as a lymphocytic interface dermatitis. Conclusions and clinical importance The findings in this case report link gestation with the development of clinical signs and histological changes. Multiparity appears to enhance severity and may finally result in a self-perpetuating disease. Therefore, it seems advisable to cull breeding sows after they have developed PUDS.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? Many trace elements play important roles in activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, by competing with other elements and metalloproteins for binding sites, by affecting the permeability of cell membranes and by other mechanisms. They play important roles in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. As such, trace elements are thought to be involved directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect trace elements (Se, Mn and Zn) intravenously administered on the period the COPD patients spend on mechanical ventilation. Methods:? In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial a set of 120 subjects (40 normal volunteers and 80 COPD) were recruited. Serum concentration levels of Se, Mn and Zn were determined for all enrolled subjects with Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. COPD patients received intravenous supplementation of the above trace elements and the period the patients spent on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results:? There was a significant reduction (P?=?0.013) in the period the patients with COPD spent on the mechanical ventilation when received intravenous supplementation (9.4?±?7.3?days) compared with the COPD patients who received placebo (17.8?±?7.6?days). Conclusions:? Trace element (Se, Mn and Zn) status is altered in critically ill patients with COPD. The supplementation achieved a reduction in the period those patients spent on the mechanical ventilation. A larger multi-centre trial is required to confirm this preventive effect and to explore its applicability to other critical care conditions.

AB  - Abstract Microglia have diverse actions, ranging from synapse pruning in development to cytotoxic effects in disease. Brain energy metabolism and substrate availability vary under normal and disease states, but how these variations influence microglial function is relatively unknown. Microglia, like most other cell types, express the full complement of gene products required for both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. Evidence suggests that microglia increase aerobic glycolysis and decrease respiration when activated by various stimuli. Mitochondrial function, glucose availability, and glycolytic rate influence pro-inflammatory gene expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. These effects are mediated through CtBP, an NADH?sensitive transcriptional co-repressor; through effects on NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation; through formation of advanced glycation end-products; and by less well-defined mechanisms. In addition to these transcriptional effects, microglial glucose metabolism is also required for superoxide production by NADPH oxidase, as glucose is the obligate substrate for regenerating NADPH in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Microglia also metabolize acetoacetate and ?-hydroxybutyrate, which are generated during fasting or ketogenic diet, and respond to these ketones as metabolic signals. ?-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits histone de-acetylases and activates microglial GRP109A receptors. These actions suppress microglia activation after brain injury and promote neuroprotective microglia phenotypes. As our understanding of microglial activation matures, additional links between energy metabolism and microglial function are likely to be identified.

AB  - Summary Studies published in recent years have highlighted the role of epidermal barrier defects in both atopic skin disease and the development of broader allergic manifestations. While genetic determinants of barrier function are important, it is clear that local acquired effects are also involved in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we aimed to summarize the known influences of cytokines abundantly expressed during atopic skin disease on components of epidermal barrier integrity and function.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dynamin-1-like protein (DNM1L) gene variants have been linked to childhood refractory epilepsy, developmental delay, encephalopathy, microcephaly, and progressive diffuse cerebral atrophy. However, only a few cases have been reported in the literature and there is still a limited amount of information about the symptomatology and pathophysiology associated with pathogenic variants of DNM1L. We report a 10-year-old girl with a one-year history of mild learning disorder and absence seizures who presented with new-onset focal status epilepticus which progressed to severe encephalopathy and asymmetric hemispheric cerebral atrophy. Differential diagnosis included mitochondrial disease, Rasmussen's encephalitis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Disease progressed from one hemisphere to the other despite anti-seizure medications, hemispherectomy, vagus nerve stimulator, ketogenic diet, and immunomodulators. Continued cerebral atrophy and refractory seizures evolved until death four years after initial presentation. Post-mortem whole-exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic DNM1L variant. This paper presents a novel case of adolescent-onset DNM1L-related intractable epilepsy and encephalopathy.

AB  - Summary This guidance for the management of patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis has been prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI). The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is for use by both adult physicians and paediatricians practicing in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking, consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification of rhinitis, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations and management including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy. There are also special sections for children, co-morbid associations and pregnancy. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.

AB  - SUMMARY Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) continues to be an important therapy for treatment of anemia in intensive care settings. The critically ill are a heterogeneous population affected by a variety of pathophysiological processes and are, therefore, predisposed to the ? adverse outcomes of anemia. As such, the risks imposed on this population when transfusion therapy is prescribed are of great interest. Over the past decade there has been a shift in transfusion practice with guidelines being developed that promote more conservative and safer use of blood. The Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial clearly established the safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy, thereby suggesting that physicians could easily minimize exposure to allogeneic RBCs by lowering their transfusion threshold. Further research will add to the generalizability of this study as well as explore the possible mechanism to explain why red cell transfusions did not improve outcomes in the critically ill.

AB  - Adhesions are a common and unfortunate consequence of most abdominal surgical operations, which start to form within three hours of surgery. Some patients form extensive permanent adhesions that can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the extent of this problem and the cost to the Health Service, and although there are numerous approaches to prevent adhesion formation by careful laparoscopic or microsurgical techniques or the use of various adhesion barriers, no method so far has proved completely efficacious in randomised controlled trials. This article reviews the pathogenesis of adhesions, the epidemiological data and the various methods used to try to prevent their formation.

AB  - Summary Cattle are robust animals that are quite capable of surviving in a wide variety of environmental conditions, and do so in many parts of the world. Dairy cows present the biggest housing challenge, as their health and welfare are very significantly affected by building design and function, and these needs change with the various stages of their lactation cycle. The basic underlying principles of housing are the same for all types of cattle, and it is only the detail that differs. A useful methodology when performing a housing audit is to consider three approaches such as standard specifications, measurables and animal measurables. Standard specification includes moisture, ventilation and space requirements. For an audit of actual animal measurables, one need to look at body condition score (BCS), lying times and comfort measurements, and specific injury scores.

AB  - Abstract Background This study compares diamond burs and curettes by clinical, microbiological, biochemical and scanning electron microscopic parameters and treatment time data in the non-surgical periodontal treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis. Methods Two quadrants of each of the 12 patients received root planing with diamond burs, whereas the other two quadrants were treated with curettes. Clinical periodontal measurements were recorded at baseline and then 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment. Subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month control. Twenty-one hopeless teeth received root planing with diamond burs or curettes or no treatment and then extracted for microscopic evaluations. Results Clinical periodontal parameters improved similarly with both treatment modalities. Microbiological analyses revealed similar findings for the bacterial load (16S gene copy numbers) and ratio of each bacterium to the total bacterial count at baseline and 1-month control. Cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid samples exhibited differences between the two treatments. Scanning electron microscopic analyses indicated that diamond burs were better in terms of calculus removal and loss of tooth substance indices but roughness index values were better for curettes. Conclusions Diamond burs provide findings comparable with curettes in root planing.

The attractive performance of the new enzyme logic biosensors holds considerable promise for diverse practical and important future applications, including novel forensic and security applications. The chapter describes how the biomedical analysis can benefit from the use of biomolecular information processing (biocomputing) systems. Forensic analysis of biofluids can benefit from novel bioanalytical/biosensing methods, including those based on the biocomputing approach. The chapter also overviews the application of binary biosensing methods based on the enzyme logic gates to various types of injury biomarkers, particularly concentrating on battlefield injuries. It shows that the simplest logic processing based mostly on logic AND/OR gates, applied to biochemical input signals.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
