AB  - In comparison to hypotonia, hypertonia is less commonly expressed in the neonatal period. The scientific literature on the causes of neonatal hypertonia is scant, with no suggested diagnostic algorithm easily available to clinicians. Aetiologies include conditions affecting the central nervous system and spine, and rare peripheral neuromuscular disorders leading to hypertonia. Aetiology onset may be antepartum, peripartum with either transient hypertonia or persistent hypertonia which may appear later, or from a postnatal event/disease. This review discusses neonatal hypertonia and a diagnostic approach to neonatal hypertonia is suggested.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RNAi knock down of CDK5 reduced the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and prevented neuronal loss in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice. Here, we report that CDK5 RNAi protected against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity using primary hippocampal neurons transduced with adeno-associated virus 2.5 viral vector eGFP-tagged scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR during 12 days. Protection was dependent on a concomitant increase in p35 and was reversed using p35 RNAi, which affected the down-stream Rho GTPase activity. Furthermore, p35 over-expression and constitutively active Rac1 mimicked CDK5 silencing-induced neuroprotection. In addition, 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease mice (24 months old) were injected in the hippocampus with scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR, and spatial learning and memory were performed 3 weeks post-injection using ?Morris? water maze test. Our data showed that CDK5 knock down induced an increase in p35 protein levels and Rac activity in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice, which correlated with the recovery of cognitive function; these findings confirm that increased p35 and active Rac are involved in neuroprotection. In summary, our data suggest that p35 acts as a mediator of Rho GTPase activity and contributes to the neuroprotection induced by CDK5 RNAi. CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that p35/Rac1 signaling is critical in the CDK5 shRNAmiR-induced neuroprotection against glutamate neurotoxicity and is also correlated with the recovery of cognitive function in 3xTg-AD mice. CDK5 shRNAmiR blocks calpain activation, and the cleavage of p35 to p25 produced by glutamate, which generates neuroprotection in a p35 up-regulation dependent mode and its down-stream control of Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Maternal effects may be a major factor influencing the demography of populations. In mammals, the transmission of stress hormones between mother and offspring may play an important role in these effects. Laboratory studies have shown that stressors during pregnancy and lactation result in lifelong programming of the offspring phenotype. However, the relevance of these studies to free-living mammals is unclear. The 10-year snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle is intimately linked to fluctuating predation pressure and predation risk. The enigma of these cycles is the lack of population growth following the decline phase, when the predators have virtually all disappeared and the food supply is ample. We have shown that a predator-induced increase in maternal stress hormone levels resulted in a decline in reproduction. Here we examine population and hormone changes over a four-year period from the increase (2005) to the decline (2008). We report (1) that an index of maternal stress (fecal corticosteroid metabolite [FCM] concentrations) fluctuates in synchrony with predator density during the breeding season; (2) that maternal FCM levels are echoed in their offspring, and this occurs at a population-wide level; and (3) that higher maternal FCM levels at birth are correlated with an increased responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in their progeny. Our results show an intergenerational inheritance of stress hormones in a free-ranging population of mammals. We propose that the lack of recovery of reproductive rates during the early low phase of the hare cycle may be the result of the impacts of intergenerational, maternally inherited stress hormones caused by high predation risk during the decline phase.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review clinically relevant features of systemic oxygen delivery and consumption and the technique and use of venous oxygenation monitoring in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources Veterinary and human peer-reviewed medical literature including scientific reviews, clinical and laboratory research articles, and authors? clinical research experience. Summary Measurement of venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (venous oxygenation) provides insight into the balance between oxygen supply and tissue demand. In people, measurement of venous oxygen saturation can reveal decompensation that is missed by physical examination and other routinely monitored parameters. Therefore, measurement of mixed or central venous oxygenation measurement may help guide therapy and predict outcome of critically ill patients. In dogs, low central venous oxygen saturation has been associated with impaired cardiopulmonary function and poor outcome in several small studies of experimental shock or severe clinical illness, suggesting that monitoring this variable may assist the treatment of severe illness in this species as well. Conclusion Venous oxygenation reflects systemic oxygenation status and can be used to guide treatment and estimate prognosis in critically ill patients. Measurement of venous oxygenation in veterinary patients is feasible and is a potentially valuable tool in the management of patients with severe disease. This review is intended to increase the understanding and awareness of the potential role of venous oxygen measurement in veterinary patients.

AB  - Abstract Minimum intervention dentistry (MID) is the modern medical approach to the management of caries, utilizing caries risk assessment, and focusing on the early prevention and interception of disease. Moving the focus away from the restoration of teeth allows the dentist to achieve maximum intervention, with minimal invasive treatments. The four core principles of MID can be considered to be: (1) Recognition ? early identification and assessment of potential caries risk factors through lifestyle analysis, saliva testing and using plaque diagnostic tests; (2) Reduction ? to eliminate or minimize caries risk factors by altering diet and lifestyle habits and increasing the pH of the oral environment; (3) Regeneration ? to arrest and reverse incipient lesions, using appropriate topical agents including fluorides and casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphates (CPP-ACP); (4) Repair ? when cavitation is present and surgical intervention is required, conservative caries removal is carried out to maximize the repair potential of the tooth and retain tooth structure. Bioactive materials are used to restore the tooth and promote internal healing of the dentine. Effective implementation of MID involves integrating each of these four elements into patient assessment and treatment planning. This review paper discusses the key principles of MID as a philosophy of patient care, and the practical objectives which flow into individual patient care.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - Although myocardial injury can be a significant component of multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in association with septicemia in critically ill human patients, it is as yet an undefined clinical entity in equine septicemia. With septicemia as the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MODS will be important in further improving survival rates. We designed a prospective study to establish normal ranges for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), T (cTnT) and CKMB mass in healthy 24?48 hour old foals, as well as septicemic neonatal foals seen over a 2-year period in a teaching hospital. We also performed a comparison of these biomarkers in surviving and non-surviving septicemic foals. Sepsis was judged on the basis of the presence of any of the 3 following criteria: blood culture positive at admission, admission sepsis score ≥11, or 3 or more sites of infection during hospitalization in foals ≤14 days of age. cTnI was measured by the ACCESS? (Beckman Coulter), cTnT was measured using the Elecsys 2010? Immunoassay (Roche), and CKMB mass measurements were performed using the Elecsys 2010?. Each parameter was described using range and 95th and 50th percentile. Comparisons were made for each parameter between normal and septic foals as well as surviving and non-surviving septic foals using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was set at p<0.05. There were 52 control foals and 38 septic foals of which 22 survived. Significant differences were documented for CKMB between septicemic and normal foals, but not for cTnT or cTnI. However, CKMB and cTnT were significantly lower in surviving versus non-surviving septicemic foals. The 50th and 95th percentiles alongside the ranges for the normal foal population were 0.14, 0.49, (0.01?0.51)??g/L for cTnI, 0.009, 0.03, (0.009?0.04)??g/L for cTnT and 2.3, 7.4, (0.4?9.3)??g/L for CKMB. Our findings suggest that myocardial injury is a component of MODS during septicemia in foals, and that quantitatively significant increases in CKMB and cTnT are seen in non-surviving septicemic foals versus survivors.

AB  - While potent analgesic agents, opioids reduce intestinal transport in the intestine, thereby increasing transit times and the potential for impaction colic. Methylnaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, does not reverse the analgesic effects of morphine, and directly stimulates isolated smooth muscle strips in humans. Objective: To determine if N-methynaltrexone has an effect on contractile activity of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure. Study Design: In vitro investigation using isolated circular smooth muscle strips. Animals: 8 adult horses (n=200 muscle strips). Methods: Increasing concentrations of N-methylnaltrexone were added to tissue baths in the range of 1?10?9?M to 1?10?5?M, and contractile responses were recorded for 3 minutes. Data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with statistical significance as P<0.05. Results: The administration of N-methylnaltrexone significantly increased the contractile frequency and amplitude at all concentrations relative to baseline (P <0.0001) for the jejunum. The response was greatest at 1?10?7?M (P=0.0005) with a mean difference from baseline of 0.341?mg/cm2. The highest concentration evaluated (1?10?5?M) had a mean contractile strength of 0.206?mg/cm2 which was significantly greater than baseline activity (P=0.04). A significant increase in contractile activity for the colon was detected at 3?10?6?M (P=0.027) and 1?10?5?M (P=0.002). Clinical Relevance: Potentially, this agent could be used in conjunction with morphine to provide more potent and effective analgesia without compromising intestinal function.

AB  - A new closure technique developed for lateral thoracotomy approaches in emergency surgeries was used to close 20 thoracotomies in 5 cats and 15 dogs, and the results were compared retrospectively to a previously recommended and published technique. The continuous shoe-lace technique involved the use of monofilament 2?0 (cats) to 2 sized (large dogs) polypropylene on a swaged on taper needle. The closure pattern began at the dorsal aspect of the intercostal opening just caudal to the caudal rib and then moved to just cranial to the cranial rib. The pattern continued in a continuous fashion, placing a suture bite every 1?2?cm (cats) to every 3?4?cm (large dogs). At the ventral aspect of the incision, the closure continued back dorsally with a continuous lacing-like pattern. At the conclusion of the pattern dorsally the sutures on each side of the incision were pulled tight. The opening between the ribs was brought together with this tightening. The single knot was then tied. Results revealed a more rapid closure than the conventional closure (averaging 10?minutes versus 20?minutes, respectively). No dehiscence was observed with either technique. The single knot was able to be tied without any difficulty. No other complications were observed. This study proved that the new closure technique was very effective. It is recommended over the routine previously accepted and published method because of increased speed and less suture material buried. This is especially helpful in emergency surgery where surgery time needs to be as short as possible.

AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACE) is a phenothiazine derivative used for its sedative properties. The primary mechanism of action of ACE is through inhibition of dopaminergic-2 receptors in the brain. It is a common belief that ACE lowers the seizure threshold. The purpose of this clinical study is to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of seizures in dogs presenting with a history of seizures that were treated with ACE during hospitalization. A retrospective review of records from dogs that had a chronic or acute seizure history and received ACE was done. Factors evaluated included the presenting complaint, historical seizure information, ACE dosage and route of administration, reason for giving and length of hospitalization following ACE, occurrence of seizure activity post-ACE administration, time interval between ACE and seizure activity, and use of other medications. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study, 20 males and 11 females. Age range was 3 months - 14.9 years. Presenting complaint was seizure in 28 patients, bite wound in 1 patient, ruptured cranial cruciate ligament in 1 patient, and hind limb paresis in 1 patient. Twenty-seven dogs did not seize after ACE administration within an average of 16.4 hours of observation (range: 0.25?66 hours). There was a known history of seizures in 22/31 prior to the day of presentation, and 15/22 were currently on maintenance anti-epileptic medication. Of the 16 not on anti-seizure medication at the time of presentation, 13 were started on phenobarbital. One was also started on potassium bromide, and 3 received no anti-seizure medication during hospitalization. All received at least one dose of ACE while in the hospital (range 1?5). Mean ACE dose was 0.029?mg/kg IV (range: 0.008?0.057?mg/kg; n=46), 0.036?mg/kg IM (range: 0.017?0.059?mg/kg; n=14), 0.53?mg/kg PO (n=2). Twenty-three received some form of anti-seizure medication in the hospital prior to being given ACE. Eight seizure episodes occurred 0.3?10 hours after ACE administration in 4. All 4 presented for seizures. The time interval between ACE administration and seizure activity was greater than that expected for measurable effects to be seen in one dog (10 hours). In conclusion, there is no clinical evidence that ACE administration at the listed dosages is associated with increased seizure activity in dogs with seizure disorders. A larger study group is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the safety of short-term ACE use in dogs with a seizure history.

AB  - Introduction: Gastric acid suppression is a recommended therapy for gastric ulceration. Human studies suggest that optimal healing of duodenal ulcers occurs at gastric pH >3 for 75% of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 gastric acid suppressants at recommended veterinary doses. Drug effect was based on the 24-hour median pH and the percentage of time that the intragastric pH ≥3 in a 24 hour period. Methods: The study was conducted in 12 healthy Beagle dogs and was a double-blind, randomized, multiple cross-over comparison of a placebo (saline IV q12?h), ranitidine 2?mg/kg IV q12?h, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q12?h, pantoprazole 1?mg/kg IV q24?h, and omeprazole (unblinded) ?1?mg/kg PO q24?h. Continuous 24-hour intragastric pH measurements were obtained via PEG tube. Prior to drug testing, 24-hour pH measurements were recorded in fasted and fed dogs. Thereafter, dogs were fed standardized meals throughout the remainder of the study period. Drugs were administered for 1 week with a one-week washout period between tests. Data were obtained on Day 0 (baseline), Day 2 and Day 6 of treatment. Following the randomized study, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q8?h and omeprazole ?1?mg/kg + bicarbonate q12?h via PEG tube were evaluated in 6 dogs, respectively. Appropriate statistical analyses were applied to calculate the 24-hour median pH and percentage of time that the test drug maintained intragastric pH≥3 over 24 hours. Results: The 24-hour median pH of fasted dogs was 4.44 vs. fed dogs 1.30 (p<0.0001). The % time pH≥3: fasted dogs 66.0% vs. fed dogs 13.3% (p<0.0001). The 24-hour median pH was (bold denotes significance when compared to saline) - saline pH 1.81, ranitidine Day 2?pH 2.53, Day 6?pH 2.05, famotidine Day 2?pH 2.83, Day 6?pH 3.68, pantoprazole Day 2?pH 3.11, Day 6?pH 3.49, omeprazole Day 2?pH 3.86, Day 6?pH 4.09. The % time pH≥3: saline 32.9%; ranitidine day 2 ? 44.6%, Day 6 ? 37.2%; famotidine: Day 2 ? 48.9%, Day 6 ? 60.1%; pantoprazole: Day 2 ? 54.2%, Day 6 ? 59.1%; omeprazole: Day 2 ? 66.9%, Day 6 ? 70.2%. The 24-hour median pH of omeprazole + bicarbonate q12?h was 4.7 on Day 2 and 4.9 on Day 6; the % time pH ≥3 was 90.9% on Day 2 and 78.4% on Day 6, respectively. No significant difference was noted in any parameter comparing famotidine q8?h and q12?h. Conclusions: Fasted dogs had a significantly higher pH than fed dogs. Omeprazole was the only drug tested that approached the potential therapeutic efficacy for healing of duodenal ulcers when assessed by criteria for human patients. Variation existed amongst dogs in all drugs tested.
