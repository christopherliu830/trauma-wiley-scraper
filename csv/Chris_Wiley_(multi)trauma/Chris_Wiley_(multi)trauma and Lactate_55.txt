AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACE) is a phenothiazine derivative used for its sedative properties. The primary mechanism of action of ACE is through inhibition of dopaminergic-2 receptors in the brain. It is a common belief that ACE lowers the seizure threshold. The purpose of this clinical study is to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of seizures in dogs presenting with a history of seizures that were treated with ACE during hospitalization. A retrospective review of records from dogs that had a chronic or acute seizure history and received ACE was done. Factors evaluated included the presenting complaint, historical seizure information, ACE dosage and route of administration, reason for giving and length of hospitalization following ACE, occurrence of seizure activity post-ACE administration, time interval between ACE and seizure activity, and use of other medications. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study, 20 males and 11 females. Age range was 3 months - 14.9 years. Presenting complaint was seizure in 28 patients, bite wound in 1 patient, ruptured cranial cruciate ligament in 1 patient, and hind limb paresis in 1 patient. Twenty-seven dogs did not seize after ACE administration within an average of 16.4 hours of observation (range: 0.25?66 hours). There was a known history of seizures in 22/31 prior to the day of presentation, and 15/22 were currently on maintenance anti-epileptic medication. Of the 16 not on anti-seizure medication at the time of presentation, 13 were started on phenobarbital. One was also started on potassium bromide, and 3 received no anti-seizure medication during hospitalization. All received at least one dose of ACE while in the hospital (range 1?5). Mean ACE dose was 0.029?mg/kg IV (range: 0.008?0.057?mg/kg; n=46), 0.036?mg/kg IM (range: 0.017?0.059?mg/kg; n=14), 0.53?mg/kg PO (n=2). Twenty-three received some form of anti-seizure medication in the hospital prior to being given ACE. Eight seizure episodes occurred 0.3?10 hours after ACE administration in 4. All 4 presented for seizures. The time interval between ACE administration and seizure activity was greater than that expected for measurable effects to be seen in one dog (10 hours). In conclusion, there is no clinical evidence that ACE administration at the listed dosages is associated with increased seizure activity in dogs with seizure disorders. A larger study group is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the safety of short-term ACE use in dogs with a seizure history.

AB  - Introduction: Gastric acid suppression is a recommended therapy for gastric ulceration. Human studies suggest that optimal healing of duodenal ulcers occurs at gastric pH >3 for 75% of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 gastric acid suppressants at recommended veterinary doses. Drug effect was based on the 24-hour median pH and the percentage of time that the intragastric pH ≥3 in a 24 hour period. Methods: The study was conducted in 12 healthy Beagle dogs and was a double-blind, randomized, multiple cross-over comparison of a placebo (saline IV q12?h), ranitidine 2?mg/kg IV q12?h, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q12?h, pantoprazole 1?mg/kg IV q24?h, and omeprazole (unblinded) ?1?mg/kg PO q24?h. Continuous 24-hour intragastric pH measurements were obtained via PEG tube. Prior to drug testing, 24-hour pH measurements were recorded in fasted and fed dogs. Thereafter, dogs were fed standardized meals throughout the remainder of the study period. Drugs were administered for 1 week with a one-week washout period between tests. Data were obtained on Day 0 (baseline), Day 2 and Day 6 of treatment. Following the randomized study, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q8?h and omeprazole ?1?mg/kg + bicarbonate q12?h via PEG tube were evaluated in 6 dogs, respectively. Appropriate statistical analyses were applied to calculate the 24-hour median pH and percentage of time that the test drug maintained intragastric pH≥3 over 24 hours. Results: The 24-hour median pH of fasted dogs was 4.44 vs. fed dogs 1.30 (p<0.0001). The % time pH≥3: fasted dogs 66.0% vs. fed dogs 13.3% (p<0.0001). The 24-hour median pH was (bold denotes significance when compared to saline) - saline pH 1.81, ranitidine Day 2?pH 2.53, Day 6?pH 2.05, famotidine Day 2?pH 2.83, Day 6?pH 3.68, pantoprazole Day 2?pH 3.11, Day 6?pH 3.49, omeprazole Day 2?pH 3.86, Day 6?pH 4.09. The % time pH≥3: saline 32.9%; ranitidine day 2 ? 44.6%, Day 6 ? 37.2%; famotidine: Day 2 ? 48.9%, Day 6 ? 60.1%; pantoprazole: Day 2 ? 54.2%, Day 6 ? 59.1%; omeprazole: Day 2 ? 66.9%, Day 6 ? 70.2%. The 24-hour median pH of omeprazole + bicarbonate q12?h was 4.7 on Day 2 and 4.9 on Day 6; the % time pH ≥3 was 90.9% on Day 2 and 78.4% on Day 6, respectively. No significant difference was noted in any parameter comparing famotidine q8?h and q12?h. Conclusions: Fasted dogs had a significantly higher pH than fed dogs. Omeprazole was the only drug tested that approached the potential therapeutic efficacy for healing of duodenal ulcers when assessed by criteria for human patients. Variation existed amongst dogs in all drugs tested.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.

AB  - Introduction: The amount of oxygen in blood is an important measure of lung function. There are three ways to quantify the amount of oxygen in blood: 1) the oxygen tension (PO2); 2) the percent of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (HbO2); and 3) the absolute content of oxygen in the blood (ContO2). PO2 is commonly measured. HbO2 and ContO2 are usually calculated from the normal human oxyhemoglobin relationship, but can be measured directly. The canine curve is similar to, but not the same as, that of humans. The purpose of this study was to compare, in dogs, direct measurements of HbO2 and ContO2 with analyzer-calculated values derived using the human oxyhemoglobin curve, and with hand-calculated values derived using a canine oxyhemoglobin curve. Materials And Methods: Arterial and jugular venous samples from 17 healthy dogs were analyzed by an ABL 705 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer, an OSM3 co-oximeter, and a LexO2con oxygen content analyzer. HbO2 was calculated from the measured PO2 using a published formula based on normal canine data (Reeves, 1982), and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. ContO2 values were calculated, and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. Means and standard deviations were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: Arterial HbO2 determined by the ABL 705 factory-programmed algorithm, reported by the OSM3 co-oximeter, and calculated from Reeves' canine formula were significantly different (97.1±0.57, 98.2±0.58, and 96.6±0.74, respectively). The calculated canine HbO2 was significantly lower than that measured by the OSM3 or calculated by the ABL for both arterial and jugular venous samples. Calculated and measured arterial and venous ContO2 were similar, as were arterial-venous ContO2 differences. However, values derived from the calculated canine HbO2 (canine-calculated) resulted in the greatest arterial-venous ContO2 difference. Conclusion: ABL-calculated and canine-calculated HbO2 were similar to measured values. Likewise, ABL-calculated, canine-calculated, and OSM3-calculated ContO2 were very similar to measured values. Although some of the values generated by the different methods are statistically significantly different, these differences are unlikely to be clinically important in the healthy dog.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.

AB  - A prospective case-control study was undertaken at DLEAH from May, 2001 to February, 2003 to examine risk factors for development of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). A questionnaire was filled out by the attending doctor for each IMHA case diagnosed. The diagnosis of IMHA was made based on a PCV <25%, effective rule out of other diseases, and the presence of at least 2 of the following: spherocytosis; regenerative response with elevated reticulocytes or polychromasia; hemolysis characterized by bilirubinuria, hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia; positive slide agglutination or positive Coombs' test. To provide case controls, the same questionnaire was filled out for the next canine patient admitted after diagnosis. Age, breed, vaccine history, previous illness, and medication history were examined. Date of admission was compared to total hospital case numbers to look for seasonality. The study contained 31 cases and 29 controls. Cases were significantly older than controls (7.45 years versus 5.1 years, p=0.01). Cocker spaniels and Cocker mixes were significantly more likely to be cases than controls (7/31 IMHA versus 1/29 controls, p=0.05). Medication and illness history for the 2 months prior to presentation was not significantly different between cases and controls. None of the IMHA cases had received antibiotics previously reported to be associated with IMHA. In contrast to previous studies, vaccination history was not significantly different between cases and controls. Five out of 31 cases had received vaccines in the previous 2 months; 4 of 9 controls had received vaccines in that same period. At least one case presented each month of the year. Although cases presented more frequently in the summer months, overall hospital case load was also elevated during these times. The monthly distributions of IMHA cases and total hospital case load were not significantly different.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the management and outcome of 10 cases of severe fulminant mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with SNP at the Animal Emergency Center between June of 1997 and August of 2000. The presence of acute respiratory distress with echocardiograph findings consistent with mitral regurgitation; no response to oxygen, lasix, and nitroglycerine ointment after 2?4 hours; and radiographic evidence that over 75% of the lung fields were involved defined dogs with severe fulminant MR. SNP was started at a dose of 1 ?g/kg/min. The dogs were monitored every 15?min by Doppler blood pressure, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, respiratory rate, and auscultation of the lungs for respiratory crackles were recorded. If the blood pressure remained above 90?mmHg systolic and increased lung sounds were present, the dose of SNP was increased by 1??g/kg/min every 15?min until respiratory crackles were reduced. These dogs were then maintained on that dose of SNP during what was called the ?maintenance period?. During this maintenance period, they were evaluated for signs of respiratory distress and blood pressure monitoring was recorded every 2 hours. The dogs were started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor during the maintenance period, and slowly tapered off the SNP. If the blood pressure decreased below 90?mmHg systolic, the dose of SNP was reduced to the previous dose. Eight dogs survived to discharge, one dog died 1 hour after starting SNP, and one dog was euthanized after 2 hours of SNP treatment. In the 8 dogs that survived, respiratory distress improved within 2 hours in 7 dogs (mean: 1.69, median: 2, range: 1.15?2) at a SNP dose of 1?3 ?g/kg/hr (mean: 1.75, median: 1.5 and range: 1?3). Respiratory distress improved in one dog within 6 hours on SNP at a dose of 5 ?g/kg/hr. In the survival group, SNP was maintained for 9?20 hours (mean: 14, median: 13 and range: 9?22). The taper of SNP occurred over 2?3 hours (mean: 4.2, median: 3 and range: 0?14) in 7 of the dogs that survived. One dog was tapered over 14 hours due to periodic episodes of hypotension and respiratory distress. The results suggest that use of SNP for treatment of dogs with CHF secondary to MR resulted in improvement in respiratory distress in 8 of the 10 dogs evaluated, and may be an effective alternative therapy for dogs with severe refractory CHF due to MR.

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively evaluate the indications, management and outcome of 152 cases of long-term positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Methods: Medical records of patients maintained on PPV for 24 hours or longer, from 1991 to 2001 were reviewed. All cases were categorized into 3 groups according to the reason they required PPV: animals with pulmonary parenchymal disease that were not adequately oxygenating (1), animals with neuromuscular or large airway disease that were not adequately ventilating (2), or animals with both inadequate oxygenation and ventilation (3). Results: A total of 152 ventilator episodes were identified represented by 124 dogs and 24 cats. The median duration of ventilation was 49 hours (range 24?356 hours). Overall, 41.4% of cases were weaned, and 27% of cases survived to discharge. There were 78 cases with inadequate oxygenation (Group 1), of which 37.2% were weaned and 20.5% survived to discharge. There were 62 cases with inadequate ventilation (Group 2), of which 50% were weaned and 38.7% survived to discharge. In Group 3, 10 cases were identified; 25% were weaned and 8.3% survived to discharge. Arterial blood gases were collected in 61.2% of cases prior to PPV. Venous blood gases were collected in 10.5% of cases and an SpO2 was recorded on 2% of cases. In 26.3% of cases, no blood gas or SpO2 measurements were performed prior to PPV. The mean PaCO2 prior to PPV was 46.9±15.5?mmHg in Group 1, 72.6±26.9?mmHg in Group 2, and 64.3±14.1?mmHg in Group 3. In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 101.7±67.6, 262.6±210.9 and 115.7±75.9, respectively. Pentobarbital, with or without diazepam, was the most common induction (28.9%) and maintenance (61.8%) agent utilized. Most cases (91.4%) were initially stabilized with volume or pressure control. Of the animals weaned from PPV, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation was used in 46% of cases and continuous positive airway pressure was used in 22.2%. Complications included pneumothorax (6.6%), oral ulceration (5.9%), and corneal ulceration (3.9%). Conclusion: Long-term PPV can be both practical and successful in veterinary medicine. Patients that require PPV due to pulmonary parenchymal disease had lower weaning and survival rates than those without.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - Although myocardial injury can be a significant component of multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in association with septicemia in critically ill human patients, it is as yet an undefined clinical entity in equine septicemia. With septicemia as the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MODS will be important in further improving survival rates. We designed a prospective study to establish normal ranges for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), T (cTnT) and CKMB mass in healthy 24?48 hour old foals, as well as septicemic neonatal foals seen over a 2-year period in a teaching hospital. We also performed a comparison of these biomarkers in surviving and non-surviving septicemic foals. Sepsis was judged on the basis of the presence of any of the 3 following criteria: blood culture positive at admission, admission sepsis score ≥11, or 3 or more sites of infection during hospitalization in foals ≤14 days of age. cTnI was measured by the ACCESS? (Beckman Coulter), cTnT was measured using the Elecsys 2010? Immunoassay (Roche), and CKMB mass measurements were performed using the Elecsys 2010?. Each parameter was described using range and 95th and 50th percentile. Comparisons were made for each parameter between normal and septic foals as well as surviving and non-surviving septic foals using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was set at p<0.05. There were 52 control foals and 38 septic foals of which 22 survived. Significant differences were documented for CKMB between septicemic and normal foals, but not for cTnT or cTnI. However, CKMB and cTnT were significantly lower in surviving versus non-surviving septicemic foals. The 50th and 95th percentiles alongside the ranges for the normal foal population were 0.14, 0.49, (0.01?0.51)??g/L for cTnI, 0.009, 0.03, (0.009?0.04)??g/L for cTnT and 2.3, 7.4, (0.4?9.3)??g/L for CKMB. Our findings suggest that myocardial injury is a component of MODS during septicemia in foals, and that quantitatively significant increases in CKMB and cTnT are seen in non-surviving septicemic foals versus survivors.
