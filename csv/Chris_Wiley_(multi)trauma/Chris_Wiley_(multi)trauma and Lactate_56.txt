AB  - While potent analgesic agents, opioids reduce intestinal transport in the intestine, thereby increasing transit times and the potential for impaction colic. Methylnaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, does not reverse the analgesic effects of morphine, and directly stimulates isolated smooth muscle strips in humans. Objective: To determine if N-methynaltrexone has an effect on contractile activity of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure. Study Design: In vitro investigation using isolated circular smooth muscle strips. Animals: 8 adult horses (n=200 muscle strips). Methods: Increasing concentrations of N-methylnaltrexone were added to tissue baths in the range of 1?10?9?M to 1?10?5?M, and contractile responses were recorded for 3 minutes. Data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with statistical significance as P<0.05. Results: The administration of N-methylnaltrexone significantly increased the contractile frequency and amplitude at all concentrations relative to baseline (P <0.0001) for the jejunum. The response was greatest at 1?10?7?M (P=0.0005) with a mean difference from baseline of 0.341?mg/cm2. The highest concentration evaluated (1?10?5?M) had a mean contractile strength of 0.206?mg/cm2 which was significantly greater than baseline activity (P=0.04). A significant increase in contractile activity for the colon was detected at 3?10?6?M (P=0.027) and 1?10?5?M (P=0.002). Clinical Relevance: Potentially, this agent could be used in conjunction with morphine to provide more potent and effective analgesia without compromising intestinal function.

AB  - Incurable ulcer in the lower legs means avascular skin defects exposing bone and osteomyelitis which cannot be repaired even with skin grafting. A total of 151 patients with incurable ulcers were operated with flaps; 60 cases of traumatized avascular defects, 20 diabetic ulcers, 17 osteomyelitis, 14 malignant tumors, 5 arterial obstructions, and 5 arteriovenous malformations, and others. A total of 61 island flaps were used; 20 posterior tibial perforator flaps, 7 saphenous flaps, 7 peroneal flaps, 4 anterior tibial flaps, 4 malleolar perforator flaps, 4 medialis pedis flaps, and others. In addition, a total of 82 free flaps using microvascualr anastomosis were sued; 24 flow-through anterior thigh flaps, 13 flow-throuh thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps (or latissimus dorsi MC flap), 8 paraumbilical (or deep inferior epigastric artery ) perforator flap, 6 saphenous venous flaps, 7 combined flaps, and 24 others. In conclusions, small ulcers could be repaired with minimal invasive methods including local perforator flaps and small muscle flaps under local anesthesia. Free flow-through flaps and free bypass flaps (for diabetic gangrene with ASO), and combined osteocutaneous flaps (for massive segmental defects after resecting advanced carcinoma) are indicated for large ischemic defects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:? It has been reported that metron factor-1 (MF-1), an engineered chimerical factor containing selected functional domains of hepatocyte growth factor and macrophage-stimulating protein (HGF?MSP), could prevent apoptosis and have an anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, we investigate the protective effect of MF-1 on liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS:? Overall 30 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the I/R model group (n?=?12), the MF-1 treatment group (n?=?12), and the sham-operated group (n?=?6). Liver I/R injury was induced by clamping the blood supply to the left and median lobes of liver by an atraumatic clamp for 90?min, then removing the clamp and allowing reperfusion. Blood samples were obtained on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 to assess liver biochemistry and the histology of liver tissue. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase were measured. In addition, the anti-oxidative effect of MF-1 on hepatocytes was assessed in vitro. RESULTS:? MF-1 treatment improved the rat survival rate significantly (P?<?0.05). Liver biochemistry and histological changes were significantly ameliorated. MDA increased and SOD and NO decreased in the liver tissue. In vitro, MF-1 protected the human hepatic cell line HL-7702 from damage of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION:? MF-1 could protect the liver from I/R injury, which might involve the reduction of oxygen free radicals and the increase of NO synthesis in an injured liver.

AB  - Abstract Pigmented orthochromatic leukodystrophy and hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids are two adult onset leukodystrophies with neuroaxonal spheroids presenting with prominent neurobehavioral, cognitive and motor symptoms. These are familial or sporadic disorders characterized by cerebral white matter degeneration including myelin and axonal loss, gliosis, macrophages and axonal spheroids. We report clinical, neuroimaging and pathological correlations of four women ages 34?50 years with adult onset leukodystrophy. Their disease course ranged from 1.5?8 years. Three patients had progressive cognitive and behavioral changes; however, one had acute onset. Neuroimaging revealed white matter abnormalities characterized by symmetric, bilateral, T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense Magnetic Resonance Imaging signal involving frontal lobe white matter in all patients. Extensive laboratory investigations were negative apart from abnormalities in some mitochondrial enzymes and immunologic parameters. Autopsies demonstrated severe leukodystrophy with myelin and axonal loss, axonal spheroids and macrophages with early and severe frontal white matter involvement. The extent and degree of changes outside the frontal lobe appeared to correlate with disease duration. The prominent neurobehavioral deficits and frontal white matter disease provide clinical-pathologic support for association pathways linking distributed neural circuits sub-serving cognition. These observations lend further support to the notion that white matter disease alone can account for dementia.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - Introduction:? Interactions between horn quality and flooring systems significantly impact on claw health. Poor horn quality is associated with reduced milk yield, painful lesions or slaughtering. Horn quality is determined by horn cells, intercellular cement and hoof horn architecture, i.e. the structure and arrangement of the horn tubules. Soft and elastic flooring systems have been reported to have a positive influence on the microstructure of hoof horn. Aims:? We wanted to correlate the microstructure of claw horn to the horn quality in a large number of samples and detect influences of the flooring system on hoof horn microstructure. Methods:? Samples were obtained from two different studies: 40 cows from Hohenheim/Germany kept on slatted floor and subsequently on rubber mats for 4 months; 1000 cows from 11 farms in Luxembourg, kept on concrete floor. From all samples 7??m-sections were cut and stained with the PAS-reaction. Morphometry was done with the LuciaG?-software (Nikon GmbH, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany) and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS? (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parameters measured were area, minimal and maximal diameter of both medulla and cortex of horn tubules. Statistical analysis included: tubules per visual field, area per visual field, total medulla area, total cortex area and the limiting values of diameters. Results:? Luxembourg samples showed consistency of tubule-parameters between both dates; all farms showed an average number ranging from 13.36 to 14.79 tubules per visual field. Hohenheim horn from the hard flooring showed 19.9 and horn of the same animals kept on rubber floor showed 20.5 tubules per visual field. Maximum diameter of hard-floor horn is 55??m whereas 45??m in animals kept on rubber floor. Conclusions:? The results show that genetic/individual differences take smaller influence on horn quality than housing systems. These outcomes provide evidence for the economical and animal welfare benefit of soft and elastic flooring systems. Further research will focus on correlation of biodata, such as physiological state, lactation, age, and claw horn microstructure. This work was supported by Biopsytec/Rheinbach.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the literature documenting the existence of bacterial translocation in humans, the effects of enteral nutrition on bacterial translocation in humans, and the hypothesis that enteral nutrition prevents bacterial translocation in humans. Data Identification: Sources included Medline search, references from review articicles, and references from animal and human studies. Study selection: The goal was to include all animal and human studies directly addressing questions of bacterial translocation and nutritional status or nutritional support. Data Extraction: An attempt was made to briefly summarize methodology and findings of relevent studies. No general attempt was made to assess quality of individual studies. Results of Data Synthesis: Bacterial translocation is a well documented phenomenon in animal models. Starvation and malnutrition of themselves do not induce bacterial translocation, but may facilitate translocation in the presence of other systemic insults. Parenteral nutrition and many forms of enteral nutrition may induce and/or facilitate bacterial translocation. Chow and certain fiber sources seem protective. Moderate direct and several lines of indirect evidence support the existence of bacterial translocation in humans. There is no direct evidence and questionable indirect evidence suggesting that enteral nutrition prevents or modifies bacterial translocation in humans. Conclusions: The hypothesis relating enteral nutrition and bacterial translocation in critically ill patients remains attractive, but unproven.
