AB  - Absolute uterine infertility affects millions of women in the United States and more throughout the world. For instance, each year in the United States about 5,000 hysterectomies are performed in women under the age of 24. In total, nearly 9 million women of reproductive age have had a hysterectomy. Based on fecundity rates, thousands of these women may be candidates for uterus transplantation. An ongoing study enrolling some of these potential recipients onto a uterus transplant ?waiting list? has revealed that most of these women have Rokitansky syndrome, hysterectomy secondary to endometriosis, cervical cancer, or compelling personal accounts justifying their candidacy. Fertility restoration by uterus transplantation was derived from fertility preservation research, including the development of the radical trachelectomy, oxygenation and perfusion of the in situ uterus, and work with organ donor networks. A decade of modern animal research set the foundation for this human work. Ongoing experiments include stable, long-term large animal allografts for investigating immunosuppression regimens and other transplantation details. Each of the animal models has contributed to the current knowledge base. Recently, nonhuman primates have been used to further investigate the possibility of human uterus transplantation. Nonhuman primate anatomy is analogous to that of humans with notable exceptions. The first human uterus transplant surgery took place in 2000, but it did not result in a pregnancy. However, taken in total, the magnitude of the intervening work from multiple groups throughout the world has made uterus transplantation a topic for discussion. It may also soon be a reality.

AB  - Key content In the UK, there are approximately 50?60 pregnancies in women with solid organ transplants each year. Kidney transplants are the most common. Adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including rates of pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery, are higher in women with solid organ transplants than in the general obstetric population. Management of the solid organ transplant recipient in pregnancy includes pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and monitoring, screening for gestational diabetes and fetal growth restriction, graft surveillance and management of immunosuppressive therapy. Multidisciplinary working is essential in the care of pregnant women with solid organ transplants. Vaginal birth is not contraindicated in women with solid organ transplants. Learning objectives To gain an overview of prepregnancy, antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care required in women with kidney transplants. To understand how the management of pregnant women with pancreas, liver and cardiothoracic transplants compares with that of renal transplant recipients. To learn about medications used in women with solid organ transplants and their safety in pregnancy and lactation. Ethical issues The absence/paucity of safety data in pregnancy for some drugs used in solid organ transplant recipients. The lack of robust data comparing solid organ transplant recipients who have undergone a pregnancy with matched nulliparous controls in determining the impact of pregnancy on long-term graft outcome.

AB  - Abstract We examined the developmental effects of early weaning on anxiety and the extinction of fear memory in male C57BL/6 mice. Early weaning led to increased freezing behaviors after fear conditioning via the foot-shock method both during extinction training and in a test of extinction recall, but did not induce significant changes in anxiety-like behavior. In addition, we found that the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein and mRNA transcripts for BDNF exon III in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at the time of extinction recall were impaired in early-weaned mice compared to normally weaned mice. In light of consistent finding that early-weaned mice experience greater stress at weaning, these data suggest that early weaning of male C57BL/6 mice is valuable for studies of the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - 1. The structural integrity of the cornea is maintained by an active fluid transport system which depends on metabolism. Experiments were designed to establish the respiratory activity of each corneal layer. 2. A rapid micropolarographic technique was used to determine the oxygen consumptions of the individual layers of the rabbit cornea. 3. Inherent problems of the determinations have been made minimal by the use of both denuded and whole corneal tissue preparations. Four independent measures were obtained for each limiting layer (epithelium and endothelium). 4. Results show that the endothelium, epithelium and stroma use 21, 40 and 39% respectively of the total oxygen consumption of the cornea. On the basis of volumes of oxygen per unit volume tissue, epithelial oxygen utilization is about ten times that of the stroma and approximately 0·2 that of the endothelium. 5. The endothelium has a larger oxygen uptake than previously reported. 6. The present results, in conjunction with other studies, indicate that the ratio of glycolytic to oxidative activity in the rabbit cornea is 0·87:0·13.

AB  - Abstract Background Incorporation of bone substitute material into the extraction socket could minimize the edentulous ridge volume loss or maximize the bone formation within the healing area. Purpose The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness in maintaining the volumetric contour of fresh extraction sockets grafted with or without 2 types of porcine biomaterials and covered with a resorbable barrier. Materials and Methods In the present multi-center single-blind randomized control trial, 55 patients underwent 1-tooth extraction, were surveyed, and randomly allocated to control- (25 sites, nat-group) or test groups (15 sites grafted with pre-hydrated collagenated cortico-cancellous porcine bone, coll-group, and 15 with cortical porcine bone, cort-group). Before extraction, and then 4 months later, contours of the sockets were acquired through a laser scanner, voxelized, and ghosts of each patient were superimposed with a matrix laboratory. Volumetric and area evaluations of the virtual superimposed models were performed with dentascan tools to create a volume of interest extending between the 2 residual teeth. Intra- and inter-group comparisons of the outcomes were performed. Non-parametric tests were applied with a level of significance set at P?<?.05. Results Intergroup analysis at 4 months' survey revealed that percentage loss of alveolar ridge volume of the coll-group (28.8%?±?8.8%) and of the cort-group (30.2%?±?7.1%) was significantly lower (P?<?.0001) than that of the naturally-healing group (46.4%?±?4.1%). No statistically-significant differences in outcomes were observed between the 2 test groups at any of the observation periods. Moreover, tooth position (bicuspids vs molars) seemed to affect neither volume loss nor basal shrinkage. Conclusion At the 4-month analysis both test groups showed reduced bone loss when compared to naturally healing sockets. However, the 2 grafting materials were not able to preserve the alveolar crest, and a reduction close to 30% in the estimates was registered after healing.

AB  - African elephants Loxodonta africana and Asian elephants Elephas maximus are not thriving in many captive settings and are threatened throughout their native ranges. Many zoos support in situ conservation projects and provide opportunities to conduct ex situ research in controlled settings with comparably approachable animals. Zoo elephant projects may facilitate fieldwork with free-ranging elephants (e.g. development of non-invasive sampling and analytical tools), which may then also improve the husbandry of elephants in human care. Free-ranging elephants also benefit from drug therapies and veterinary care when they are orphaned, kept as working elephants or brought in as rehabilitation cases ? especially as human?elephant conflicts become more common as a result of ever-expanding human populations. Much has been learned about the basic biology and husbandry needs of elephants but, often, the more we learn, the more questions arise. There are physiological differences between African and Asian elephants, and this should affect the management of these animals. This paper will provide brief overviews of the current state of knowledge regarding the pharmacology, nutrition, reproduction, sensory biology and diseases (primarily elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus infections) relevant to elephants with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Abstract Epidemiological studies associate post-menopausal estrogen use with a reduction in risk of Alzheimer's disease, a reduction in risk of Parkinson's disease, and death from stroke. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogens have been well described and may contribute to these clinical effects. Estrogen-mediated neuroprotection has been described in several neuronal culture model systems with toxicities including serum-deprivation, ?-amyloid-induced toxicity, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. In animal models, estrogens have been shown to attenuate neuronal death in rodent models of cerebral ischemia, traumatic injury, and Parkinson's disease. Although estrogens are known to exert several direct effects on neurons, the cellular mechanisms behind the neuroprotective efficacy of the steroid are only beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we summarize the data supporting a neuroprotective role for estrogens in both culture and animal models and discuss neuronal effects of estrogens that may contribute to the neuroprotective effects. These effects include activation of the nuclear estrogen receptor, altered expression of bcl-2 and related proteins, activation of the mitogen activated kinase pathway, activation of cAMP signal transduction pathways, modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, and direct antioxidant activity.

AB  - Summary This chapter examines some of the important commonalities and differences in women's lives across cultures, including physical bodies, motherhood and family, work and pay, violence, power and leadership, and feminist activism. Specific physical features linked to body dissatisfaction vary among cultures; for instance, a study of women in Thailand found that facial appearance, skin color, and skin texture all were more salient to body dissatisfaction than body weight and shape. Body dissatisfaction and body shame in women are associated with depression and low self-esteem and with suicidal ideation and intent. Body dissatisfaction also leads to actions, such as dieting, over-exercising, or choosing cosmetic surgery?that can have dire consequences for women's health. One reason women have traditionally been defined so strongly by their physical bodies is that the biological processes of reproduction?menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation?are so obvious in women.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract Conventional storage of platelet concentrates limits their shelf life to between 5 and 7 days due to the risk of bacterial proliferation and the development of the platelet storage lesion. Cold storage and cryopreservation of platelets may facilitate extension of the shelf life to weeks and years, and may also provide the benefit of being more haemostatically effective than conventionally stored platelets. Further, treatment of platelet concentrates with pathogen inactivation systems reduces bacterial contamination and provides a safeguard against the risk of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. While each of these alternative storage techniques is gaining traction individually, little work has been done to examine the effect of combining treatments in an effort to further improve product safety and minimize wastage. This review aims to discuss the benefits of alternative storage techniques and how they may be combined to alleviate the problems associated with conventional platelet storage.
