AB  - Summary The prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses distinct gender-specific challenges. Women of childbearing age are at an increased risk of VTE secondary to the transient risk factors of combined hormonal contraception (CHC) and pregnancy. Cancers specific to women are associated with a significant burden of VTE; whilst the incidence of VTE in localised breast cancer is 5 per 1000 person-years, more cases are seen due to the prevalence of breast cancer. Treatment of VTE in women can be complicated by abnormal uterine bleeding, now increasingly reported with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as well as vitamin K antagonists. Divergence between international guidelines regarding the use of CHC following an oestrogen-associated VTE and appropriate withdrawal of such contraception requires clarification for clinicians. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether to consider such events provoked or unprovoked and, consequently, the optimal duration of treatment in these women remains unclear. During pregnancy and the puerperium, the traditional anticoagulants remain the agents of choice with no further advances in DOAC safety data, and similarly in lactation. Further studies evaluating the safety and optimal treatment strategies in these women are awaited.

AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - Abstract Fas ligation via the ligand FasL activates the caspase-8/caspase-3-dependent extrinsic death pathway. In so-called type II cells, an additional mechanism involving tBid-mediated caspase-9 activation is required to efficiently trigger cell death. Other pathways linking FasL?Fas interaction to activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway remain unknown. However, ATP release and subsequent activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) favors cell death in some cells. Here, we evaluated the possibility that ATP release downstream of caspase-8 via pannexin1 hemichannels (Panx1 HCs) and subsequent activation of P2X7Rs participate in FasL-stimulated cell death. Indeed, upon FasL stimulation, ATP was released from Jurkat cells in a time- and caspase-8-dependent manner. Fas and Panx1 HCs colocalized and inhibition of the latter, but not connexin hemichannels, reduced FasL-induced ATP release. Extracellular apyrase, which hydrolyzes ATP, reduced FasL-induced death. Also, oxidized-ATP or Brilliant Blue G, two P2X7R blockers, reduced FasL-induced caspase-9 activation and cell death. These results represent the first evidence indicating that the two death receptors, Fas and P2X7R connect functionally via caspase-8 and Panx1 HC-mediated ATP release to promote caspase-9/caspase-3-dependent cell death in lymphoid cells. Thus, a hitherto unsuspected route was uncovered connecting the extrinsic to the intrinsic pathway to amplify death signals emanating from the Fas receptor in type II cells. J. Cell.

AB  - Objectives:? Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years and the need may arise to start or continue a pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In the last few years several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone. A number of studies, which examined the use of oxcarbazepine, point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Methods:? A computerized search carried out from 1980 to April 5, 2006 led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.) Results:? Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal. Conclusions:? Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms. On the other hand, classic antiepileptic drugs are well-known human teratogens, whereas data on lithium are partially ambiguous. The safety of emerging mood stabilizers in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been examined extensively. Therefore, when approaching bipolar disorder, if possible, each episode must be considered separately.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - Summary The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible injury provoked by an intensive reproductive programme based on rectal palpation in the cow. Alterations to the mesothelial surface of the peritoneum and to the oviductal mucosa were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nine multiparous Friesian cows were selected from each of two commercial dairy herds. Cows in herd 1 were maintained on a weekly reproductive health programme, while those in herd 2 were not subjected to gynaecological exploration. Surface features of the mesothelial cells of the reproductive tract and adjacent ligaments, and the oviductal mucosa were explored by SEM observation of tissue specimens from each animal. Six cows in the intensive reproductive programme showed microscopic alterations of the peritoneal surface. Strands were observed in the oviducts and adjacent ligaments in five of these cows. These strands, composed of filaments covered with mesothelial cells, were probably adhesions. Cells with abundant vacuoles on their surface were detected in the mesothelium corresponding to three animals, two of which also showed microscopic strands. No peritoneal surface alterations were observed in the cows from herd 2. No oviductal mucosal modifications were detected in either group. These findings suggest that intensive reproductive programmes based on rectal palpation may increase the risk of peritoneal surface alterations in the cow, but effects on reproductive physiology are unlikely.
