AB  - Contents The profile and function of blood and uterine leukocytes were evaluated in 14 dairy cows that spontaneously recovered from postpartum endometritis (mild, n=6 and heavy, n=8; general health not affected). From a minimum of 2 weeks before parturition until 6 weeks postpartum, blood samples were obtained twice weekly for leukocyte counts and leukogram determination and once weekly for flow cytometry assessment of polimorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) phagocytic capacity and oxidative burst activity. Uterine fluid-stained smears, obtained twice weekly from parturition until fluid was present in the uterus, were used for determination of the percentage of PMN, of phagocytizing PMN (phago-PMN) and of the mean number of phagocyted bacteria per phagocytizing PMN (phagocytic index; PI). Uterine swabs were obtained twice weekly from parturition until 35?days postpartum for bacteriological examination. The time of endometritis diagnosis was similar in cows with mild or heavy endometritis but the latter cows had a significantly longer persistence of the infection and of the isolation of Gram-negative anaerobes from the uterus. However, the effect of group (mild versus heavy) was not significant for all the blood and uterine parameters analysed. The effect of sampling day (within group effect) was significant (p<0.01 to p<0.00001) for all parameters, except for the blood monocyte count and the blood PMN phagocytic capacity, in which only a tendency for significance was observed (p<0.1). The effect of the interaction group???sampling day was significant only for the blood monocyte count. The phago-PMN and the PI were significantly correlated (r=0.70, p<0.001). A significant correlation was also observed between the uterine fluid phago-PMN and the blood PMN oxidative burst activity (r=?0.41, p<0.05). At the spontaneous recovery, the blood PMN oxidative burst activity was significantly higher (p<0.05) and the percentage of intrauterine phago-PMN and the PI were significantly lower (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) than at diagnosis of endometritis. These results suggest that a decrease in blood PMN oxidative burst activity until the first week postpartum could be associated with an increased susceptibility to early postpartum endometritis. The later increase in this parameter as well as the increase in the intrauterine fluid phago-PMN and PI, might favour the spontaneous resolution of endometritis.

AB  - SUMMARY 1 Drugs that target the central nervous system (CNS) are under-represented in the pharmacopoeia because of the difficulties of overcoming passive and active defences of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). Methods have been developed in drug discovery to make decisions about whether a compound crosses the BBB. Less is known about how the rate and extent of CNS penetration of a drug affects its clinical behaviour, largely because of past difficulties in measuring the cerebral uptake of drugs in humans. Three methods for doing so are reviewed. 2 Microdialysis is sometimes used as a clinical tool for monitoring the brain in neurointensive care and opportunistic pharmacological studies are possible. The method is relatively cheap and simple, measures free drug concentrations and is better suited to characterizing slowly changing brain drug concentrations. 3 Measuring cerebral drug uptake using positron emission tomography imaging requires the use of short-lived isotopes (labelled drug or labelled receptor ligand). Data with high spatial and temporal resolution can be collected, but the method requires expensive infrastructure. 4 Jugular bulb catheters collect pure brain venous blood and are sometimes placed for neuromonitoring. Cerebral drug uptake is inferred from the arterial to cerebral venous concentration difference. The method is relatively cheap and simple and allows global brain concentrations to be estimated. It is better suited to characterizing rapidly changing brain concentrations and effects. 5 The cerebral kinetics of a cerebro-active drug can make substantial contributions to its clinical behaviour. For example, loperamide is a peripherally acting opioid that has little CNS effect due to the active efflux transport of loperamide from the brain back into the blood by transporters including P-glycoprotein. The opioids alfentanil and fentanyl differ in their duration of action largely because of differences in their cerebral distribution volume rather than differences in systemic kinetics. The onset of anaesthesia of the intravenous anaesthetic propofol is governed almost completely by the kinetics of the first-pass passage of the drug through the brain and is more affected by changes in cerebral blood flow than hepatic clearance. 6 Continuing to exploit and develop these methods may provide new avenues to enhance the safety and efficacy of cerebro-active drugs in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Prescription opioid overdose is a leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. We aimed to identify characteristics associated with clinical severity in emergency department patients with prescription opioid overdose. Design This was a secondary data analysis of adult prescription opioid overdoses from a large prospective cohort of acute overdoses. We examined elements of a typical emergency department evaluation using a multivariable model to determine which characteristics were associated with clinical severity, specifically severe respiratory depression (SRD). Setting This study was conducted at two urban academic emergency departments in New York City, USA. Participants Adult patients who presented with acute prescription opioid overdose between 2009 and 2013 were included in the current study. We analyzed 307 patients (mean ageÂ =Â 44.7, 42% female, 2.0% mortality). Measurements Patient demographics, reported substances ingested, suspected intent for ingesting the substance, vital signs, laboratory data, treatments including antidotes and intubation and outcome of death were recorded by trained research assistants. Intent was categorized into four mutually exclusive categories: suicide, misuse, therapeutic error and undetermined. The primary outcome was SRD, defined as administration of either (a) naloxone or (b) endotracheal intubation (ETI). Findings A total of 109 patients suffered SRD with 90 patients receiving naloxone alone, nine ETI alone and 10 both naloxone and ETI. The most common opioids were oxycodone (nÂ =Â 124) and methadone (nÂ =Â 116). Mean age was higher in patients with SRD (51.1 versus 41.1, PÂ <Â 0.001). Opioid misuse was associated with SRD in the multivariable analysis [odds ratio (OR)Â =Â 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)Â =Â 1.21?3.55]. The unadjusted relative risk of SRD was high for fentanyl (83.3% SRD) and lowest for codeine (3.6% SRD). Conclusion In emergency department patients in the United States with prescription opioid overdose, worse clinical severity was associated with opioid misuse, increased with age and was widely variable, depending on the specific opioid medication involved.

AB  - Abstract Following the first successful heart transplant in 1967, more than 100Â 000 heart transplants have been carried out worldwide. These procedures have mostly relied on cold ischaemic preservation of the donor heart because this simple technique is inexpensive and relatively reliable. However, the well-known limitations of cold ischaemic preservation imposes significant logistical challenges to heart transplantation which put a ceiling on the immediate success on this life-saving therapy, and limits the number of donor hearts that can be safely transplanted annually. Although the theoretical advantages of normothermic donor heart perfusion have been recognised for over a century, the technology to transport donor hearts in this state has only been developed within the last decade. The Organ Care System (OCS) which is designed and manufactured by TransMedics Inc. is currently the only commercially available device with this capability. This article reviews the history of normothermic heart perfusion and the clinical experience with the TransMedics OCS to date. We have also attempted to speculate on the future possibilities of this innovative and exciting technology.
