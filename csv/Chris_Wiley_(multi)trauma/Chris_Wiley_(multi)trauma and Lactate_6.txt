AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com

AB  - Background A common national MTP was jointly implemented in 2011 by the national blood service (Blood Services Group) and seven participating acute hospitals to provide rapid access to transfusion support for massively haemorrhaging patients treated in all acute care hospitals. Methods Through a systematic clinical workflow, blood components are transfused in a ratio of 1:1:1 (pRBC: whole blood-derived platelets: FFP), together with cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement. The composition of components for the MTP is fixed, although operational aspects of the MTP can be adapted by individual hospitals to suit local hospital workflow. The MTP could be activated in support of any patient with critical bleeding and at risk of massive transfusion, including trauma and non-trauma general medical, surgical and obstetric patients. Results There were 434 activations of the MTP from October 2011 to October 2013. Thirty-nine per cent were for trauma patients, and 30% were for surgical patients with heavy intra-operative bleeding, with 25% and 6% for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and peri-partum haemorrhage, respectively. Several hospitals reported reduction in mean time between request and arrival of blood. Mean transfusion ratio achieved was one red cell unit: 0·8 FFP units: 0·8 whole blood-derived platelet units: 0·4 units of cryoprecipitate. Although cryoprecipitate usage more than doubled after introduction of MTP, there was no significant rise in overall red cells, platelet and FFP usage following implementation. Conclusion This successful collaboration shows that shared transfusion protocols are feasible and potentially advantageous for hospitals sharing a central blood provider.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Objectives: To review aetiology, clinical signs and outcome of cats surgically treated for septic peritonitis (2000-2007). Methods: A retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were the identification of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils and/or a positive culture from abdominal fluid and exploratory coeliotomy. Aetiology, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical parameters, surgical treatment and outcome were recorded and analysed. Results: Twenty-six cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain was reported in 10 (38 per cent) and vomiting was reported in 11 (42 per cent) of the cats. The most common aetiology was trauma (31 per cent). The principal source of contamination was the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperlactataemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia were reported in 9, 13 and 14 of the 26 cases, respectively. Non-survivors had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations than survivors (P=0·02). Nineteen cats were managed with primary closure, two with closed suction drains and three with open peritoneal drainage. Twelve (46 per cent) cats survived to discharge. Clinical Significance: In cats, lethargy, depression and anorexia were more common clinical signs than abdominal pain. Lactate level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful prognostic indicator in cats. The proportion of cats that survived was lower than previously reported and owners should be given a guarded prognosis.

AB  - Abstract The Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP) provides a variety of health and nutrition supports to vulnerable mothers and strongly promotes breastfeeding but does not have a formal framework for postnatal lactation support. Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates in Canada fall well below global recommendations, particularly among socially and economically vulnerable women. We aimed to explore CPNP participant experiences with breastfeeding and with a novel community lactation support program in Toronto, Canada that included access to certified lactation consultants and an electric breast pump, if needed. Four semistructured focus groups and 21 individual interviews (n = 46 women) were conducted between September and December 2017. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Study participants reported a strong desire to breastfeed but a lack of preparation for breastfeeding-associated challenges. Three main challenges were identified by study participants: physical (e.g., pain and low milk supply), practical (e.g., cost of breastfeeding support and maternal time pressures), and breastfeeding self-efficacy (e.g., concern about milk supply and conflicting information). Mothers reported that the free lactation support helped to address breastfeeding challenges. In their view, the key element of success with the new program was the in-home visit by the lactation consultant, who was highly skilled and provided care in a non-judgmental manner. They reported this support would have been otherwise unavailable due to cost or travel logistics. This study suggests value in exploring the addition of postnatal lactation support to the well-established national CPNP as a means to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity among vulnerable women.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the systematic ACCEPT approach enables movements of ill and injured patients between or within hospitals. Centralisation of specialist services means more transfers for clinical reasons. Many of these transfers will be time critical, some will be intensive, and some will be both. The chapter provides an overview of the patient groups that typically will need to be transferred to specialist centres, some of their characteristics and associated specific clinical management. Some of these broad categories of patients includes: neurosurgery (traumatic brain injury, cerebral bleeds), trauma, burns, vascular surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, acute limb ischaemia), interventional radiology, cardiology (primary coronary intervention), nephrology (acute renal failure), obstetric, and level 3 transfers. However, early and effective communication between centres is essential to ensure that any specific treatments are administered before or during the transfer to optimise patient care.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract There is growing evidence of the brain's ability to increase its reliance on alternative metabolic substrates under conditions of energy stress such as starvation, hypoxia and ischemia. We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate ?-hydroxybutyrate (?HB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of ?HB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-?HB 3?h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available ?HB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial ?HB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3?h of ?HB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h ?HB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham ?HB-infused animals. The TBI-induced 20% decrease in ipsilateral cortical ATP concentration was alleviated by 3?h of ?HB infusion beginning immediately after CCI injury.

AB  - Summary There are different strategies available for feeding infants in the first 4-6 months of life, and these include breastfeeding, bottle-feeding a formula and a mixed approach utilizing both breast and formula milks. This chapter reviews the processes through which human milk is produced and why breastfeeding is optimal for health and development. Human milk production is under endocrine control through actions of prolactin and oxytocin. Breastfeeding delivers immunoprotective factors to the infant, in addition to nutrients in an optimal formulation. It is associated with lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, childhood obesity and allergies in susceptible infants. The decision to use alternative feeding methods is largely shaped by social and cultural factors. Formulas designed for bottle-fed babies are generally manufactured using modified by-products of the dairy industry. Formula milks based upon sheep or goat's milk may be promoted as an alternative to cow's milk formula.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine if early enteral nutrition improves outcome for trauma patients with an open abdomen (OA). Methods: Retrospective review was used to identify 78 patients who required an OA for ≥4 hospital days, survived, and had available nutrition data. Demographic data and nutrition data comprising enteral nutrition initiation day and daily % target goal were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups: early enteral feeding (EEN), initiated ≤4 days within celiotomy; and late enteral feeding (LEN; >4 days). Outcomes included infectious complications, early closure of the abdominal cavity (<8 days from original celiotomy), and fistula formation. Results: Fifty-three of 78 (68%) patients were men, with a mean age of 35 years; 74% had blunt trauma. Forty-three of 78 (55%) patients had EEN, whereas 35 of 78 (45%) had LEN. There was no difference with respect to demographics, injury severity, or infectious complication rates. Thirty-two of 43 (74%) patients with EEN had early closure of the abdominal cavity, whereas 17 of 35 (49%) patients with late feeding had early closure (p = .02). Four of 43 (9%) patients with EEN demonstrated fistula formation, whereas 9 of 35 (26%) patients with late feeding formed fistulae (p = .05). The EEN group had lower hospital charges (p = .04) by more than $50,000. Conclusions: EEN in the OA was associated with (1) earlier primary abdominal closure, (2) lower fistula rate, (3) lower hospital charges.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of small intestine, appendix, and colorectal. Carcinoid tumors are rare gastrointestinal tumors, the majority of which are found on the appendix. These tumors may appear as a dense mass on CT imaging, resembling a fecolith, and thus are often found incidentally on pathology when the suspected diagnosis is appendicitis. Cecal volvulus occurs in younger patients who are less-debilitated than those presenting with sigmoid volvulus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is successful in over 50% of cases of sigmoid volvulus, but decompressive colonoscopy is almost never successful in cecal volvulus. Routine diversion of extraperitoneal rectal injury such as with a loop colostomy is recommended in an attempt to avoid pelvic sepsis. New techniques for using trans-anal endoscopic placement of vacuum assisted closure sponge devices have been described for management of prolonged colorectal anastomotic leaks, but not for acute rectal trauma.

AB  - Summary As compared with European practice, the American approach to resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhage de-emphasises pre-hospital interventions in favour of rapid transport to definitive care; limits initial surgical interventions under the damage control model; uses crystalloid as the initial fluid of choice; and follows an empiric 1:1:1 approach to transfusion with red cells, plasma and platelets in hemodynamically unstable and actively bleeding patients. The use of bedside visco-elastic testing to guide coagulation support is not as widespread as in Europe, while the early administration of tranexamic acid is more selective.

The Transfusion Requirements in Pediatric Intensive Care Units study randomized to either transfusion threshold 9.5?g/dL or 7?g/dL using leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC). Deaths, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), adverse events, ventilator days, and nosocomial infections were not significantly different in the two groups. When split into subgroups of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and pediatric general surgery patients, the restrictive PRBC transfusion strategy showed no increase in MODS. PRBC transfusions appear to be independently linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critically ill pediatric patients. Pediatric intensivists have recognized that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children is different from ARDS in adults. Recurrent hypotension in a pediatric trauma patient occurs late and may be an ominous sign.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Summary Bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are four substances measured in the blood for equine laboratory diagnostic purposes. Serum bilirubin quantitation is usually performed as part of a complete serum biochemical profile, while serum bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are ordered as individual tests, generally based on clinical suspicion for conditions that cause increases in blood content. For each analyte, this chapter discusses basic physiologic regulation, recommendations for sample collection and submission, and diagnostic applications and interpretation. Unique aspects of equine physiology present diagnostic challenges for the equine clinician. The also chapter addresses these challenges. Blood ammonia is most commonly measured as an indicator of liver dysfunction, typically when the animal has neurologic signs for which hepatic encephalopathy is a differential diagnosis. Horses with histopathologically confirmed liver disease and neurologic signs frequently have elevated blood ammonia, although values may transiently drop into the normal range as clinical signs wax and wane.

AB  - Massive transfusion protocols became common practice between 2006 and 2010. The terminology of ?massive transfusion protocol? was improved to ?massive haemorrhage protocol (MHP)? with the astute recognition that at the start of such a protocol, it is unclear which patients will meet the definition of massive transfusion (10 U/24 h). Despite the majority of the literature being reported from the trauma population, hospitals have generally adopted a single MHP for all patients. It remains unclear whether the same protocol can be used for all patients. MHPs assist with the prevention and management of the acute coagulopathy of trauma/shock (ACOTS). The goals of a MHP are to improve haemostasis, communication and patient outcomes. The protocol must be specific for an individual hospital, depending on factors such as prehospital transport times, distance from laboratory to trauma and operating rooms, patient populations served and types of tests available. The key components of a MHP are the 6Ts: triggering of the protocol, laboratory testing, tranexamic acid, temperature maintenance, transfusion support and termination of the protocol when haemostasis is achieved. The evidence and importance of each of these steps will be discussed in detail. It is also critical that a quality assurance programme supports the MHP. Poor compliance with the institutional MHP is associated with inferior survival. Each MHP activation should be followed by a formal debrief by the team. Audits should be performed to determine compliance and to inform annual update of the MHP. Formal training and/or simulation should be a core part of the policy.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.
