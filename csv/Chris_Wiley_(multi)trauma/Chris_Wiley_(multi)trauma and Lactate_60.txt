AB  - Although the enteral route of enteral feeding is the preferred method of nutrition support for critically ill patients, this important therapeutic strategy is not without risk. In human subjects, the digestion and absorption of nutrients induce typical hemodynamic changes, consisting of an increase in mesenteric blood flow at the expense of reduced systemic blood pressure. On rare occasion when providing aggressive enteral nutrition to critically ill patients, common symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerance may progress to a syndrome of abdominal distention, hypotension, and shock, with the development of small bowel ischemia or necrosis. Although the incidence of small bowel ischemia secondary to enteral feeding is low, the overall clinical outcome is still poor and carries a high mortality rate. Enteral feeding is well tolerated and is probably beneficial in most critically ill patients before and after a period of hypotension. Although enteral nutrition may be used with caution during the period of hypotension, evidence of poor gastrointestinal function (increased nasogastric tube output, unexplained abdominal pain, and abdominal distention), or development of dilated loops of bowel or intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis) on radiographic studies should be interpreted as potential indicators of gut ischemia. With progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention of ischemic injury to the intestinal mucosa, the strategy of aggressive enteral feeding for critically ill patients may result in a reduction in this major complication and enhanced functional recovery from severe illness.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - Abstract Fatal ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and starvation may produce characteristic basal vacuolization of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC). Septic ketoacidosis has recently been recognized clinically as a distinct condition in which septicemia can lead to elevation of ketones and various anions unrelated to diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or caloric deprivation. We report four lethal cases with significantly elevated vitreous ketones secondary to sepsis and/or severe localized infection in individuals with no history of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or starvation. Three of four cases exhibited typical basal vacuolization of RTEC. We suggest that septic ketoacidosis is an appropriate cause of death in the forensic setting where sepsis or severe localized infection is found with significant ketoacidosis (?-hydroxybutyrate > 5 mmol/L)?in the absence of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, starvation, or other states associated with accelerated ketogenesis. The finding of basal vacuolization of RTEC in such cases provides morphological support for the underlying metabolic derangement.

AB  - Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that activated microglia contribute to the neuropathology involved in many neurodegenerative diseases and after traumatic injury to the CNS. The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-?1), a potent deactivator of microglia, should have the potential to reduce microglial-mediated neurodegeneration. It is therefore perplexing that high levels of TGF-?1 are found in conditions where microglia are chronically activated. We hypothesized that TGF-?1 signaling is suppressed in activated microglia. We therefore activated primary rat microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and determined the expression of proteins important to TGF-?1 signaling. We found that LPS treatment decreased the expression of the TGF-? receptors, T?R1 and T?R2, and reduced protein levels of Smad2, a key mediator of TGF-? signaling. LPS treatment also antagonized the ability of TGF-? to suppress expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to induce microglial cell death. LPS treatment similarly inhibited the ability of the TGF-? related cytokine, Activin-A, to down-regulate expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to induce microglial cell death. Together, these data suggest that microglial activators may oppose the actions of TGF-?1, ensuring continued microglial activation and survival that eventually may contribute to the neurodegeneration prevalent in chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. We propose that LPS/TLR4 signaling interferes with key components in the TGF-?1 signaling pathway in primary microglia. As a result, the ability of TGF- ?1 to exert anti-inflammatory effects is significantly reduced leading to prolonged survival of classically activated microglia. Identifying the mechanisms by which TGF- ?1 signaling is targeted during microglia activation may yield novel strategies for deactivating chronically activated microglia.

AB  - Abstract Microfabrication and nanotechnology have significantly expanded the technological capabilities for monitoring and modulating neural activity with the goal of studying the nervous system and managing neurological disorders. This feature article initially provides a tutorial-like review of the prominent technologies for enabling this two-way communication with the nervous system via electrical, chemical, and optical means. Following this overview, the article discusses emerging high-throughput methods for identifying device attributes that enhance the functionality of interfaces. The discussion then extends into opportunities and challenges in integrating different device functions within a small footprint with the goal of closed-loop control of neural activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and reduced adverse tissue response. The article concludes with an outline of future directions in the development and applications of multifunctional neural interfaces.
