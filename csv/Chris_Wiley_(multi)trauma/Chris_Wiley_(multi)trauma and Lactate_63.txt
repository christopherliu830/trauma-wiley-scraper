AB  - Abstract Subgaleal haemorrhage (SGH) is an important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the neonate. Its increased prevalence in recent years has coincided with the rise in the number of births assisted by vacuum extraction. Three deaths in Australia within the last 7 years have been the subject of two coronial inquests. Subsequent coronial reports have highlighted that neonatal death from SGH can be prevented if appropriate attention is paid to identification of risk factors, early diagnosis, close observation and aggressive treatment. To prevent unnecessary deaths, all involved in the care of the baby after birth need to be aware of the importance of prompt diagnosis, monitoring and early treatment of SGH.

AB  - Abstract Oxygen is frequently administered to patients with suspected stroke. However, the role of oxygen therapy in ischemic stroke remains controversial in light of the failure of three clinical trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to show efficacy, and the fear of exacerbating oxygen free radical injury. The previous trials had several shortcomings, perhaps because they were designed on basis of anecdotal case reports and little preclinical data. Most animal studies concerning oxygen therapy in stroke have been conducted over the last 6 years. Emerging data suggests that hyperbaric and even normobaric oxygen therapy can be effective if used appropriately, and raises the tantalizing possibility that hyperoxia can be used to extend the narrow therapeutic time window for stroke thrombolysis. This article reviews the history, rationale, mechanisms of action and adverse effects of hyperoxia, the key results of previous hyperoxia studies, and the potential role of oxygen therapy in contemporary stroke treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY Animal reproductive biotechnology is continually evolving. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of early embryonic mortality and embryo development in domestic animals, which has improved the selection and success of in vitro technologies. Yet our knowledge is still relatively limited such that identifying a single embryo with the highest chance of survival and development for transfer remains challenging. While invasive methods such as embryo biopsy can provide useful information regarding the genetic status of the embryos, morphological assessment remains the most common evaluation. A recent shift, however, favors alternative, adjunct approaches for non-invasive assessment of an embryo's viability and developmental potential. Various analytical techniques have facilitated the evaluation of cellular health through the metabolome, the assessment of end products of cellular metabolism, or by analyzing spent media for small RNAs. This review discusses the application of noninvasive approaches for ascertaining the health and viability of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. A comparative analysis of noninvasive techniques for embryo assessment currently being investigated in cattle and humans is also discussed. Mol. Reprod.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Effective carrier technologies and dosing appear critical for the successful use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This study evaluated radiographically the potential of a purpose-designed titanium porous-oxide implant surface combined with recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) to stimulate alveolar ridge augmentation. Material and methods: Twelve young-adult Labrador dogs were used. Three 10-mm titanium implants per jaw quadrant were placed 5?mm into the alveolar ridge following extraction of the premolar teeth and reduction of alveolar ridge. Six animals received implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 0.75 or 1.5?mg/ml randomized to contralateral jaw quadrants. Another six animals received implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 3?mg/ml or uncoated control using the same split-mouth design. The mucoperiosteal flaps were advanced, adapted, and sutured to submerge the implants. Radiographic registrations were made immediately postsurgery (baseline), and at weeks 4 and 8 (end of study). Results: rhBMP-2-coated implants exhibited robust radiographic bone formation extending to and above the implant platform from week 4 (P<0.01). Some rhBMP-2-coated implants showed voids within the newly formed bone that gradually resolved and/or implant displacement, being severe in two animals receiving implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 3?mg/ml. Controls showed limited, if any, new bone formation at weeks 4 and 8 postsurgery. There were no significant differences among the rhBMP-2 groups in bone gain. Conclusions: The titanium porous-oxide surface serves as an effective carrier for rhBMP-2, showing a clinically significant potential to stimulate local bone formation. With the carrier technology used, therapeutic dosage appears to be in the range of 0.75?1.5?mg/ml.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.
