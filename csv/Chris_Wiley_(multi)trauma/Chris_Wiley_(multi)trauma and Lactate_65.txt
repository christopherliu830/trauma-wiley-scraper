AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the comparison of magnetic resonance (MR) spectra acquired from unknown brain lesions with published spectra in order to help identify unknown lesions in clinical settings. The paper includes lists of references for published MR spectra of various brain diseases, including pyogenic abscesses, encephalitis (herpes simplex, Rasmussen's and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), neurocysticercosis, tuberculoma, cysts (arachnoid, epidermoid and hydatid), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), Alexander disease, Canavan's disease, Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy), Leigh's disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with cysts, metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Pelizaeus?Merzbacher disease, Zellweger syndrome, HIV-associated lesions [cryptococcus, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)], hydrocephalus and tuberous sclerosis. Each list includes information on the echo time(s) (TE) of the published spectra, whether a control spectrum is shown, whether the corresponding image and voxel position are shown and the patient ages if known. The references are listed in the approximate order of usefulness, based on spectral quality, number of spectra, range of echo times and whether the voxel positions are shown. Spectra of Zellweger syndrome, cryptococcal infection, toxoplasmosis and lymphoma are included, along with a spectrum showing propanediol (propylene glycol). Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Recent advancements in bioanalytical techniques have led to the development of novel and robust diagnostic approaches that hold promise for providing optimal patient treatment, guiding prevention programs and widening the scope of personalized medicine. However, these advanced diagnostic techniques are still complex, expensive and limited to centralized healthcare facilities or research laboratories. This significantly hinders the use of evidence-based diagnostics for resource-limited settings and the primary care, thus creating a gap between healthcare providers and patients, leaving these populations without access to precision and quality medicine. Smartphone-based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging this gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability, cost-effectiveness and connectivity. Moreover, towards simplifying and automating bioanalytical techniques, biosensors and lab-on-a-chip technologies have become essential to interface and integrate these assays, bringing together the high precision and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques with the connectivity and computational power of smartphones. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of clinical smartphone diagnostics and its contributing technologies, as well as their wide range of areas of application, which span from haematology to digital pathology and rapid infectious disease diagnostics.

AB  - Abstract The role of donor, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors in predicting patient survival after liver transplantation was evaluated by the Bio Medicus data package on a database containing 162 variables filled with records from 100 consecutive first-liver transplant cases. Donor data did not predict outcome. Recipient preoperative data (Child status, HCV status) were predictive using life table and Cox regression methods. Recipient intraoperative data (by-pass time, warm ischemia time, delay in arterial revascularization, and packed red blood cell requirements) were predictive of outcome using life table analysis. Recipient postoperative data (rejection, sepsis, primary dysfunction, and hepatic artery thrombosis) were predictive of outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the clinical course of a dog presented with peliosis hepatis and hemoperitoneum in concert with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Case summary: A 7.75-year-old spayed female Shetland Sheepdog presented with clinical signs consistent with hypovolemia, hemoperitoneum, and a history of bright green stool 3 days before the onset of clinical signs. Initial packed cell volume/total solids were consistent with acute hemorrhage. A coagulation profile showed prolongation in activated clotting time and prolongation of both prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting abnormal coagulation. Abdominal hemorrhage persisted in the face of normalization of the hemodynamic status and coagulation profile, and treatment with Vitamin K1. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple patchy hypoechoic areas throughout the caudate liver lobe. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 24 hours after presentation and revealed the caudate liver lobe as the source of the hemorrhage. Histopathologic examination of a specimen of the liver was consistent with peliosis hepatis. Toxicologic testing identified diphacinone levels in the blood consistent with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and within 48 hours the dog was discharged. The dog returned to full function and a hepatic ultrasound performed 15 months postoperatively showed no significant abnormalities. New or unique information provided: Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides may be associated with the development of peliosis hepatis in dogs.
