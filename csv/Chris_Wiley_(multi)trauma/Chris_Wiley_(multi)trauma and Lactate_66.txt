AB  - SUMMARY ?First, do no harm. ?These words have been the doctrine of medicine since its inception. The era of evidence-based medicine now compels us to provide scientific evidence that we indeed do no harm and that the treatments we prescribe have a beneficial effect. The colloid/crystalloid debate continues to evolve and is as hotly contested now as it was a decade ago. There may be some international differences in the use of colloids or crystalloids, but most of us continue to use both. Whatever our preferred choice of intravenous fluid for the treatment of hypovolemia, clinical outcome studies suggest that ?when?? and ?how much?? are probably more important questions than ?what??. There are now a wide variety of fluids available to the clinician and most differ markedly in their composition. Aside from the gross classification of IV fluids into colloids and crystalloids, they may be subclassified into balanced or unbalanced categories, i.e., those that contain concentrations of electrolytes similar to those in the plasma and those that do not (see Table 1).The very fact that ?normal? saline is unphysiological was recognized many years ago. This fact led Alexis Hartmann to develop Hartmann's solution in an attempt to produce an isotonic alkalizing solution. He recognized the need for proportionately more sodium than chloride1, which led to a solution very similar to Ringer's original2. The existence of hyperchloremic acidosis has been recognized in many areas for some time, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and ammonium chloride poisoning, and is generally termed a low-anion gap acidosis. There is now mounting evidence that the administration of intravenous saline and saline-based fluids is the commonest avoidable cause of clinically relevant hyperchloremic acidosis.

AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010; 32: 628?636 Summary Background? The importance of adequate nutritional support in selected patient groups is well established. Traditionally, the amounts of macronutrients provided have been based on a perceived need to achieve, if not exceed, energy and protein balance. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the concept of ?permissive underfeeding?. Aim? To determine whether or not there is evidence of benefit for permissive underfeeding in selected groups. Methods? Studies were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed databases and the Cochrane collaboration. The search was limited from January 1950 to January 2010. Further searches were made from the references of original articles. The literature search revealed 591 abstracts of relevant studies. All abstracts were initially reviewed by the primary author (AO) and those that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were discarded. The remaining articles were requested and were reviewed independently by two authors (AO, JM). Results? Twelve studies were included in the final analysis. Eight of these were randomized interventional trials. Three were prospective cohort studies and one was a retrospective analysis. Conclusion? This review suggests that permissive underfeeding may be associated with improved outcomes and reduced morbidity in patients requiring short-term nutritional support.

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.
