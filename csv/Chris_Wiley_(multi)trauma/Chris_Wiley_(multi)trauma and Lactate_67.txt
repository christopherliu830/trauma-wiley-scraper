AB  - Summary This chapter discusses some miscellaneous arrhythmias and cardiac conditions in canine and feline patients. The conditions dealt with in the chapter include arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, junctional escape beats, bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (sick sinus syndrome), electrical alternans (pericardial effusion), left bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block, ST segment abnormalities, and T-wave abnormalities. Additionally, canine congestive heart failure (mitral valve insufficiency), canine dilated cardiomyopathy, feline aortic thromboembolism (saddle thrombus), feline congestive heart failure, heartworm (caval syndrome (CS)), and pericardial effusion are also discussed. For each condition, recognition, differentials and diagnostics, treatment and prognosis are explained. Some artificats and anomalies are discussed initially. All animals should be placed in right lateral recumbency for consistency. The lead placement need to be verified whenever an arrhythmia is detected. Machine standardization has to be checked, as this can result in complexes of too large or too small size.

AB  - Abstract Background Previous studies document the therapeutic potential of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) carrier for indications in the axial and appendicular skeleton. Nevertheless, the ACS does not comprise structural integrity to adequately support bone formation for onlay indications. The objective of this study was to evaluate local bone formation and osseointegration following surgical implantation of rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto a compression resistant matrix (CRM). Methods Routine, contralateral, critical-size, supraalveolar, peri-implant defects in five adult male Hound Labrador mongrel dogs received 0.8 mg rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto either the ACS (benchmark control) or a CRM (collagen/?-TCP/hydroxyapatite) followed by submerged wound closure for primary intention healing. The animals were euthanized at 8 weeks for histologic/histometric evaluation. Results Healing was uneventful albeit considerable initial swelling was observed for either treatment. Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed significantly increased bone area (20.0 ± 0.9 versus 12.3 ± 2.6 mm2, p = 0.03) and bone density (24.1 ± 1.4% versus 14.6 ± 2.0%, p = 0.04) compared with those receiving rhBMP-2/ACS. There were no significant differences between treatments for new bone height and osseointegration. Woven and lamellar trabecular bone lined with abundant osteoid was observed for all sites. Inconsistent cortex formation confirmed the immature nature of the newly formed bone. Seroma formation was observed for both treatments (80?100% of the animals/implants). Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed residual ceramic granules undergoing biodegradation, including accumulation of foamy macrophages. Conclusions rhBMP-2/CRM supports bone formation of clinically relevant geometry. Longer observation intervals as well as dose variations appear necessary to capture maturation of the newly formed bone, elimination of residual ceramic granules and resolution of seroma formation(s).

AB  - Abstract Oxidative stress, resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species, plays a critical role in astroglial cell death occurring in diverse neuropathological conditions. Numerous studies indicate that neuroglobin (Ngb) promotes neuron survival, but nothing is known regarding the action of Ngb in astroglial cell survival. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential glioprotective effect of Ngb on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured mouse astrocytes. Incubation of cells with subnanomolar concentrations of Ngb (10?14?10?10 M) was found to prevent both H2O2-evoked reduction in surviving cells number and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ngb treatment abolishes H2O2-induced increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Concomitantly, Ngb treatment rescues H2O2-associated reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases and catalase) and prevents the stimulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin (IL) IL-6 and IL-33). Moreover, Ngb blocks the stimulation of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and the inhibition of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) gene expression induced by H2O2, which in turn abolishes caspase 3 activation. The protective effect of Ngb upon H2O2 induced activation of caspase 3 activity and cell death can be accounted for by activation of protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase transduction cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that Ngb increases Akt phosphorylation and prevents H2O2-provoked inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that Ngb is a glioprotective agent that prevents H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic astroglial cell death. Protection of astrocytes from oxidative insult may thus contribute to the neuroprotective effect of Ngb.

AB  - Abstract Objective Extracorporeal life support is increasingly used in the treatment of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Identifying therapeutic targets and factors associated with the prognosis are highly desirable. The present study analysed the impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on the outcome of patients undergoing VA ECMO. Methods Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels of 329 patients were analysed prior to, on day 1 and 5 of VA ECMO therapy. IL 6 and 8 serum levels of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared. At time points with significant differences, receiver operating characteristics and cut-off levels were analysed to determine the prognostic value of interleukin serum levels. Survival analysis was performed to compare patients above and below cut-off levels. Results Interleukin 6 serum levels were significantly elevated in non-surviving patients prior to VA ECMO initiation. Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels in non-surviving patients were significantly elevated on day 1 of VA ECMO. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed significant prognostic impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on day 1 of VA ECMO (AUC 0.70 and 0.72). Survival analysis comparing patients above and below cut-off showed a 1 year survival of 32.6% for IL6 and 20.8% for IL8 above, as well as 66.9% for IL6 and 61.9% for IL8 below the cut-off (p<0.05). Conclusion Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels demonstrated prognostic value early in VA ECMO therapy. The technical applicability of interleukin reduction raises interest in interleukin 6 and 8 as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary Septic shock is characterized by an inability of the host to maintain vascular integrity and fluid homeostasis, resulting in inadequate tissue oxygenation and circulatory failure. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) describes a generalized inflammatory response of the host to a variety of insults. SIRS is considered a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. Disruption of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is a well-recognized component of septic shock. The clinical spectrum of sepsis depends primarily on the host response to infection rather than the severity of the infection itself. The pregnant host may be different from the traditional septic shock host in ways other than the difference in microbiologic pathogens involved. Physiologic adaptations to pregnancy designed to promote favorable maternal and fetal outcome occur in almost every organ system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 50 percent of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - Summary Most wild rodents that are brought to veterinary clinics by either the public or a licensed rehabilitator are the common species in the local area. Many rodents live near humans so people often notice them and often want to help them. In many cases, the wild rodent is fine and would not benefit from human intervention. It may require knowledge of the species' natural history and time to assess the situation and advise on next steps. After the initial quarantine period has passed and the rodent appears healthy, some rodent species (e.g., fox squirrels, and eastern gray squirrels) may be placed with others of the same species, age, size, and developmental stage in order to minimize stress and facilitate socialization. The chapter tabulates natural and captive diets for several rodent species. Diseases in wild rodents vary greatly with species and geographic region. Familiarity with local wildlife diseases is important when diagnosing and treating native rodents.
