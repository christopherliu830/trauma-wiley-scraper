AB  - Abstract Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug often used to treat multiple myeloma, can cause hypo- or hyperthyroidism. We present a patient being treated with lenalidomide for 2 years who developed severe hypothyroidism that was complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Thyroid function tests should be serially monitored in patients taking lenalidomide.

AB  - Abstract Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a clinical syndrome associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. In approximately 80% of patients, the syndrome is associated with the A3243G mutation. However, it has been realized that the A3243G mutation is not uncommon in the general population and is found in many patients with clinical presentations other than MELAS. We present four patients who presented with rhabdomyolysis, muscle fatigue, external ophthalmoplegia and myoclonic jerks respectively. These patients were all found to have the A3243G mutation on muscle biopsy. These patients illustrate the variety of presentations associated with A3243G mutation.

AB  - Summary The primary goal of regionalized perinatal care is for women and neonates at high risk to receive care in facilities that provide the required level of specialized care. This chapter reviews the increasing need for and rationale, logistics, and components of a successful transport program. Many fields of medicine have recognized the importance of regionalizing medical care to achieve better clinical outcomes by healthcare facilities with predefined designated levels of care. There are three types of perinatal patient transport: maternal-fetal or maternal transport. neonatal transport, and return transport. The chapter focuses primarily on maternal-fetal transport. Maternal transport is the process of transport of a pregnant woman during the antepartum or intrapartum period for special care of the woman, the fetus/neonate, or both. Logistical considerations in maternal-fetal transport include mode of transport, personnel, equipment, supplies, and fetal monitoring. The chapter discusses condition-specific considerations, such as preterm labor, hemorrhage, preeclampsia, and sepsis, for common transport indications.

AB  - Wearable or attachable health monitoring smart systems are considered to be the next generation of personal portable devices for remote medicine practices. Smart flexible sensing electronics are components crucial in endowing health monitoring systems with the capability of real-time tracking of physiological signals. These signals are closely associated with body conditions, such as heart rate, wrist pulse, body temperature, blood/intraocular pressure and blood/sweat bio-information. Monitoring such physiological signals provides a convenient and non-invasive way for disease diagnoses and health assessments. This Review summarizes the recent progress of flexible sensing electronics for their use in wearable/attachable health monitoring systems. Meanwhile, we present an overview of different materials and configurations for flexible sensors, including piezo-resistive, piezo-electrical, capacitive, and field effect transistor based devices, and analyze the working principles in monitoring physiological signals. In addition, the future perspectives of wearable healthcare systems and the technical demands on their commercialization are briefly discussed.

AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Summary Changes in physiological parameters that are induced by acute exercise on a treadmill in healthy military dogs have not been thoroughly investigated, especially with regard to age. This study investigated the effects of acute exercise on a treadmill on cardiovascular function, biochemical parameters and gastric antral motility in military dogs. Thermography was used to assess variations in superficial hindlimb muscle temperature. Nine healthy dogs were distributed into three groups according to their age (Group I: 25 ± 7 months; Group II: 51 ± 12 months; Group III: 95 ± 10 months) and sequentially subjected to running exercise on a treadmill for 12 min (3.2 km/h at 0° incline for 4 min, 6.4 km/h at 0° incline for 4 min and 6.4 km/h at 10° incline for 4 min). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), gastric motility, haematocrit and biochemical analyses were performed at rest and after each session of treadmill exercise. Infrared thermographic images of muscles in the pelvic member were taken. Exercise decreased DAP in Group I, increased systolic arterial pressure in Groups II and III and increased mean arterial pressure in Group III (all p < 0.05). After the exercise protocol, plasma creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels increased only in Group I (p < 0.05). Exercise increased heart rate and decreased the gastric motility of a solid meal at 180 min in all groups (all p < 0.05). Exercise also elevated temperature in the femoral biceps muscles in Group I compared with the older dogs. The results indicate that acute exercise decreased gastric motility in dogs, regardless of age, and caused more pronounced cardiovascular changes in older dogs than in younger dogs. Acute exercise also altered biochemical parameters and superficial hindlimb muscle temperature in younger military dogs.
