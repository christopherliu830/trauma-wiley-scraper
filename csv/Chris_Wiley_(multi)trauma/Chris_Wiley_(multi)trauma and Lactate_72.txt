AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - ABSTRACT Purpose: The aims of this prospective study were to assess the treatment outcome of immediately loaded full-arch fixed bridges anchored to both tilted and axially placed implants for the rehabilitation of the mandible and to compare the outcome of axial versus tilted implants. Materials and Methods: Sixty-two patients (34 women and 28 men) were included in the study. Each patient received a full-arch fixed bridge supported by two axial implants and two distal tilted implants (All-on-Four?, Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden). Loading was applied within 48 hours of surgery. Patients were scheduled for follow-up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually up to 5 years. At each follow-up, plaque level and bleeding scores were assessed; moreover, patient's satisfaction for aesthetics and function was evaluated by a questionnaire. Radiographic evaluation of marginal bone level change was performed at 1 year. Results: The overall follow-up range was 6 to 43 months (mean 22.4 months). Forty-four patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year. No implant failures were recorded to date, leading to a cumulative implant survival and prosthesis success rate of 100%. Plaque level and bleeding scores showed progressive decrease over time, parallel to increase of satisfaction for both aesthetics and function. No significant difference in marginal bone loss was found between tilted and axial implants at 1-year evaluation. Conclusion: The present preliminary data suggest that immediate loading associated with tilted implants could be considered a viable treatment modality for the mandible.

AB  - Cell swelling activates or upregulates a number of anion channels. Of the volume-activated or -regulated anion channels (VAACs or VRACs), the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOR) is most prominently activated and ubiquitously expressed. This channel is known to be involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell volume regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and cell migration as well as cell turnover involving apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that VSOR activity is also involved in a number of pathophysiological processes including the acquisition of cisplatin resistance by cancer cells, ischaemia?reperfusion-induced death of cardiomyocytes and hippocampal neurons, glial necrosis under lactacidosis as well as neuronal necrosis under excitotoxicity. Moreover, VSOR serves as the pathway for glutamate release from astrocytes under ischaemic conditions and when stimulated by bradykinin, an initial mediator of inflammation. So far, many signalling molecules including the EGF receptor, PI3K, Src, PLC? and Rho/Rho kinase have been implicated in the regulation of VSOR activity. However, our pharmacological studies suggest that these signals are not essential components of the swelling-induced VSOR activation mechanism even though some of these signals may play permissive or modulatory roles. Molecular identification of VSOR is required to address the question of how cells sense volume expansion and activate VSOR.

AB  - SUMMARy Increasing evidence indicates that patients known to have cardiovascular risk factors who are anemic should be managed differently from patients not known to be at risk. Clinical studies of patients in critical care units, patients in cardiac care units with acute myocardial infarction, and in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing surgical procedures have demonstrated that patients at risk suffer adverse clinical consequences with moderate to severe anemia. Studies in a number of clinical settings indicate that morbidity and mortality can be improved with aggressive management of anemia.

AB  - Abstract The AGRI committee of the European Parliament requested EFSA to assess the welfare of rabbits farmed in different production systems, including organic production, and to update its 2005 scientific opinion about the health and welfare of rabbits kept for meat production. Considering reproducing does, kits and growing rabbits, this scientific opinion focusses on six different housing systems, namely conventional cages, structurally enriched cages, elevated pens, floor pens, outdoor/partially outdoor systems and organic systems. To compare the level of welfare in the different housing systems and rabbit categories, welfare impact scores for 20 welfare consequences identified from the literature were calculated, taking their occurrence, duration and severity into account. Based on the overall welfare impact score (sum of scores for the single welfare consequences), obtained via a 2-step expert knowledge elicitation process, the welfare of reproducing does is likely (certainty 66?90%) to be lower in conventional cages compared to the five other housing systems. In addition, it is likely to extremely likely (certainty 66?99%) that the welfare of kits is lower in outdoor systems compared to the other systems and that the welfare is higher in elevated pens than in the other systems. Finally, it is likely to extremely likely (certainty 66?99%) that the welfare of growing rabbits is lower in conventional cages compared to the other systems and that the welfare is higher in elevated pens than in the other systems. Ranking of the welfare consequences allowed an analysis of the main welfare consequences within each system and rabbit category. It was concluded that for reproducing does, as well as growing rabbits, welfare consequences related to behavioural restrictions were more prominent in conventional cages, elevated pens and enriched cages, whereas those related to health problems were more important in floor pens, outdoor and organic systems. Housing in organic rabbit farming is diverse, which can result in different welfare consequences, but the overall welfare impact scores suggest that welfare in organic systems is generally good.
