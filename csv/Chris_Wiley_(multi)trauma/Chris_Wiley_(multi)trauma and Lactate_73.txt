AB  - Abstract The AGRI committee of the European Parliament requested EFSA to assess the welfare of rabbits farmed in different production systems, including organic production, and to update its 2005 scientific opinion about the health and welfare of rabbits kept for meat production. Considering reproducing does, kits and growing rabbits, this scientific opinion focusses on six different housing systems, namely conventional cages, structurally enriched cages, elevated pens, floor pens, outdoor/partially outdoor systems and organic systems. To compare the level of welfare in the different housing systems and rabbit categories, welfare impact scores for 20 welfare consequences identified from the literature were calculated, taking their occurrence, duration and severity into account. Based on the overall welfare impact score (sum of scores for the single welfare consequences), obtained via a 2-step expert knowledge elicitation process, the welfare of reproducing does is likely (certainty 66?90%) to be lower in conventional cages compared to the five other housing systems. In addition, it is likely to extremely likely (certainty 66?99%) that the welfare of kits is lower in outdoor systems compared to the other systems and that the welfare is higher in elevated pens than in the other systems. Finally, it is likely to extremely likely (certainty 66?99%) that the welfare of growing rabbits is lower in conventional cages compared to the other systems and that the welfare is higher in elevated pens than in the other systems. Ranking of the welfare consequences allowed an analysis of the main welfare consequences within each system and rabbit category. It was concluded that for reproducing does, as well as growing rabbits, welfare consequences related to behavioural restrictions were more prominent in conventional cages, elevated pens and enriched cages, whereas those related to health problems were more important in floor pens, outdoor and organic systems. Housing in organic rabbit farming is diverse, which can result in different welfare consequences, but the overall welfare impact scores suggest that welfare in organic systems is generally good.

AB  - Summary Dogs and cats, like all other mammals, have a variety of bacteria that normally inhabit their skin surface. This chapter discusses bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcal bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the Staphylococcus species found on the dog. Staphylococcus schlieferi and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause canine and feline pyodermas. The chapter then provides a discussion on clinical features, diagnostic tests, and treatment for surface pyodermas, superficial pyodermas, and deep pyodermas. It is important that clients understand the secondary nature of bacterial skin infections. Patients with recurrent or chronic skin infections who have received multiple courses of antibiotics are at increased risk for methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. Diagnosis and control of the underlying disease are essential in the management and prevention of these bacterial infections. Most clients want to be actively involved in their pet's treatment, and the veterinary staff must listen to and address their concerns as early as possible.

AB  - Abstract NMR spectroscopy of biofluids provides a wealth of information on the endogenous metabolic processes in an organism. Details of the various types of biofluid and the types of NMR experiment which are useful are given. The features of biofluid NMR spectra are described and practical details of spectral acquisition are also presented. However, the spectra are very complex and many resonances have not been assigned. Therefore, in order to focus on significant differences between a set of spectra from control organisms and from abnormals (e.g., humans with diseases or animals in toxic situations), recourse is made to pattern recognition or chemometric methods. This is exemplifed using NMR spectra of a number of different biofluids such as urine, blood plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. This approach is encapsulated in the concept of metabonomics, a subject which can be regarded as complementary to studies of the genome (genomics) and the proteins in an organism (proteomics). Metabonomics is defined as ?the quantitative measurement of the multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification.??? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.?Concepts Magn Reson 12: 289?320, 2000

AB  - There is increasing uncertainty over the potential benefits and harms of volume expansion in paediatric and adult critical care settings. In addition, there are increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects and association with RBC transfusions in neonates, including transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis. Preterm infants <28 weeks? gestation in particular are likely more vulnerable to volume shifts and changes in blood pressure due to their unique physiology. This review paper will provide an overview of the current evidence base supporting the use of RBC transfusion thresholds and the use of fluid bolus therapy in neonates. We will argue that enhanced data collection and collaborations through neonatal networks, development of international consensus definitions of transfusion adverse effects and associations, as well as haemodynamic compromise in neonates, are needed to further advance research in these areas.

AB  - Abstract The majority of oral surgery patients do not require the input of a critical care department (CCD). However, oral surgeons working in secondary care may be involved in the management of such patients. This may be due to surgical complications or sequelae (predicted or otherwise) or for medical reasons. Oral Surgery trainees working within Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments are likely to be involved in managing patients whose presenting condition necessitates care within a CCD. This article gives an overview of the reasons for use of a CCD and some of its functions.
