AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on flexible sensors for personal health-monitoring systems that can detect human activity and physiological vital signs. It discusses the recent work on flexible health-monitoring devices based on organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials whose structural modification and sensing mechanism depend on the method of signal transduction. The chapter also discusses noninvasive or minimally invasive design approaches to highly flexible, wearable, and body-attachable healthcare devices for different body sites in terms of enhanced functionalities that can detect and distinguish multiple bio-signals with high sensitivity. The state-of-the-art technology in multifunctional flexible sensors has the advantages of high accessibility and usability for consumers, as well as allowing more reliable self-diagnoses of diseases via complementary analysis of multiple bio-signals. The chapter considers the practical application for flexible healthcare sensors and suggests possible future health-monitoring systems. Flexible temperature sensors for wearable and body-attachable applications are widely studied in terms of thermistors, thermocouples, the thermoelectric effect, and optical approaches.

AB  - Abstract The Scientific Opinion on the welfare of animals during transport reviewed the most recent scientific information concerning the main farm species. New scientific evidence and consequent conclusions and recommendations were arranged following the structure of Annex I of EC Regulation 1/2005 . On fitness for transport, recommendations for cattle and poultry were focused on repeated humane handling and careful inspection prior to transport. On the means of transport, use of partitions in horse transport, compulsory fasting of pigs with provision of water at stops, and temperature limits for poultry were major recommendations. Maintaining stability of animal groups was recommended as good practice, with special emphasis on the need to avoid mixing unfamiliar pigs or goats. On watering and feeding intervals, journey times and resting periods, journey duration should not exceed 12 hours for horses and 29 hours for cattle. Horses should be supplied with water one hour before and one hour after transport, and for cattle there should be a 24 hour recovery period with access to food and water. For rabbits, time spent inside the containers during lairage should be considered journey time. Space allowance for horses should be given in terms of kg/m2 instead of m2/animal. For cattle and sheep, it is recommended that space allowances should be calculated according to an allometric equation relating size to body weight. Limits for stocking densities of broilers in containers should be related to thermal conditions. On the navigation systems, temperature monitoring systems should be incorporated. Minimum standards should be established regarding data type to be recorded, the system and the on-board architecture. Recommendations for further research focused on the thermal limits and regulation for poultry and rabbits, the effects of ventilation on pigs, space allowance for rabbits, newly hatched chicks and pigs, optimal journey times for horses, pigs and calves.

AB  - Summary As the incidence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase in the United Kingdom, more diabetic patients will present for both elective and emergency surgery. Whilst the underlying pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differs, there is much good evidence that controlling the blood glucose to >?10?mmol.l?1 in the peri-operative period for both types of diabetic patients improves outcome. This should be achieved with a glucose?insulin?potassium regimen in all type 1 diabetics and in type 2 diabetics undergoing moderate or major surgical procedures. After surgery, a decrease in the catabolic hormone response resulting from good analgesia and the avoidance of nausea and vomiting should allow early re-establishment of normal glycaemic control.

AB  - Abstract Clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) mainly concerns itself with the quantification of metabolite concentrations. Metabolite relaxation values, which reflect the microscopic state of specific cellular and sub-cellular environments, could potentially hold additional valuable information, but are rarely acquired within clinical scan times. By varying the flip angle, repetition time and echo time in a preset way (termed a schedule), and matching the resulting signals to a pre-generated dictionary ? an approach dubbed magnetic resonance fingerprinting ? it is possible to encode the spins' relaxation times into the acquired signal, simultaneously quantifying multiple tissue parameters for each metabolite. Herein, we optimized the schedule to minimize the averaged root mean square error (RMSE) across all estimated parameters: concentrations, longitudinal and transverse relaxation time, and transmitter inhomogeneity. The optimal schedules were validated in phantoms and, subsequently, in a cohort of healthy volunteers, in a 4.5 mL parietal white matter single voxel and an acquisition time under 5 minutes. The average intra-subject, inter-scan coefficients of variation (CVs) for metabolite concentrations, T1 and T2 relaxation times were found to be 3.4%, 4.6% and 4.7% in-vivo, respectively, averaged over all major singlets. Coupled metabolites were quantified using the short echo time schedule entries and spectral fitting, and reliable estimates of glutamate+glutamine, glutathione and myo-inositol were obtained.

AB  - Background: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±), interleukin (iL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Like IL-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Secondly, it was investigated whether serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is an acute-phase protein in man such as C-reactive protein (CRP), with which it is physically and structurally related. Methods: Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either low-dose opioid anaesthesia consisting of thoracic epidural analgesia combined with inhalational anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (REI). Results: Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. The cytokine levels returned to preoperative levels 1?3 d after operation. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses. Conclusion: CABG performed during two different anaesthetic techniques, high-dose fentanyl versus low-dose opioid anaesthesia, elicited a well-defined cytokine response with minor variation in the time course of each cytokine. The cytokine production was not modified by type of anaesthesia. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men.
