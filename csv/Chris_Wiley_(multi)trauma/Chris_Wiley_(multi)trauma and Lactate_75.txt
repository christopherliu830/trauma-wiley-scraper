AB  - ?Hurricane Katrina ? Unorganized, unprepared and internationally embarrassed? Despite well defined, pre-exisiting organizational plans and national response strategies, Hurricane Katrina exposed major weaknesses in the ability of a region or nation to respond to a tragedy of significant magnitude. Significant lessons were learned from the event. Must have in place: ?? A national and regional disaster response plan ?? A ?Chain of Command / Responsibility? Doctrine ?? A national and regional disaster response system ?? National, regional and local ?Incident Command? structures ?? Emergency supply stockpiles ?? Pre-established communication frequencies Major considerations: ?? Make this a military function ? make all civilian agencies report to them ?? Military has the comm, logistics, command structure, personnel and the training to take on this mission. ?? Train for an event at regional and national levels ?? Cross train all responders ?? Eliminate the red tape at the front end of the event ?? Mobilize and ?do it?

AB  - The single vehicle rollover accident is a highly complex crash mode and there is growing concerns about its incidents and consequences in central Australia. The aim of this paper is to assess: 1 The incidence and injury patterns of rollover accidents 2 Pre rollover characteristics on rollover propensity 3 The injury severity and outcome of rollover accidents The absence of speed limit, unfenced roads, vast distances traveled, unsealed roads and high use of alcohol makes the spectrum of MVA? s in NT unique. In this two year period of study from Jan 2004 ? Dec 2005, there were 470 motor vehicle accidents of which 126 were single vehicle rollover accidents. 132 patients were admitted; 73 NT residents of which 45 were of aboriginal origin and 14 were international tourists. There were 37 deaths in Central Australian roads and 20 were due to single vehicle rollover accidents. None of the deaths occurred at the Alice Springs hospital . Most rollover accidents occur at a speed above 100?km/h. 24 patients had an ISS?>?15 and 35% of all injuries were to head, neck and shoulder. Rollovers occurred when the vehicle left the road way and encountered a tripping mechanism such as soft dirt or loose gravel. Those who were belted fared better than those unbelted occupants. Completely ejected occupants were all unbelted. Mean time to hospital from time of accident was 8Hrs. Primary prevention strategies need to involve remote communities, tourists traveling in central Australia and address alcohol and restraint use.

AB  - Objective? Playground and sporting accidents account for a large percentage of paediatric injuries, yet they are largely preventable. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors and mechanisms associated with upper and lower limb fractures in children. Method? 145 children admitted to a regional Australian hospital (Coffs Harbour Base Hospital) totalling 207 upper and lower limb fractures over an 12 month period between January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2004 were identified from the hospital medical records database. Retrospective analysis was performed on demographic data, fracture type and mechanisms causing the fracture. Results? Males accounted for 69.7% of all childhood limb fractures. 77.7% of all fractures were upper limb, while 22.3% were lower limb. The leading causes of lower limb fractures were football injuries, push bike accidents, and aquatic accidents, accounting for 51.8% of all lower limb fractures. Monkey bars, swings, trees, skateboard and scooter accidents were associated with a relatively high prevalence of upper limb injuries when compared to other injury mechanisms. Football, push bike and skateboard accidents alone accounted for 40.6% of fractures in our male patients. This figure was only 4.5% in our female patients, and in general, the causes of fractures in females are more evenly distributed. Conclusion? Limb fractures in children have a diverse range of causes, but specific fractures occur more frequently in particular sexes and with certain activities. There is a role for further injury prevention targeting specific high risk groups and activities.

AB  - The clinical trigger to consider the presence of a coagulopathy is the onset of non-surgically controllable bleeding. While earlier consensus documents considered this event predictable by modelling blood loss, and factor level decline, we now recognize confounding variables such as shock, hypothermia, metabolic disturbances and fibrinolysis confuse the picture to such an extent traditional treatment algorithms are irrelevant. The monitoring of coagulopathy by traditional coagulation screens also lacks validation, and is usually so delayed in response time to become irrelevant to appropriate management. Attaining euvolaemia is possible with large volume dedicated infusion systems but in a patient with massive mediator release and comorbidities may not achieve adequate tissue oxygen delivery. Evidence based transfusion triggers are still lacking. Management of coagulopathy is by component replacement early. Delays occur because of slow coagulation test turnaround times, and the place of newer point of care monitors and thrombelastography needs evaluation. Delay in delivery of blood components due to processing time may worsen the outcome. Factor VIIa probably has a unique place in the management of coagulopathy in these patients, but studies are needed to define dosage and time of dose (2). The management of acidosis and hyperlactaemia are fundamentally improved by better perfusion, but short term correction may be indicated to reinforce coagulation factor function.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion in surgery has long been understood to carry a fair amount of clinical risk despite its obvious benefits. For this reason, blood loss conservation and other methods for minimization of transfusion have become of paramount importance for the advancement of ongoing safe care of the surgical patient. This chapter will serve as an overall guide to understanding the availability, cost, and usage of blood products in surgery. Additionally, we will discuss techniques used during procedures that play a role in minimization of transfusion. Further, the potential benefits of unnecessary blood transfusion in surgical patients will be explained with a goal of improving outcomes in the future.

AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in intestinal healing in intra-abdominal infection. Currently, the effect of localized intra-abdominal infection on anastomotic healing and strength is not known. This study was designed to evaluate anastomotic wound healing in the presence of intra-abdominal abscess. 30 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 270?300 grams were used for this experiment. 20 animals underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with 16 gauge needle. They were followed for 14 days. 9 of them died in the first week. The CLP animals had an initial 20% weight loss; however by day 10 they had a gradual return toward control weight. At the end of 14 days, rats from CLP group (n?=?11) and control group (n?=?10) underwent laparotomy and single-layer left colonic anastomosis. Blood cultures and abdominal swab cultures were sent from both groups. Post-operatively, animals were allowed to recover, food and water were offered ad libitum. At post-operative day five, animals were euthanized by thiopental overdose. Following anastomotic bursting pressure measurements, two samples were taken from the anastomotic line for subsequent determination of hydroxyproline content. Groups were compared with Students?t test. Data were expressed as means?±?SEM. In the post-operative period, all rats lost 10% to 12% of their body weight. No bacterial growth was detected in cultures. Hydroxyproline content measurements were significantly higher in the CLP group (11.2?±?0.3 vs. 9.8?±?0.5?ug HPO/mg dry tissue weight. P?<?0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in bursting pressure measurements between the groups (177?±?6.3 vs. 164?±?10.4?mmHg. P?>?0.05). These findings suggest that localized intra-abdominal infection without sepsis doesn?t inhibit intestinal anastomotic healing.
