AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), immunosuppression and sepsis for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system and enhance adaptive immunity. We have examined the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1?-(IL-1?), gamma-interferon (IFN?) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNFα) on human ?-defensin-2 (HBD-2) levels in cultured keratinocytes. We have also examined the effects of heat shock at 42?°C. Our results demonstrate that only TNFα shows significant induction of HBD-2 but this induction was not sustained in the long term. In addition, endogenous levels of defensin were significantly reduced by exposure to heat shock. The keratinocytes also responded to IL-1? by becoming hypertrophic. These results indicate that stress-related, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce keratinocytes to synthesize HBD-2, while heat shock appears to reduce its production. Understanding the roles cytokines play in the continued problems associated with severe wounding, and in particular, major burn injury, is important. This study provides further insight into the role of natural anti-microbial peptides under conditions of stress.

AB  - Keloids are scars that overgrow the original boundaries of the injury, involving aberrant functioning of the fibroblasts. We have found that during normal wound healing the ELR-negative CXC chemokines IP-9 (CXCL11) and IP-10 (CXCL10) act to limit fibroblast immigration. Our initial goal was to determine if keloid fibroblasts failed to respond to this ?stop? signal. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical studies on keloid fibroblasts show that these lesions express excessive amounts of IP-9 and CXCR3 receptor. The protein levels of CXCR3 receptor was also not dissimilar between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Though, the expression of the protein and the receptor seems to be normal, the fibroblasts derived from these abnormal lesions did not respond to IP-9 during EGF induced cell migration. We have extended these findings to determine whether other genes are differentially expressed by keloid fibroblasts. The immediate first gene that interest us was the mRNA levels of CXCR3 receptor (GPR9) wherein, we did not find any significant difference between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Further, we also found interestingly, that genes related to tumor progression are up regulated in keloid fibroblasts than the normal fibroblasts. The marker genes like calgranulin, BCL-2 associated anthogen 4 (BAG4), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Certain transcription factors like GATA-6 and SpiB are also increased. Apart, the classical growth factor and growth factor receptor related genes which includes, bone morphogenetic protein BMP-1, heparin binding EGF like growth factor, EGF like repeats discoidin1, IGFBP-5 and 3, EphB1&B2, tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, serine threonine kinase 6 along with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan brevican and versican and vitronectin are also up regulated. The newl identified genes will open new avenues in targeting keloid lesions by understanding the basic signaling mechanism of these specific proteins.

AB  - Calreticulin (CRT) is a major classic Ca-binding chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, CRT has been recognized to have widespread extracellular effects as well. In the current study we show that CRT increases both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of porcine and murine wound repair. Partial thickness wounds were created on the paravertebral area of pigs (n?=?4) and 0.1% and 0.5% CRT, and PDGF (positive control) applied for 4 consecutive days. In wounds harvested at 5 days, CRT induced a 28 and 22% greater extent of reepithelialization than PDGF and Tris/Ca buffer control, respectively (% healed?=?56/CRT; 40.5/PDGF; 44/control). In addition, CRT stimulated earlier granulation tissue formation in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative dermal depth, microns: 1615/CRT; 1250/PDGF; 1325/control). A similar granulation tissue inducing effect of CRT was also observed in a steroid-impaired pig model. As a diabetic model of wound repair, two 5?mm circular full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db mice; the wounds were splinted open with silicone rings and covered with occlusive dressing (n?=?24). After 5 days of treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 5% CRT, a dose-dependent 8-, 4.5-, and 2-fold increase in granulation tissue formation was observed (p?<?0.05). However, there was no apparent effect on wound closure. Tissue sections showed a highly cellular dermis in the CRT treated wounds. In addition, CRT (50?pg/ml) stimulated wound closure in a scratch plate assay using fibroblasts by 45%, in 48?hrs, compared to 2% for the control. Therefore, CRT may be a novel agent for wound healing by acting as a chemoattractant for cells involved in wound remodeling and in epithelial migration. Suppported by Calretex, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: We hypothesize that interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) blockade with IL-6r antibody will increase matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) production in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, MMP-3 protein levels were measured in fibroblasts cultured from normal skin and hypertrophic scar with and without IL-6 receptor blockade. Methods: Primary cell cultures of normal skin (NSF) and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HTS) were obtained from the same patient (n?=?5) and seeded into 6 well plates (40,000?cells/cm2) in complete media. Cells were treated with and without IL-6 receptor antibody and IgG (10?ng/ml) for 6 hours. Protein concentrations of MMP-3 are determined in equal volume of supernatants by ELISA. Statistical analysis was by unpaired t-test(*P?<?0.05). Results: Blocking IL-6 receptors with its antibody showed significant increase in MMP-3 protein concentration in HTS compared to NSF. MMP-3(ng/ml) MMP-3(ng/ml) NSF 1.6?±?0.13 HTS 0.7?±?0.37 NSF?+?IL-6r 0.3?±?0.15 HTS?+?IL-6r 2.3?±?0.5* NSF?+?IgG 0.26?±?0.16 HTS?+?IgG 0.75?±?0.14 Conclusion: IL-6 receptor mediated signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar formation and its blockade may reduce hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Biocompatible matrices, such as bovine collagen, have demonstrated usefulness in delivering gene therapy vectors that express growth factors to local environments for tissue repair. Unlike animal derived matrices, we have developed a new synthetic matrix consisting of a linear cyclodextrin-polyethyleneglycol co-polymer that is non-covalently cross-linked with di-adamantane-polyethyleneglycol via inclusion complex formation between adamantane and cyclodextrin (CD-Ada). We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments for biocompatibility and localized transgene expression using a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector containing either the reporter gene, GFP, or the therapeutic gene, PDGF-B. In vitro results demonstrated cell migration, adenoviral transduction, and gene expression with no visible signs of toxicity in human skin fibroblasts. Qualitative gene expression from the CD-Ada containing rAd was delayed by approximately two days when compared to collagen, but the level of expression was greater over a longer period of time. In vivo experiments demonstrated gene expression after local delivery to mouse skin using rAd-GFP in CD-Ada. Again, the expression was slightly delayed but duration of expression was comparable to collagen. Expression studies using rAd-PDGF-B, were performed in the rat polyvinyl alcohol sponge model and showed comparable quantitative DNA and RNA levels between CD-Ada and collagen (DNA: 4.1???1010 and 4.5???1010 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively; RNA: 7.0???108 and 3.2???108 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively). Additionally, we explored the use of plasmid DNA with the CD-Ada matrix and observed PDGF-B expression in vivo. Our results show that this new delivery system provides a safe, efficient, and adaptable medium for both viral and non-viral gene delivery.

AB  - Fibrin Sealant products such as TisseelR have been used over the last 25 years to reach hemostasis during surgery or to seal tissues. Moreover, there were many studies on the use of fibrin sealant in cell and bioactive substance delivery. Our In Vitro and In Vivo studies, over the last 2 years, have focused on the use of fibrin sealant to deliver human fibroblasts or keratinocytes to overcome the healing deficiency in chronic wounds. We have shown that some fibrin formulations supported a high fibroblast proliferation and other fibrin formulations supported a high proliferation of human keratinocytes. In this study, we examined the use of fibrin sealant in the co-delivery of both human ? derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study report examined the cell proliferation of these two cell types in various formulations of fibrin sealant. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mixed with various dilutions of the Sealer Protein solution and added to culture plates before adding the Thrombin solution to form fibrin clots containing both cell types. We found that a low to medium sealer protein concentration (1?34?mG/mL) and a very low thrombin concentration (1?U/mL) in the final fibrin clots provided for an optimal cell proliferation for both cell types within these fibrin clots. This profile of proliferation was different from that seen when keratinocytes alone or fibroblasts alone were incorporated in the fibrin clots. Morphologically, it was difficult to determine the cell type from examining cell morphology, thus, it was difficult to determine the cell distribution. In conclusion, we found that various modified formulations of fibrin sealant may be chosen when co- delivering fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, there seems to be a positive feedback between keratinocytes and fibroblasts when they were co ? introduced in the fibrin clots. This feedback could be carried by growth factors. Future studies will determine his signaling process.

AB  - Composition and structure determine the fate of biomaterials in the body, encouraging or discouraging acceptance, cellular infiltration, and degradation or incorporation into host tissue. Most biomaterials research has been focused on composition, while structure remains a relatively uninvestigated factor in biomaterial success. Naturally derived biomaterials may provide optimal structure for cellular repopulation in certain applications. Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix used in the clinical treatment of soft tissue injury, including pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. SIS consists primarily of collagen, although the presence of other proteins, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans has been reported. SEM was used to characterize the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Cryo-SEM was used to image mechanically isolated, oxidatively disinfected, lyophilized, sterilized, and rehydrated SIS. The fractured cross-sectional faces of intact intestine, oxidatively disinfected SIS, and lyophilized SIS were imaged with traditional SEM. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that SIS is a heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. There are differences in the structure of the mucosal and serosal surfaces. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse and delamination following lyophilization, much of the native structure is preserved. These changes are preserved following rehydration. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture-clearly facilitates host interaction on thecellular and subcellular levels.

AB  - Although electrical stimulation (ES) has been successful in the treatment of various types of wounds, the popularity of the treatment has waned due to a lack of optimal methods of administration. The goal of this study has been to develop and evaluate a method of delivering ES that is easy to use and suitable for delivery in a home-health environment.[0] Specifically, a novel bandage system developed to provide an electric field in a manner resembling the natural wound current was tested in vivo. In this study, a full-thickness wound model in New Zealand white rabbits was used to measure the effects of such a bandage system on healing of [0]skin defects. Different levels of current were evaluated initially, with 50 and 20??A selected for the focus of this study, along with a non-stimulated control. Using histomorphometry healing rates, cellularity, and blood vessels were quantified at one and two week time points. The study showed the ability of this ES bandage to speed the healing process. An increase in overall healing rate over non-stimulated wounds of 45%(p?=?0.04) was observed in wounds stimulated with 50??A of current for 1 week. In wounds treated for 2 weeks, contraction rate decreased as well as the ratio of contraction rate to epithelialization rate. The stimulated wounds also showed an increase in the amount of macrophages, with a 79% increase in number of macrophages in wounds stimulated with 20??A for 2 weeks and a 198% increase in macrophages in those stimulated with 50??A compared to non-stimulated wounds. The performance of the bandage in the animal model has led to a limited clinical study on pressure ulcer patients using the 50??A system.

AB  - Identifying molecular loci of impaired cutaneous healing in diabetes with an eye towards developing targeted therapy to ameliorate dysrepair continues to evolve as a promising area of study. By using an excisional wound model produced on the dorsum of female diabetic C57BL/KsJ db?+?/db+ mice as well as their normal (WT)  2)Adnull vector; 3)PBS. Postoperatively, wounds were examined & photographed on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 & 28. Also, tissue was harvested for histology & immunohistochemistry (PECAM), and snap frozen for protein & RNA analysis. A scoring system was used to grade re-epithelialization, granulation tissue thickness, matrix density, inflammation, vascular density, epithelial maturity. AAV-VEGF exerted minimal effect on repair in WT and HZ mice. However, pronounced neovascularization, thickened granulation tissue & increased matrix deposition was noted after VEGF treatment in the db/db mice compared to those that received PBS or adnull vector at all timepoints. While the induction of angiogenesis in VEGF treated db/db mice lagged behind the unimpaired mice by 5?7 days, a global improvement in wound healng was observed.

AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine constitutively expressed in adipose tissue and upregulated by hypoxia in sites of tissue injury and in the placenta. Leptin has been demonstrated to play a role in normal and pathological wound healing and it is gene is acutely expressed in experimental wounds. Angiogenesis is among the most salient and well-documented biological actions of leptin. Therefore it was hypothesized that leptin may play in the modulation of wound neovascularization. Using a murine model of experimental wounds the modulation of wound angiogenesis was investigated by treatment of the wounds to either recombinant leptin or a neutralizing anti-leptin antibody. The parameters measured were: a)woundblood flow using laser Doppler imaging; b)vesseldensity by counting the number of CD-31 positive vessels in wound sections; c)angiogenic transcriptionalprofiling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR; and d)validation of transcriptionalprofiling by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The treatment of wounds with leptin had a marked effect in wound blood flow that was most significant at 24hours post-wounding with average increase of 55% with respect to the controls. The effect diminished significantly by 72 hours (24%) and became negligible thereafter. Leptin also accelerate wound neovascularization by 24 hours where the number of small caliber vessels averaged 30/mm2 in leptin treated vessels and 13/mm2 in the controls (n?=?10; P?<?0.005). However, the number of vessels measured by 72 hours not significantly different between controls and leptin-treated wounds. In addition transcriptional profiling reveled changes in gene expression of molecules related to angiogenesis such as VEGF, PlGF, Tie-1, Tie-2, Flt-1, Flk-1, FGF-2 and endothelial markers like CD-31, endoglin and eNOS. Overall, time course analysis throughout the healing process showed that leptin treatment induced an early shift in the expression of many of the analyzed transcripts. The most salient changes could be observed as early as 6 hours post-wounding and included: TSP-1 (+8.7); FLK-1(+9); Ang-2 (+18); CD31(+5.3); endoglin (+7.6); eNOS (+4.2); FGF-2 (+4.3); etc. Leptin mRNA was also significantly increased (+10) as well as the long-form of its receptor ObR-b (+9). Conversely, when wounds were exposed to anti-leptin antibodies, healing progression was impaired and changes in the transcriptional profile showed diminished expression of several genes related to wound neovascularization. Some examples by 24 hours: Endoglin(?2.5); Flk-1(?2.8); eNOS (?5.1); Ang-2 (?5.1); CD31(?3); VEGF-A (?3.6). In conclusion, leptin had and early and significant effect in modulating wound neovascularization. The effect of treatment of wounds with exogenous leptin did not elicit hypervascularization of the wound and appeared to only accelerate what appeared to be a self-limited process of wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: One of the earliest events in wound healing and scar formation is the inflammatory phase. Deficient or excessive inflammatory responses result in aberrant healing. NFK-b is a transcription factor that regulates key genes responsible for multiple intra-nuclear inflammatory cytokines. When bound to IK-B, an inhibitory protein, this factor is in an inactive state. We studied the wound healing effects of irreversibly inhibiting the activation of NFK-b by continuously infusing adenoviral activated IK-B. Methods: Seventy-five male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponge-osmotic pump constructs. The pumps were filled with a solution containing a genetically altered adenovirus containing the DNA for continuously activated IK-B protein. 50??l of viral transport media containing 5???109 PFU of virus were delivered to each individual sponges daily. Controls included pumps filled with normal saline in one group or filled with sham virus in another group. Sponges were harvested on days 1,3,5, and 7 post-implantation. The sponges were analyzed for TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as index of inflammation, as well as for hydroxyproline (OHP) content at seven days, an index of collagen deposition. Results: Treatment with the IK-B virus resulted in significantly higher levels of OHP after seven days when compared to normal saline and sham virus treated sponges (654?±?81 vs 546?±?109 vs 498?±?123??g OHP/100?mg sponge, P?<?0.05 by ANOVA). Wound fluid NO concentration was significantly lower in the IkB group after 5 days (38?±?15 vs 55?±?12 vs 71?±?27??M, P?<?0.05 by chi-square). There were no differences in sponge TNF-α concentrations on days 1,3, and 5. Conclusions: Treatment of wound sponge granulomas with IK-B increases the amount of collagen deposition after seven days. Reduction of inflammation by inhibiting NF-KB may be a possible mechanism of action, as reflected in decreased NO wound content.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Background: The study of wound biology and effects of advanced modalities would benefit from a reliable human model for normal healing. Eaglstein et?al. previously suggested that the forearm biopsy may be useful in acute wound healing studies (J Am Acad Dermatol 45:857, 2001). The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) here validates this model in healthy individuals treated with topical growth factor therapy. Methods: In our randomized, double-blinded study design, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel (Q.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.O.D.), iii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). The wounds were examined, measured and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events were monitored. Rates of healing and time-to-complete closure were measured. Repeat biopsies of a subset of healing wounds were performed for gene microarray analysis. Results: The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of acute wound healing outcomes achieved by rhPDGF-BB regimens versus standard care alone. There were no infectious complications. Subject compliance was excellent with?<?3% of visits missed. Conclusion: The forearm biopsy model has several advantages in the study of acute wounds: it allows for comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion; studies can be conducted easily with good patient compliance; and the forearm allows for repeat imaging and tissue harvesting for gene profiling during healing.

AB  - The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in wound healing is well established. These interactions likely involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-ß family. TGF-ß1, ß2 and ß3 isoforms signal by sequentially binding to the TGF-ß type II and type I receptors, respectively. We address the role of TGF-ß signaling in dermal fibroblasts using a conditional fibroblastic TGF-ß type II receptor knockout mouse model (termed FßKO). We found that the loss of TGF-ß signaling in the dermal fibroblasts results in accelerated excision-wound closure compared with similar wounds in wild type mice. The mechanism of the altered rate of re-epitheliaization in the FßKO mice was examined with regard to keratiocyte motility and proliferation. The migration of keratinocytes through collagen I coated 8??m pore filters in the presence or absence of fibroblast-conditioned media was tested. These experiments showed increased keratinocyte migration when incubated with FßKO dermal fibroblast conditioned media compared to media conditioned in wild type fibroblasts. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded intact skin indicated both wild type and FßKO mice had similar low levels of keratinocyte proliferation, based on Ki67 staining. In healing wounds, only the distal wound edges of wild type mice were proliferative. In contrast, the FßKO mice exhibited elevated proliferation across the length of the wound, including the leading edge of epithelial closure. Together our results suggest TGF-ß signaling by the dermal fibroblasts suppresses re-epithelialization of excision wounds by regulating keratinocyte motility and proliferation through paracrine mechanisms. ?
