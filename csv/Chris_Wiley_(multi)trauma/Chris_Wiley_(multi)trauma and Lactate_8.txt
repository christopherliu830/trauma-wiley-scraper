AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - The case study uses secondary information to examine the financial crisis that morphed into public health emergency in Flint, Michigan. While previous crisis management studies have examined financial crises and public health emergencies, the present study embodies both of them and offers an opportunity to understand how multi-level governments cooperate in responding to multiple emergencies. The overarching question of interest is how do local governments cooperate with multi-level governments to respond to multiple local emergencies? The specific research questions are as follows: (i) What are the causes, consequences, cautions, and coping strategies of the Flint crises; (ii) What are the roles of multi-level governments in responding to the Flint crises? and (iii) What are the indicators of success and failure in the response by multi-level governments to the Flint crises? The paper draws on the American federalism and crisis management scholarship for context and finds that crisis management leadership, effective communication, subsidiarity principles as in multi-level response, and accountability are necessary for effective response efforts that build resilient organizations. The findings corroborate previous studies making the present study generalizable to other emergencies. Local governments can learn from the Flint experience in mitigating the impact of crises.

AB  - Abstract Glucose is a principal metabolic fuel in the central nervous system, but, when glucose is unavailable, the brain can utilize alternative metabolic substrates such as monocarboxylates to sustain brain functions. This study examined whether the replacement of glucose with monocarboxylates (particularly pyruvate and lactate) had an equivalent effect of glucose on neuronal survival in rat hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, or ameliorate the neurotoxicity induced by amyloid ?-peptide (A?). The possible mechanism was also explored. We found that pyruvate and lactate alone increased cell death in the hippocampal slice cultures at 24 and 48?h. Supplementation of glucose-containing culture media and A?-treated culture media with pyruvate, but not lactate, attenuated cell death as strong as with trolox, known as a reactive oxygen species scavenger, and niacinamide, an NAD+ precursor, and this protective effect was reversed by α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Pyruvate significantly increased the aconitase activity and the NAD+ levels in the hippocampal slices in the presence of A?, but did not maintain the ATP levels. Our results indicate that pyruvate and lactate alone cannot replace glucose as an alternative energy source to preserve the neuronal viability in the hippocampal slice cultures. Pyruvate, in the presence of glucose, improves neuronal survival in the hippocampal slice cultures and also protects neurons against A?-induced cell death in which mitochondrial NAD(P) redox status may play a central role.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. It is essential for a practitioner to understand oxygen delivery and how it can be optimized when providing adequate hemodynamic support in the critically ill patient. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume. Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly and shallow. Multiple factors can affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry monitors. CO-oximetry is a four wavelength non-invasive monitoring system that allows additional measurements of blood constituents. It not only measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as pulse oximetry does, but also dyshemoglobins. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can help identify problems immediately after intubation and before critical hypoxemia becomes manifest. Adding lactate determinations to oxygen transport monitoring provides a more complete assessment of tissue oxygenation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Quantum dots (QDs) are novel tools with multiple biological and medical applications because of their superior photoemission and photostability characteristics. However, leaching of toxic metals from QDs is of great concern. Therefore, for the successful application of QDs in bioscience, it is essential to understand their biological fate and toxicity. We investigated toxicological effects and tissue distribution of mercaptopropionic acid-conjugated cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS-MPA) QDs after repeated intraperitoneal injection into BALB/c mice. The mice were injected every 3?days with various doses of QDs (0, 5, 10 and 25?mg?kg?1). The subsequent effects of QDs on plasma levels of various biomarkers were evaluated at different time points (at 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 15?days). Various tissue samples (spleen, liver, lung, kidneys, brain, heart and thymus) were collected for toxicity analysis, distribution testing, histopathological examination and inflammation assessment. No abnormal clinical signs or behaviors were recorded but the body weight of mice treated with 25?mg?kg?1 QDs was significantly decreased from day 7 compared with control mice. QDs were observed in the liver, spleen, lung and kidneys, but not in brain or heart. Significantly higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase were found in the plasma, liver and spleen. Histopathological examination did not show any tissue toxicity but the levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory marker, were increased in the plasma, liver and spleen. All of these findings provide insight into the observed toxicological effect levels and tissue-specific distribution of CdSe/CdS-MPA QDs. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Ischemia-reperfusion injury impacts early liver graft function. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) as early as at reperfusion has shown to predict in-hospital complications, but its impact on vascular complications and long-term outcomes is not ascertained. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on all consecutive patients transplanted during a 6-year period to define significant early systemic inflammatory response (ESIR). The main end-point was 3-year graft survival. Significant ESIR was defined according to IL-6 level at reperfusion on an exploratory set of 121 patients and validated on an independent cohort (n = 153). Results Significant ESIR was defined as IL-6 at reperfusion >1000 ng/mL in the exploratory cohort. Three-year graft and overall survival were lower in patients with ESIR in the determination set (P = 0.001 and 0.045, respectively). This was confirmed in the validation set (P = 0.045 and 0.027). In patients with high cytolysis, IL-6 identified patients at risk for arterial thrombosis. The main determinants for IL-6 level were intragraft lactate level, cold ischemia time, and anhepatic phase duration (P = 0.005). IL-6 level independently predicted graft survival (P = 0.0003). Conclusions IL-6 at reperfusion is a valid biomarker to predict long-term survival. Furthermore, it helps the interpretation of cytolysis in the prediction of early vascular complications.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the postoperative analgesic effects of intravenous (IV) lidocaine, meloxicam, and their combination in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Animals Twenty-seven dogs aged (mean ± SD) 16.1 ± 7.5 months and weighing 22.4 ± 17.9 kg scheduled for ovariohysterectomy. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Dogs (n = 9 in each group) were allocated to receive just prior to and during surgery one of the following regimens: M group, 0.2 mg kg?1 IV meloxicam then a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of lactated Ringer's at 10 mL kg?1 hour?1; L group, a bolus of lidocaine (1 mg kg?1 IV) then a CRI of lidocaine at 0.025 mg kg?1 minute?1; and M + L group, both the above meloxicam and lidocaine treatments. Pain and sedation were scored, and venous samples taken for serum cortisol and glucose measurement before and at intervals for 12 hours after anaesthesia. Pain scores were assessed using a multi-parameter subjective scoring scale (cumulative scale 0?21) by three observers. The protocol stated that dogs with a total score exceeding 9 or a sub-score above 3 in any one category would receive rescue analgesia. Sedation was scored on a scale of 0?4. Results There were no significant differences in subjective pain scores, serum cortisol, and glucose concentrations between the three groups. The highest pain score at any time was 5, and no dog required rescue analgesia. None of the three regimens caused any observable side effects during or after anaesthesia. At 1 and 2 hours after extubation dogs in group L were significantly more sedated than in the other two groups. Conclusions and Clinical relevance This study suggests that, with the scoring system used, IV lidocaine and meloxicam provide similar and adequate post-operative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - Introduction Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism during muscle contraction and in the balance of anaerobic and aerobic energy production. This study evaluated mitochondrial respirometry in skeletal muscle of eventing horses before and after an intense effort. Methods Fourteen Brazilian Sport Horses 4 to 6 years old performed an incremental velocity test on a high speed treadmill inclined to 3% and galloped at speeds up to 8?m/s until exhaustion. Biopsies from the gluteus medius muscle were obtained before and immediately after the end of the test. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by O2K oxygraph of high resolution (Oroboros). The results were standardized by minute and per gram of wet weight of muscle and expressed as mean?±?SD. Plasma lactate was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were compared by paired t?test (P<0.05). Results The maximal respiration value of mitochondria did not change in gluteus medius muscle of horses at exhaustion. However, there was an increase in stage 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate substrate, and also an increase of non-mitochondrial respiration after exercise. Lactate values before and after exercise were 0.4?±?0.1?mmol/L and 12.1?±?4.6?mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions There is little change in mitochondrial respirometry in the gluteus medius muscle after intense exercise indicating predominantly anaerobic metabolism in the muscle of the eventing horses, as supported by the high plasma lactate concentrations after the test. The increase of oxidase reactions after intense exercise is related to an increase in non-mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Introduction The effects of different amounts of training on performance of young horses have not yet been studied in a long term perspective. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect on VLa4 of two training programs performed from the age of 2 to 3 in Standardbred horses. Methods Fourteen horses were in March as 2-year olds divided into two groups; one was randomized to a training program including intensive exercise (control) and the other to a training program with reduced amount of intensive exercise (distance ?30% compared to control). Group division was partly based on breeding index (means: control 110, reduced 109) and gluteus medius fiber type ratio (IIA/IIB, both groups mean 1.34). Horses were trained ?2 times/week. After 14 months, a VLa4-test was performed on a track (4?x?1000?m). Speed was measured by GPS and increased by ?3?s/1000?m for every interval. Blood samples were collected after each interval and lactate concentration was determined using Lactate Pro. Exponential regression analysis of speed and lactate concentration were used to estimate individual VLa4. ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in VLa4 between the control and reduced exercise group (10.6?±?0.1 and 10.8?±?0.1?m/s). Conclusions The study indicates that it might be possible to reduce the amount of intensive training by ≤30% without impairing performance of 3 year old Standardbred horses.

AB  - Introduction There is little information about biochemical and physiologic responses to exercise in Brazilian gaited horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate blood biomarkers and heart rate (HR) in gaited horses during a standardized gaited field test (SGT). Methods Sixteen horses performed a SGT (10?min warm-up, 30?min of marcha gait and 15?min recovery). Blood samples and HR were collected at rest, after warm-up, after 15 (F?+?15) and 30?min (F?+?30) of marcha, and after recovery. Assays were performed to measure glucose, lactate, total plasma protein, hematocrit, urea, creatinine, glutamine, glutamate, triglycerides, total cholesterol, Ca, P, Mg, Na, Cl and K. HR was measured using a HR monitor. Results were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc analyses included the Holm-Sidak test, Student's t-tests, and Pearson's correlation analyses. The null hypothesis was rejected when P<0.05. Results [Glucose] and [lactate] increased during SGT (P<0.05). A significant interaction between phase of SGT and fitness level was observed for [glucose] but not for [lactate]. The SGT also produced increases (P<0.05) in hematocrit, [TPP], [urea], [creatinine], [triglycerides], [P] and [K] and a reduction (P<0.05) in [Ca]. HR increased from ?47?bpm at rest, to ?140?bpm at F?+?15 and F?+?30 (P<0.05). Conclusions This study documents submaximal aerobic exercise, as performed during the GST is sufficient to alter energy biomarkers in gaited horses.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the response in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit and plasma lactate concentration in Icelandic horses performing the riding assessment in an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) in Iceland (April 2011). It was hypothesized that the riding assessment constituted high intensity exercise. Methods Data was collected from 15 of 28 horses shown at the BEFT. Horses were judged for riding abilities (all gaits) on a straight track. Respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein before the warm-up and within 5?min after the riding assessment. Hematocrit was analysed by centrifugation of capillary tubes and plasma lactate concentration using an enzymatic and spectrophotometric method. Velocity, distance and heart rate were recorded (Polar, Kempele, Finland) during the riding assessment. Anova (Proc GLM) was performed in SAS and data is presented as LSMean ±?SE (P<0.05). Results The distance covered was 2.7?±?0.1?km, the duration 9:13?±?0:21?min?:?sec and the average speed 17.5?±?0.3?km/h. The peak heart rate was 214?±?3?bpm. Post-exercise plasma lactate concentration was 18.6?±?1.7?mmol/L and there was an increase (P<0.001) in respiratory rate (40?±?6 to 118?±?6 breaths/min), rectal temperature (38.1?±?0.1 to 39.8?±?0.1°C) and hematocrit (35?±?2 to 47?±?2%) following the breed evaluation field test. Conclusions The physiological responses indicate that the riding assessment in BEFT is a demanding exercise, requiring some contribution of anaerobic metabolism. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the National Animal Research Committee of Iceland. Owners and trainers were informed that participation was voluntary.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

The aim of this study was to assess indications, use patterns and short-term effects of FBT in a paediatric ED. Methods Retrospective observational study in the ED of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (annual census >90?000) using hospital electronic medical record data for all patients who received an i.v. fluid bolus in the ED over the calendar year 2018 were included in the study. We extracted demographics, indications, volume, content of FBT as well as subsequent vital sign and biochemical changes. Results One thousand five hundred and thirty-nine fluid boluses were administered to 1343/90?000 children (1.5%), 1185 received 1, 123 received 2, 32 received 3, and 3 received 4 boluses. Fluid bolus volume of 10 mL/kg was used in 45.3%, 20?mL/kg in 35.7%, 500?mL in 6.4% and 1000?mL in 7.1%. The fluid content was 0.9% saline in 99.9% of cases. The most common indications for FBT were: vomiting/diarrhoea (23%), acute febrile illness (11%) and pneumonia or sepsis (10% each). FBT was associated with a reduction in median heart rate by 6 beats per minute (P?<?0.01), reduction in mean blood pressure by 3?mmHg (P?<?0.01), and reduction in venous lactate by 0.2?mmol/L (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Fluid bolus therapy is a commonly used intervention in the paediatric ED, most often for dehydration. Variability in indications, dose and effects of FBT warrant further exploration.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required to support the metabolic demands of rapid malignant cell growth. Using orthotopic mouse models of human glioblastoma (GBM) and renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain, we estimated the activity of the PPP relative to glycolysis by infusing [1,2-13C2]glucose. The [3-13C]lactate/[2,3-13C2]lactate ratio was similar for both the GBM and brain metastasis and their respective surrounding brains (GBM, 0.197?±?0.011 and 0.195?±?0.033, respectively (p?=?1); metastasis: 0.126 and 0.119?±?0.033, respectively). This suggests that the rate of glycolysis is significantly greater than the PPP flux in these tumors, and that the PPP flux into the lactate pool is similar in both tumors. Remarkably, 13C?13C coupling was observed in molecules derived from Krebs cycle intermediates in both tumor types, denoting glucose oxidation. In the renal cell carcinoma, in contrast with GBM, 13C multiplets of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) differed from its precursor glutamate, suggesting that GABA did not derive from a common glutamate precursor pool. In addition, the orthotopic renal tumor, the patient's primary renal mass and brain metastasis were all strongly immunopositive for the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase, as were 84% of tumors on a renal cell carcinoma tissue microarray of the same histology, suggesting that GABA synthesis is cell autonomous in at least a subset of renal cell carcinomas. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 13C-labeled glucose can be used in orthotopic mouse models to study tumor metabolism in vivo and to ascertain new metabolic targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - Background Various treatments are available for ear mite infestations in dogs. Objective The efficacy of sarolaner was evaluated against ear mite infestation caused by Otodectes cynotis in dogs and compared with topical moxidectin/imidacloprid in a single-masked, multi-centre field study. Animals Client-owned dogs with O. cynotis infestation were treated monthly with oral sarolaner (n = 163) or topical moxidectin/imidacloprid (n = 78). Methods The presence of mites in the ear canals and the clinical signs associated with otoacariasis (including head shaking, pruritus/ear scratching, trauma or alopecia of the pinnae, and erythema, ulceration and debris in the ear canals) was evaluated on days 0, 14 and 30, and, if applicable, on day 60. Dogs were considered cured of mite infestation following one (on day 0) or two (on days 0 and 30) monthly treatments, if no live mites were found in either ear. Non-inferiority was evaluated at days 14 and 30. Results Parasitological cure was achieved in 76.4%, 90.5% and 93.3% of the sarolaner-treated and in 53.9%, 63.5% and 66.7% of the moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated dogs on days 14, 30 and 60, respectively. At study completion, on day 60 at the latest, parasitological cure was achieved overall in 99.4% of sarolaner-treated and 87.8% of moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated cases. The parasitological cure rate for sarolaner was non-inferior to moxidectin/imidacloprid at days 14 and 30. The clinical signs of otoacariasis improved throughout the study in both groups. There were no treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions A single oral administration of sarolaner was safe and highly effective in the treatment of O. cynotis infestation in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the impact of acepromazine on the cardiovascular responses to three treatments for hypotension in dogs during deep isoflurane anesthesia. Study design? Prospective blinded randomized cross-over experimental design. Animals? Six adult (2.5?±?0.5?year old) healthy mixed breed dogs (24.2?±?7.6?kg). Methods? Anesthesia was induced with propofol (4?6?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane. Each dog received six treatments separated by at least 5?days. Once instrumented, dogs randomly received acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) (Ace) or saline (equal volume) (Sal) IV and end-tidal isoflurane (E?Iso) was adjusted to achieve hypotension, defined as a mean blood pressure between 45 and 50?mmHg. Dogs randomly received dextran (D) (7?mL?kg?1) or lactated Ringer?s (LR) (20?mL?kg?1) over 14?minutes, or ephedrine (Eph) (0.1?mg?kg?1 followed by 10??g?kg?1?minute?1) throughout the study. Measurements were taken at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40?minutes. Data were analyzed with a Latin Square in two factors (Ace/Sal and treatment) for repeated measures, with further comparisons if appropriate (p?<?0.05). Results? E?Iso producing hypotension was significantly less following Ace (2.07?±?0.23%) than Sal (2.43?±?0.23%). No improvement in cardiac output (CO) was observed with D or LR. LR initially intensified hypotension with a significant reduction in SVR, while D caused a minor improvement in ABP. Eph produced a significant increase in ABP, CO, hemoglobin, oxygen content and delivery. Pre-treatment with Ace minimized ABP improvements with all treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1 IV) enhanced the hypotensive effect of isoflurane, although it maintained CO. Administration of LR significantly worsens ABP initially by further vasodilation. D caused minimal improvement in ABP. At the infusion studied, Eph effectively countered the cardiovascular depression produced by deep isoflurane anesthesia, but extremes in ABP associated with initial vasoconstriction prevent our recommendation at this dose.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the abdominal and abdominal vascular injury. The presence of a seat belt sign (SBS) on the abdomen is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal injuries. In adult populations, the presence of an SBS increases the risk of intra-abdominal injury twofold to eightfold. An SBS may be even more concerning in pediatric patients where rates of intra-abdominal injury can be increased as much as twelvefold. Damage-control surgery (DCS) has been applied to many surgical conditions including nontraumatic abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. For the trauma patient in extremis with noncompressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is gaining popularity as an alternative to resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic clamping. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect many body systems including neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and genitourinary.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. Data Sources Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: ?tissue oxygen monitoring,? ?near-infrared tissue spectroscopy,? and ?tissue oxygen saturation (StO2).? Human Data Synthesis Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. Veterinary Data Synthesis Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. Conclusion Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.
