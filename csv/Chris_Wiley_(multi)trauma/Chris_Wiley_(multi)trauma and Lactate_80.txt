AB  - The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in wound healing is well established. These interactions likely involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-ß family. TGF-ß1, ß2 and ß3 isoforms signal by sequentially binding to the TGF-ß type II and type I receptors, respectively. We address the role of TGF-ß signaling in dermal fibroblasts using a conditional fibroblastic TGF-ß type II receptor knockout mouse model (termed FßKO). We found that the loss of TGF-ß signaling in the dermal fibroblasts results in accelerated excision-wound closure compared with similar wounds in wild type mice. The mechanism of the altered rate of re-epitheliaization in the FßKO mice was examined with regard to keratiocyte motility and proliferation. The migration of keratinocytes through collagen I coated 8??m pore filters in the presence or absence of fibroblast-conditioned media was tested. These experiments showed increased keratinocyte migration when incubated with FßKO dermal fibroblast conditioned media compared to media conditioned in wild type fibroblasts. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded intact skin indicated both wild type and FßKO mice had similar low levels of keratinocyte proliferation, based on Ki67 staining. In healing wounds, only the distal wound edges of wild type mice were proliferative. In contrast, the FßKO mice exhibited elevated proliferation across the length of the wound, including the leading edge of epithelial closure. Together our results suggest TGF-ß signaling by the dermal fibroblasts suppresses re-epithelialization of excision wounds by regulating keratinocyte motility and proliferation through paracrine mechanisms. ?

AB  - Aim : An antimicrobial dressing that combines high absorbency and potent antimicrobial properties. The unique composition of the dressing manages exudates in moderate to heavily exuding, infected or critically colonised wounds, which creates a favourable environment for effective wound management. Methods : Two test methods were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the dressing: 1) A zone of inhibition sensitivity test that challenges the dressing to a seeded agar plate and 2) A log reduction test that exposes a small sample of dressing against a high bacterial loaded broth, measuring the log reduction of the bacteria over a specified time period. The absorbency of the dressing was evaluated using British Pharmacopoeia test methods. Results : The antimicrobial dressing has been shown to be highly effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans and also against resistant organisms MRSE, MRSA and VRE. The product is highly absorbent with absorbency?>?16?g/g and 16?g/m2.

AB  - Elderly hospital patients have ample exposure to situations and procedures that may increase their pressure ulcer risk. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in elderly medical patients and to determine whether the risk of pressure ulcers is associated with longer emergency department (ED) stays, lengthy procedures in the ED, or use of immobilizing restraints, medications, or devices in the ED. The study cohort was made up of 3,233 patients aged 65 or over admitted through the EDs of two Philadelphia hospitals. Sixty-five percent of subjects were aged 80 or more, 61% were female, and 69% were Black. The incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers on Day 3 of the hospital stay, as ascertained by direct skin examination, was 6.2%. There were 266 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers among 201 patients (mean per patient 1.3 pressure ulcers) 27% of the pressure ulcers were stage 1, 54% were stage 2, and the remainder were stages 3 or 4 or could not be staged. The median length of stay in the ED was 6.6 hours. The association between hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and extrinsic risk factors will be presented. The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors may lead to the development of effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.

AB  - Introduction: Thermal injury to the female breast is one of the most challenging aspects of aesthetic burn surgery today. As the ability to provide coverage for large body surface injuries has progressed greatly in recent years; attention can now be directed towards achieving aesthetically pleasing results. Breast reconstruction in the burn patient can be accomplished in several ways. In planning the reconstruction, one must account for gender, age, and stage of breast development at the time of injury. The following is the treatment protocol utilized at our institution. After determining the level of injury the injured area is cleansed and treated with topical anti-microbial agents such as Silvadene. If the decision is made to excise and graft the injured area one of two algorithms is followed. The first choice involves excising the burn and placing a split thickness skin graft to the area involved. This is done by placing a sheet graft and using aerosolized fibrin sealant to affix it to the wound bed. If the burn involves deeper elements of tissue then a second approach is taken which includes excision of the burn down to the level of fascia with preservation of the breast mounds and the nipple areola complex (NAR). The (NAR) is spared excision and allowed to heal. Reconstruction of the (NAR) can be deferred for a secondary procedure depending upon the response to primary healing. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to the area of injury. Again a sheet graft is preferred and fibrin sealant is utilized to improve graft fixation and contour. We attribute our excellent results to the sheet grafts and fibrin sealant used. It should be noted that the increased vascularity of the breast fat when compared to fat located elsewhere in the body allows the grafts to adhere and survive on this generally difficult to graft surface. Methods: We identified five female patients at our institution over the last 18 months with thermal injuries to the breasts. Each patient was placed into one of the two treatment algorithms. Results: The five patients had excellent outcomes. Breast mounds and symmetry were preserved. Further development of the breast was allowed in each patient. One patient even underwent a breast augmentation after surviving a 50% TBSA injury. Proper use of fibrin sealant and sheet grafts account for the excellent results seen at this institution. Conclusion: Following careful evaluation of the burned female breast cosmetically and functionally acceptable results can be attained when following our institution?s protocol for breast reconstruction in the female burn victim.

AB  - Aim: To document successful healing of a recalcitrant venous ulcer with adjunctive use of Dermagraft Materials and Methods: A 74-year-old Hispanic male presented with a chronic venous ulcer at the medial aspect of his right ankle. Biopsy failed to reveal malignancy and confirmed stasis changes. Treatment was ongoing including compression therapy, local debridements, and moist wound healing, off-loading, and nutritional support. The wound remained free of infection. Due to the continued recalcitrant nature of the lesion multiple applications of Dermagraft were utilized to augment healing. Results: The researcher observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue. Conclusions: Dermagraft appears to augment healing in patients with venous ulcers and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgements: Smith & Nephew Wound Management, Largo, Fl.

AB  - The use of adjunctive peri-wound, ultrasound with either a 1?MgHz or 3?MgHz frequency has been reported on in the literature with variable results. MIST ultrasound therapy is a novel application of direct wound bed application of kilohertz ultrasound waves utilizing a normal saline mist as the coupling mechanism, allowing for no direct patient contact. The mist generated by the system is of relative uniform particle size and acts as a conduit of ultrasound energy. Unlike ultrasonic baths, which dissipate the vibrational energy over a large area, the transducer horn focuses the energy into a smaller area of application. The MIST? system consists of an ultrasonic power supply (generator), a transducer (or alternately referred to as the converter), and an applicator coupled to the transducer. The generator converts voltage to high frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is transmitted to the piezoelectric transducer within the converter, where it is changed to mechanical vibrations. The generator is designed to operate the converter at 40?kHz with a distal displacement of 60 microns. Published reports have described various biological effects of low frequency ultrasound including VEGF and PDGF production, increased protein synthesis, improved bone and wound healing. Other authors have published abstracts demonstrating clinical efficacy of this device on a broad range of patients with recalcitrant wounds. This report describes the clinical results of a prospective, non-randomized, efficacy trial, adding MIST ultrasound therapy to current treatment protocols in recalcitrant wounds. Wound healing trajectories before and after treatment will be evaluated and wound healing will be assessed with laser Doppler image analysis and trans-cutaneous oximetry.

AB  - Background: More than three quarters of patients with a connective tissue disorder will develop secondary Raynauld?s disease. This more severe form of the Raynauld?s can lead to digital ischemia, tissue loss and may even result in the need for amputation of one or more digits. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor currently approved for use in vascular disease of the lower extremities. Case History: In August of 2002 a 62 year old female pianist with scleroderma presented to the wound clinic with a two year history of intractable digital pain secondary to ischemic ulcerations of the index, long and ring fingers of the right hand. She suffered from secondary Raynauld?s disease. Prior unsuccessful treatments included warming the hands, calcium channel blockade, anticoagulation, topical xylocaine and narcotic analgesics. In August of 2002 cilostazol was started at 100mg BID. Wound care consisted of serial debridement, moist wound healing and topical rhPDGF. Results: Four weeks into treatment the patient?s narcotic requirement decreased substantially and the fingers had a pink appearance. The ring finger healed after eight weeks. At three months the patient discontinued narcotic pain medication. Nine months into treatment the index finger had healed and she resumed playing the piano. The long finger finally healed one year after she initially presented to the wound clinic. Conclusion: Cilostazol may be an important adjunct in the treatment of secondary Raynauld?s disease particularly when digital ischemia has developed.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - ABSTRACT The treatment of articular cartilage injury and disease has become an increasingly relevant part of orthopaedic care. Articular cartilage transplantation, in the form of osteochondral allografting, is one of the most established techniques for restoration of articular cartilage. Our research efforts over the last two decades have supported the transformation of this procedure from experimental ?niche? status to a cornerstone of orthopaedic practice. In this Kappa Delta paper, we describe our translational and clinical science contributions to this transformation: (1) to enhance the ability of tissue banks to process and deliver viable tissue to surgeons and patients, (2) to improve the biological understanding of in vivo cartilage and bone remodeling following osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation in an animal model system, (3) to define effective surgical techniques and pitfalls, and (4) to identify and clarify clinical indications and outcomes. The combination of coordinated basic and clinical studies is part of our continuing comprehensive academic OCA transplant program. Taken together, the results have led to the current standards for OCA processing and storage prior to implantation and also novel observations and mechanisms of the biological and clinical behavior of OCA transplants in vivo. Thus, OCA transplantation is now a successful and increasingly available treatment for patients with disabling osteoarticular cartilage pathology. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.
