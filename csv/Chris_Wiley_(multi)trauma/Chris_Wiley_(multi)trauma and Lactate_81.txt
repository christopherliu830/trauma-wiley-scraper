AB  - ABSTRACT The treatment of articular cartilage injury and disease has become an increasingly relevant part of orthopaedic care. Articular cartilage transplantation, in the form of osteochondral allografting, is one of the most established techniques for restoration of articular cartilage. Our research efforts over the last two decades have supported the transformation of this procedure from experimental ?niche? status to a cornerstone of orthopaedic practice. In this Kappa Delta paper, we describe our translational and clinical science contributions to this transformation: (1) to enhance the ability of tissue banks to process and deliver viable tissue to surgeons and patients, (2) to improve the biological understanding of in vivo cartilage and bone remodeling following osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation in an animal model system, (3) to define effective surgical techniques and pitfalls, and (4) to identify and clarify clinical indications and outcomes. The combination of coordinated basic and clinical studies is part of our continuing comprehensive academic OCA transplant program. Taken together, the results have led to the current standards for OCA processing and storage prior to implantation and also novel observations and mechanisms of the biological and clinical behavior of OCA transplants in vivo. Thus, OCA transplantation is now a successful and increasingly available treatment for patients with disabling osteoarticular cartilage pathology. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has a high sensitivity for detecting metastasis from melanoma, but its application in early-stage melanomas is questionable. The purpose of this study was to determine if positron emission tomography (PET) is beneficial in staging of clinically node negative (cN0) head and neck melanoma. Methods After institutional review board approval, patients with head and neck melanoma treated at 2 cancer centers (between 2000 and 2010) were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes. A retrospective medical chart review of cN0 patients was performed for the treatment course and outcomes. Results A total of 165 patients were treated; of these, 106 were node negative. FDG-PET was included in initial staging of 47 cN0 patients. None had true distant metastasis detected on PET. The imaging also failed to detect nodal metastasis in 2 patients who had disease on lymphatic sampling. Conclusion FDG-PET did not alter the initial staging or treatment in patients with cN0 head and neck melanoma. Therefore, its routine use for staging is not warranted. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - 1. Intracellular recordings were made, in vitro, and in situ, from neurones of the cat stellate ganglion. 2. Preganglionic stimulation, in vitro, via the T3 ramus or post-ganglionic stimulation via the ventral ansa, dorsal ansa or stellate cardiac nerve evoked graded synaptic responses which led to the discharge of one or more action potentials. Since the conduction velocities of fibres converging onto a single cell may vary, their convergence may mean that there is an interaction in the stellate ganglion between functionally different pathways. 3. Most neurones in the stellate ganglion receive synaptic input from fibres of both central and peripheral origin. 4. Intracellular recordings were made, in situ, from neurones of the cat stellate ganglion attached via the stellate cardiac nerve to the rest of the animal. When peripheral sympathetic afferent input to the stellate ganglion was increased by occluding the descending aorta, some of the neurones exhibited an increase in excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) and/or action potentials. Most of the synaptic input recorded from the ganglion cells in situ had a close relationship with the cardiac cycle and/or respiration. 5. These data and our previous studies support the contention that sympathetic efferent nerve activity can be modified by peripheral excitatory inputs and that these neural connexions may function as pathways for a peripheral reflex at the level of the paravertebral ganglion.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Summary Patients with a variety of haematological conditions are at risk of infection and its most serious complication: septic shock. Mortality for septic shock remains high and especially so in patients with haematological malignancy and following bone marrow transplantation. However, advances in the treatment of severe sepsis have improved mortality rates even though evidence for the management of severe sepsis in haematology patients is limited. Wherever possible this review will concentrate on evidence directly applicable to haematology patients but inevitably will have to extrapolate evidence from other patient groups. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines 2008 provide information on best practice in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and are broadly applicable though not specific to haematology patients. This review summarizes a practical approach to the management of severe sepsis in haematology patients and highlights areas of research which may bring new treatments in the future. The review is limited to the management and initial resuscitation of septic shock in adult haematology patients and will not address the detailed intensive care management of these patients or the management of severe sepsis in children.

AB  - Background Changes in water balance and the presence of unmeasured anions perturb the inverse relationship between serum chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations in people, affecting accurate interpretation of acid-base status. Objectives The aim of this study was to demonstrate that corrected serum Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations, based on serum sodium (Na) concentration and anion gap (AG), would be inversely correlated and could be used to better characterize causes of acid-base disorders in dogs. Methods In this retrospective study, electrolyte data from dogs with at least one abnormality in serum Na, Cl, or HCO3 concentrations were analyzed. Profiles were classified before and after calculations using 2 methods, a modified Feldman and an institutional method, to correct Cl concentration and predict HCO3 concentrations based on Na concentration and AG. Dogs were classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) based on Cl (first letter) and HCO3 (second letter) concentrations, as follows: LL, LN, LH, NL, NN, NH, HL, HN, or HH. Results For profiles from 261 dogs, reclassifying corrected Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations resulted in a shift from the initial classification into a different one in 73% of dogs; in most cases, the shift was to LH, NN, or HL categories. Albumin concentration was a significant factor in acid-base balance. Conclusions When interpreting acid-base status based on results of a standard biochemical panel, erroneous conclusions can be drawn if concentrations of Na, unmeasured anions, and albumin are not taken into account. The inverse relationship between serum Cl and HCO3 concentrations may be used to identify frequent acid-base disorders as well as to unmask abnormalities obscured by irregularities in water balance or AG.

AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.
