AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.

AB  - Abstract Platelet concentrates stored for 5 days under currently optimal conditions at 22 C demonstrate approximately a 20?30% loss of viability as determined by CCI measurements in thrombocytopenic patients and radiolabeling studies with healthy volunteers. The functionality of platelets is substantially lost during storage. This loss appears, for most part, to be reversible upon infusion. In view of this, stored platelets should be acceptable for prophylactic treatment of thrombocytopenic patients in whom immediate hemostatic function is not critical. However, whether stored platelets are functionally adequate for immediate arrest of perioperative bleeding in surgical patients remain uncertain. Currently, a fully adequate and appropriate test that evaluates the hemostatic function of a stored platelet product is not available. In view of this, a desired goal in research and development of new platelet products may then be to attain a platelet product that is similar to fresh platelets in various haemostatic functions. Whether this is an obtainable or relevant goal remains to be seen.

AB  - Abstract What is known and objective Amlodipine overdose is common; however, the dose and timing of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy as a management strategy remain debatable. Case description A 73-year-old man received a single bolus (1.5 mL/kg) of ILE therapy following massive ingestion of multiple drugs, including amlodipine. After approximately 20 hours of ILE therapy, the serum amlodipine level that had decreased from 90.2 to 49.9 ng/mL increased to 70.8 ng/mL. What is new and conclusion A single bolus (1.5 mL/kg) of ILE therapy is probably insufficient to completely capture and partition serum amlodipine following amlodipine overdose.

AB  - Background Brain death and complications to brain death affects the function of organs in the potential donor. Previous animal models of brain death have not been able to fully elucidate the mechanisms behind this organ dysfunction, and none of the available animal models mimic the most common insult prior to brain death: intracerebral haemorrhage. The objective of this study was to develop a large animal model of brain death based on a controlled intracerebral haemorrhage and verified by computerised tomographic angiography (CTA). Methods Twenty pigs (range: 26.6?31.2?kg) were randomised to brain death or control. Brain death was induced by infusion of blood through a stereotaxically placed needle in the internal capsule. Brain death was confirmed by the measured intracranial pressure (ICP), lack of corneal and pupillary light reflexes, and atropine test. CTA was performed 120?180?min after brain death. The pigs were observed for 8?h after brain death. Results Brain death was declared when the ICP exceeded mean arterial pressure after a median of 36?min (range: 28?51?min). Significant increases in heart rate, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were followed by a steep decrease. With fluid therapy, the animals demonstrated haemodynamic stability. Reflexes disappeared, and atropine did not induce an increase in heart rate in the brain dead animals. CTA confirmed loss of cerebral circulation. Conclusion This study offers a standardised, clinically relevant porcine model of brain death induced by a haemorrhagic attack. Brain death was verified by the disappearance of corneal and pupil reflex, atropine test, and CTA.

AB  - Practitioners working in limited resourced field conditions are often confronted with patients suffering from a myriad of exceptionally challenging medical conditions in the face of limited medical supplies and staff, as well as no options for referral. This chapter presents practical treatment protocols for commonly observed medical conditions based on accumulated field experience from veterinarians working in the field.

AB  - Summary Infection in labour poses a real danger to both the woman and the baby and could escalate if untreated. Routine labour care tends to focus on pregnancy-related infections, example urinary or uterine infections, but always take seriously any woman who arrives in labour feeling unwell, even if the illness seems unrelated to pregnancy, example respiratory/gastric-type illness. A small but significant proportion of women develop complications which may threaten their lives or those of their babies. Emergency situations can be stressful and provoke a range of emotional responses and consequences for all involved. The woman may experience acute respiratory distress, collapse, seizures or cardiac arrest with no immediate or obvious diagnosis. The rapidly deteriorating situation can be extremely stressful for staff and birth partners, particularly as death often results. However, high-quality, rapid intensive multiprofessional care can increase survival and improve outcomes.
