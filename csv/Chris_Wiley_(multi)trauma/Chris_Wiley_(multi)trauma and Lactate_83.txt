AB  - Summary Anesthesia for neurosurgery presents an interesting challenge to the pediatric anesthesiologist. One has little control over the patient's primary lesion, but the selection of anesthetic technique and the recognition of perioperative events and changes may profoundly reduce or prevent significant morbidity. Current neuroanesthetic practice is based on the understanding of cerebral physiology and how it can be manipulated in the presence of intracranial pathology. The pediatric neuroanesthesiologist also must contend with the physiological differences in developing children. In addition to the common problems of administering anesthesia to the general pediatric population, special consideration must be given to the effects of anesthesia on the central nervous system of children with neurological diseases. This chapter reviews the fundamentals of the clinical management in neurosurgical patients. Discussion of specific neurosurgical conditions and their respective anesthetic management is designed to highlight the common and sometimes unique problems encountered by the pediatric neuroanesthesiologist.

AB  - Summary Infection in labour poses a real danger to both the woman and the baby and could escalate if untreated. Routine labour care tends to focus on pregnancy-related infections, example urinary or uterine infections, but always take seriously any woman who arrives in labour feeling unwell, even if the illness seems unrelated to pregnancy, example respiratory/gastric-type illness. A small but significant proportion of women develop complications which may threaten their lives or those of their babies. Emergency situations can be stressful and provoke a range of emotional responses and consequences for all involved. The woman may experience acute respiratory distress, collapse, seizures or cardiac arrest with no immediate or obvious diagnosis. The rapidly deteriorating situation can be extremely stressful for staff and birth partners, particularly as death often results. However, high-quality, rapid intensive multiprofessional care can increase survival and improve outcomes.

AB  - Summary Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans causing superficial mucosal infections and life-threatening systemic disease. The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between the invading pathogen and the host innate immune system. As a result, the polysaccharides that comprise the cell wall act as pathogen associated molecular patterns, which govern the host?pathogen interaction. The cell wall is dynamic and responsive to changes in the external environment. Therefore, the host environment plays a critical role in regulating the host?pathogen interaction through modulation of the fungal cell wall. This review focuses on how environmental adaptation modulates the cell wall structure and composition, and the subsequent impact this has on the innate immune recognition of C.?albicans.

AB  - Background It is not clear whether patients entering a specialized, interdisciplinary weaning unit from surgical or medical intensive care units (ICU) distinguish substantially. The purpose of the present study was to assess differences in patients with prolonged weaning being referred from surgical and medical ICU. Methods Data collected from April 2013 to April 2014 was conducted for retrospective analysis. Mortality rates, demographic data, clinical, and microbial differences in 150 patients with prolonged weaning were assessed (80 surgical and 70 medical). Results Surgical ICU referrals tended to be older (70.7 ± 11.3 vs. 67.3 ± 12.3, P = 0.051) and had fewer underlying pulmonary diseases (45% vs. 60%, P = 0.067). Sodium values at the time of referral to the weaning unit were significantly higher in surgical (147.1 ± 9.6) vs. medical (141.3 ± 6.7 mmol/l) patients (P < 0.001). Each 10-unit increase in sodium at the time of referral to the weaning unit was associated with a 2.5-day (95% CI ?0.4, 5.4; P = 0.09) prolongation of stay in the weaning unit. Although significant differences in microbiological agents from tracheal aspiration were seen, the infection rate on the weaning unit was similar in both groups. There was no difference in weaning unit mortality between surgical and medical ICU patients (18% vs. 23%; P = 0.41). Conclusion Few differences were found between patients being referred to a specialized weaning unit from surgical vs. medical ICUs. Besides differences in microbiological characteristics of tracheal secretions, there were also differences in sodium levels, which appear to influence on treatment duration.

AB  - Objective In recent years, there has been a blossoming of studies examining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a method of studying the pathophysiology of delirium. We systematically reviewed the literature for CSF studies in delirium and provide here a summary of the implications for our understanding of delirium pathophysiology. We also summarise the methods used for CSF analysis and discuss challenges and implications for future studies. Methods In this systematic review, we screened MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles on CSF biomarkers in delirium, published on 3 September 2016. Studies were required to use Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria for delirium or a validated tool. We excluded case reports. There were no other restrictions on study type. Results We identified 3280 articles from our initial search, and 22 articles were included in this review. All studies were prospective, including over 400 patients with delirium and 700 controls. More than 70 different biomarkers were studied. Studies could not be compared with each other for meta-analysis because of their heterogeneity and varied widely in their risk of bias and quality assessments. Conclusions The 22 studies identified in this review reveal a small but growing literature, in which many of the important hypotheses in delirium pathogenesis have been examined, but from which few firm conclusions can currently be drawn. Nevertheless, the overall interpretation of the literature supports the vulnerable brain concept, that is, that biomarker evidence of, for example, Alzheimer's disease pathology and/or neuroinflammation, is associated with delirium.
