AB  - ABSTRACT Since the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma in 1948, it has been investigated as a non-invasive screening tool for many diseases, especially solid tumours and foetal genetic abnormalities. However, to date our lack of knowledge regarding the origin and purpose of cfDNA in a physiological environment has limited its use to more obvious diagnostics, neglecting, for example, its potential utility in the identification of predisposition to disease, earlier detection of cancers, and lifestyle-induced epigenetic changes. Moreover, the concept or mechanism of cfDNA could also have potential therapeutic uses such as in immuno- or gene therapy. This review presents an extensive compilation of the putative origins of cfDNA and then contrasts the contributions of cellular breakdown processes with active mechanisms for the release of cfDNA into the extracellular environment. The involvement of cfDNA derived from both cellular breakdown and active release in lateral information transfer is also discussed. We hope to encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic view of cfDNA research, taking into account all the biological pathways in which cfDNA is involved, and to give serious consideration to the integration of in vitro and in vivo research. We also wish to encourage researchers not to limit their focus to the apoptotic or necrotic fraction of cfDNA, but to investigate the intercellular messaging capabilities of the actively released fraction of cfDNA and to study the role of cfDNA in pathogenesis.

AB  - ABSTRACT In recent years, a higher and higher percentage of patients with pleural effusions or pneumothorax are being treated with small-bore (10?14?F) chest tubes rather than large-bore (>20?F). However, there are very few randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy and complication rates with the small- and large-bore catheters. Moreover, the randomized trials that are available have flaws in their design. The advantages of the small-bore catheters are that they are easier to insert and there is less pain with their insertion while they are in place. The placement of the small-bore catheters is probably more optimal when placement is done with ultrasound guidance. Small-bore chest tubes are recommended when pleurodesis is performed. The success of the small-bore indwelling tunnelled catheters that are left in place for weeks documents that the small-bore tubes do not commonly become obstructed with fibrin. Patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions are probably best managed with small-bore catheters even when the pleural fluid is purulent. Patients with haemothorax are best managed with large-bore catheters because of blood clots and the high volume of pleural fluid. Most patients with pneumothorax can be managed with aspiration or small-bore chest tubes. If these fail, a large-bore chest tube may be necessary. Patients on mechanical ventilation with barotrauma induced pneumothoraces are best managed with large-bore chest tubes.

AB  - Abstract Electroanalysis involves the measurement or determination of a chemical or biochemical species, using a wide range of electrochemical methods. The species being measured can either bring about a direct electrochemical response that can be detected and measured, or can be induced to bring about such a response, resulting in a process that can be detected electrochemically. In both cases an interface is required between the chemical or biochemical species being measured, and the electrochemical system performing the measurement. This interface is referred to as an ?electrode?. It is the transfer of electrons or ions between the electrode and the environment being sampled which is of concern in electroanalysis. The application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis is concerned with the measurement of chemical and biochemical species present in biological fluids (primarily blood but also urine and other body fluids and tissues). It is applied in several areas of critical care where its rapidity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy at biologically relevant concentrations make it an ideal choice over other, typically slower, biochemical techniques. Indeed, it is the speed of electrochemical analysis that principally differentiates it from other methods. It is not universally applicable to clinical chemistry, however, and has only been applied in situations where such analyses are relevant. This has principally been in the analysis of blood gases and pH and blood electrolytes. Electrochemical methods are, however, gradually being extended to the analysis of small biochemical components such as sugars, amino acids and other metabolites, with the advent of enzyme-based ?biosensors?. There is also little doubt that the application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis will be further exploited by the use of such biosensor devices based on other forms of biorecognition, such as antibodies, cell ligands, membranes, tissues and whole cells. These biosensor devices are also amenable to other forms of detection such as acoustic wave and optical measurements. Together, these techniques offer a wide range of advantages over traditional analytical methodologies, and will undoubtedly have a rapidly increasing impact on many types of clinical analysis. This article focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques and electrochemical biosensors and their application in clinical chemistry.
