AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma in 1948, it has been investigated as a non-invasive screening tool for many diseases, especially solid tumours and foetal genetic abnormalities. However, to date our lack of knowledge regarding the origin and purpose of cfDNA in a physiological environment has limited its use to more obvious diagnostics, neglecting, for example, its potential utility in the identification of predisposition to disease, earlier detection of cancers, and lifestyle-induced epigenetic changes. Moreover, the concept or mechanism of cfDNA could also have potential therapeutic uses such as in immuno- or gene therapy. This review presents an extensive compilation of the putative origins of cfDNA and then contrasts the contributions of cellular breakdown processes with active mechanisms for the release of cfDNA into the extracellular environment. The involvement of cfDNA derived from both cellular breakdown and active release in lateral information transfer is also discussed. We hope to encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic view of cfDNA research, taking into account all the biological pathways in which cfDNA is involved, and to give serious consideration to the integration of in vitro and in vivo research. We also wish to encourage researchers not to limit their focus to the apoptotic or necrotic fraction of cfDNA, but to investigate the intercellular messaging capabilities of the actively released fraction of cfDNA and to study the role of cfDNA in pathogenesis.

AB  - Machine perfusion (MP) has been used as the kidney preservation method in our center for over 10 years. The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Electroanalysis involves the measurement or determination of a chemical or biochemical species, using a wide range of electrochemical methods. The species being measured can either bring about a direct electrochemical response that can be detected and measured, or can be induced to bring about such a response, resulting in a process that can be detected electrochemically. In both cases an interface is required between the chemical or biochemical species being measured, and the electrochemical system performing the measurement. This interface is referred to as an ?electrode?. It is the transfer of electrons or ions between the electrode and the environment being sampled which is of concern in electroanalysis. The application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis is concerned with the measurement of chemical and biochemical species present in biological fluids (primarily blood but also urine and other body fluids and tissues). It is applied in several areas of critical care where its rapidity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy at biologically relevant concentrations make it an ideal choice over other, typically slower, biochemical techniques. Indeed, it is the speed of electrochemical analysis that principally differentiates it from other methods. It is not universally applicable to clinical chemistry, however, and has only been applied in situations where such analyses are relevant. This has principally been in the analysis of blood gases and pH and blood electrolytes. Electrochemical methods are, however, gradually being extended to the analysis of small biochemical components such as sugars, amino acids and other metabolites, with the advent of enzyme-based ?biosensors?. There is also little doubt that the application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis will be further exploited by the use of such biosensor devices based on other forms of biorecognition, such as antibodies, cell ligands, membranes, tissues and whole cells. These biosensor devices are also amenable to other forms of detection such as acoustic wave and optical measurements. Together, these techniques offer a wide range of advantages over traditional analytical methodologies, and will undoubtedly have a rapidly increasing impact on many types of clinical analysis. This article focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques and electrochemical biosensors and their application in clinical chemistry.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims The long-term clinical outcomes in initial survivors with acute liver failure (ALF) are not well known. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the 2-year clinical outcomes among initial survivors and liver transplant (LT) recipients that were alive 3 weeks after enrolment in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG). Methods Outcomes in adult ALFSG patients that were enrolled between 1998 and 2010 were reviewed. Results Two-year patient survival was significantly higher in the 262 LT recipients (92.4%) compared to the 306 acetaminophen (APAP) spontaneous survivors (SS) (89.5%) and 200 non-APAP SS (75.5%) (P < 0.0001). The causes of death were similar in the three groups but the time to death was significantly longer in the LT recipients (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of 2-year mortality in the APAP group were a high serum phosphate level and patient age (c-statistic = 0.65 (0.54, 0.76)), patient age and days from jaundice to ALF onset in the non-APAP group (c-statistic = 0.69 (0.60, 0.78)), and patient age, days from jaundice, and higher coma grade in the LT recipients (c-statistic = 0.74 (0.61, 0.87)). The LT recipients were significantly more likely to be employed and have a higher educational level (P < 0.05). Conclusions Two-year outcomes in initial survivors of ALF are generally good but non-APAP patients have a significantly lower survival which may relate to pre-existing medical comorbidities. Spontaneous survivors with APAP overdose experience substantial morbidity during follow-up from ongoing psychiatric and substance abuse issues.
