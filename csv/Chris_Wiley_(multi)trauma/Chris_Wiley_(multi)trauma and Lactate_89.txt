AB  - ABSTRACT. Myopathy represents one of the major features of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS). Seven patients with MSS from three different families were studied with morphological and neurophysiological methods. In two patients ragged-red fibres were found after Gomori trichrome staining. Transmission electron microscopy (EM) showed that subsarcolemmal accumulation of abnormal mitochondria regularly occurred and in one patient paracrystalline inclusion bodies were found. The EMG showed myopathic changes while the nerve condition velocities were normal. A delayed normalization of exercised-induced hyperlactatemia was noted. These findings show that mitochondrial myopathic changes are present in MSS.

AB  - Abstract The optimal staffing model during the inter-hospital transfer of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is not known. We report the complications and outcomes of patients who were commenced on ECMO at a referring hospital by intensive care physicians and compare these findings with patients who had ECMO established at an ECMO center in Australia. This was a single center, retrospective observational study based on a prospectively collected ECMO database from Melbourne, Australia. Patients with severe cardiac and/or respiratory failure failing conventional supportive treatment between 2007?2013 were placed on ECMO via a physician-led model of ECMO retrieval, including two intensivists in a four person team, using percutaneous ECMO cannulation. Patients (198) underwent ECMO over the study period, of which 31% were retrieved. Veno-venous (VV)-ECMO and veno-arterial (VA)-ECMO accounted for 27 and 73% respectively. The VA-ECMO patients had more intra-transport interventions compared with VV-ECMO transported patients, but none resulting in serious morbidity or death. There was no overall difference in survival at 6 months between retrieved and ECMO center patients: VV-ECMO (75 vs. 70%, P?=?0.690) versus VA-ECMO (70 vs. 68%, P?=?1.000). An intensive care physician-led team was able to safely place all critically ill patients on ECMO and retrieve them to an ECMO center. This may be an appropriate staffing model for ECMO retrieval.

AB  - Abstract Aim To identify additional risk factors other than asphyxia and hypothermia in newborns developing subcutaneous fat necrosis (SCFN). Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of all term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia from 2008 to 2015. The presence and location of SCFN were recorded at the time of discharge or at follow-up visits. To identify the risk factors for developing SCFN, we compared the perinatal characteristics of those newborns who developed SCFN with those who did not. Results The newborns developing SCFN had significantly higher birthweights compared with those newborns who did not develop SCFN. Among the newborns with a birthweight equal or superior to the 90th percentile, those who developed SCFN had a significantly higher use of inotropic support and higher maximum troponin levels during their initial hospitalisation. Conclusion A higher birthweight represented an independent risk factor for developing SCFN in asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia. When macrosomia is present, other risk factors related to haemodynamic instability during the initial hospitalisation may also increase the risk of developing SCFN.

AB  - Abstract Septic shock is often associated with multiorgan failure, a life threatening clinical condition during which there is an imbalance in the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, antigens, endotoxins, procoagulant, and anticoagulant factors and also resultant effects of therapeutic intervention like volume overload. Various extracorporeal therapies have shown some positive results as adjunctive therapeutic intervention to traditional antimicrobials in an effort to bring the inflammatory mediators to a homeostatic balance and to improve poor organ perfusion caused by hypotension and thrombosis in the microcirculation. This review focuses on current information on the use of therapeutic apheresis procedures as adjunctive therapy in such clinical situations as well as the exciting prospects for the near future. The sometimes disappointing results of early phase clinical studies may, in some cases, be related to the well known barriers to successful clinical trials in critically ill patients rather than to failure of the novel concept of adjunctive extracorporeal treatment of septic shock. It should be noted that some of the specialized apheresis technologies reviewed in this article are not yet available for clinical use in the United States as they are not yet approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration.

AB  - Summary Intestinal ischemia comprises a variety of disorders that develop as a result of inadequate blood supply to parts of the gastrointestinal tract. These include a broad and heterogeneous group of entities because clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and outcome of intestinal ischemia all vary as a function of the segment involved, the intensity and duration of tissue hypoxia, metabolic needs, compensatory mechanisms, and vascular lesion etiology. Acute mesenteric ischemia results from an abrupt fall in intestinal blood supply. Ischemic colitis, although it may have a similar pathophysiology or origin, is conventionally dealt with as a separate clinical entity. Intestinal rheumatoid vasculitis may present as small bowel ischemic ulcers with bleeding and infarction whereas in the colon it tends to manifest as diffuse colitis resembling chronic ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroid therapy is the standard treatment for Churg-Strauss syndrome, but may mask the clinical signs of intestinal perforation or even promote this complication.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, current treatment, and prognosis of heatstroke. Etiology: Heatstroke can be a life-threatening condition occurring because of an imbalance of heat dissipation and production. Certain factors may predispose some animals to heatstroke. The pathophysiology and sequelae of heatstroke share similarities with that of sepsis; thus, multiple organ dysfunction often ensues. The pathophysiological derangements that occur with heatstroke result from a complex series of events associated with direct cytotoxicity of heat and initiation of the acute-phase response by endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Activation of endothelial cells, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis (with ensuing microvascular thrombosis) leads to hypoxia and organ dysfunction. Heat shock proteins produced secondary to sudden heating act as protein chaperones or molecular guardians to provide protection against future heatstroke and may be implicated as a possible genetic component of heatstroke. Diagnosis: A history of recent exercise or being confined in a hot and/or humid environment, combined with clinical signs such as body temperature above 40°C (104°F), panting, tachycardia, hyperemia, dry mucous membranes, and depression to prostration is consistent with a diagnosis of heatstroke. A complete blood count performed during the initial examination of dogs with suspected heatstroke often includes nucleated red blood cells. Therapy: The mainstays for treating heatstroke include rapid evaporative cooling, volume replacement to provide cardiovascular support, and management of secondary complications. Prognosis: The prognosis is multifactorial. There is a significant negative correlation between comatose mental status, decreased temperature, and hypoglycemia with mortality.
