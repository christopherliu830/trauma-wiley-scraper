AB  - Summary This chapter deals with ?unusual? causes of ischemic stroke to highlight clues in the history, on examination and on imaging, which should serve as ?red flags? that something unusual may be underlying the patient's presenting symptoms. It divides the unusual causes of stroke into several subcategories including arterial injury; inflammatory vasculopathies and syndromes; congenital arteriopathies; hematological disorders; stroke as a result of systemic illnesses; genetic causes; and others. Cervical arterial dissections are considerably more common than intracranial dissections and their presentations are different enough that they should be considered separately. The most common vasculitis involving the brain is the temporal arteritic form of giant-cell arteritis (GCA), although it is fundamentally a systemic vasculitis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can present with focal neurologic deficits and so mimic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A stroke is deemed cryptogenic if there are no evident direct cause or high-risk features for recurrence.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic severe malarial anaemia (SMA) has a high fatality rate of 30?40%; most deaths occur in children awaiting blood transfusion. Blood transfusion services in most of Africa are not capable of delivering adequate supplies of safe blood in a timely manner to critically ill children with SMA. Contrary to widely held belief, hypovolaemia, rather than heart failure, has emerged as a common complication in such children. We examined the safety of pre-transfusion management (PTM) by volume expansion, aimed at stabilizing children and obviating the urgency for blood transfusion. Kenyan children with severe falciparum anaemia (haemoglobin?<?5?g/dl) and respiratory distress were randomly assigned to 20?ml/kg of 4·5% albumin or 0·9% saline or maintenance only (control) while awaiting blood transfusion. PTM was apparently safe since it did not lead to the development of pulmonary oedema or other adverse events. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome [mean percentage reduction in base excess between admission and 8?h (95% confidence interval)] between the control group 42% (19?66%) albumin group 44% (32?57%) and saline group 36% (16?57%); adjusted analysis of variance F?=?0·31, P?=?0·7. However, the number of children requiring emergency interventions was significantly greater in the control group, four of 18 (22%) than the saline group 0 of 20 (P?=?0·03). We have established the safety of this PTM in children with SMA whilst awaiting blood transfusion at a hospital with an adequate blood-banking program. The impact on mortality should be assessed where blood transfusion services are unable to supply emergency transfusions.

AB  - Summary This section discusses therapy for infectious diseases of the dog and cat. There are a number of infectious diseases listed in this section as chapters. These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To report on the use of 25% human serum albumin (25% HSA) (Plasbumin?), associated outcome, and efficacy in raising serum albumin and systemic blood pressure (BP) in critically ill dogs and cats. Design: Retrospective clinical study. Animals: Client-owned cats and dogs. Interventions: Administration of 25% HSA. Measurements and main results: The medical records of 66 animals (64 dogs, 2 cats) at the Ontario Veterinary College, which received 25% HSA (Plasbumin?) from June 1997 to December 2001 were reviewed for age, body weight, clinical problems, albumin and globulin (g/L) levels pre- and within 18-hour post-transfusion and upon discharge from hospital, total solids (TS), systolic and diastolic BP pre- and post-transfusion total volume administered, adverse reactions, blood products and synthetic colloids used, and outcome. Twenty-five percent HSA was prescribed for a range of clinical problems, which were grouped into 6 categories for analysis. The age range was 4 months?12 years and body weight range 1.4?65?kg. The maximum volume administered to any dog was 25?mL/kg, mean volume administered was 5?mL/kg, maximum volume given as a slow push or bolus was 4?mL/kg with a mean of 2?mL/kg volume. The range for a constant rate infusion (CRI) was 0.1?1.7?mL/kg/hr over 4?72 hours. Forty-seven (71%) animals survived to discharge; 11(16%) were euthanized, and 8 (12%) died. Serum albumin and TS increased significantly (P<0.0001) above pre-transfusion levels as did systolic BP (P<0.01). Conclusions: Twenty-five percent HSA can be safely administered to critically ill animals, and an increase in albumin levels and systemic BP can be expected.
