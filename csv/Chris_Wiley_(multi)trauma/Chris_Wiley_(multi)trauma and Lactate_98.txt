AB  - Nutrition support is recognized as an important cofactor in altering morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. Paramount in delivering proper nutrition support is the accurate determination of baseline metabolic and nutritional status, thus influencing necessary protein requirements. After nutritional intervention, routine laboratory monitoring is used to measure the efficacy and to reassess metabolic stress level. Accurate determination of nitrogen excretion (and nitrogen balance) remains the standard in prescribing and monitoring the protein and nutritional treatment regimen. This article examines nitrogen excretion determinations in the clinical setting, including proper collection techniques, laboratory measurements, and analyses and their effect upon nitrogen balance studies.

AB  - Abstract Tools designed to electrically induce fish immobilization are increasingly being implemented by practitioners for safe and effective fish handling. Currently used methods for electro-immobilizing batches of fish incorporate a period of hyperactivity that serves to reduce spinal injuries in fish. However, like the hyperactive period that is seen in other fish immobilization techniques, it provides a visually unappealing effect and introduces questions surrounding humane animal treatment. In this study, three different electro-immobilization treatments were evaluated for rates and severity of injury as well as time to immobilization to determine ways of reducing the hyperactive period while also maintaining low rates of injury. Tests were conducted in a Smith-Root EA-1000B System on adult summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss at the Cowlitz Salmon Hatchery (Salkum, Washington). Treatments included an electrical output setting commonly used at the facility, two experimental electrical outputs, and a chemical anesthetic (MS-222) treatment that served as a control. Efficacy, indicated as time to immobilization, was evaluated among electrical output treatments; humane fish treatment, measured by hemorrhage, spinal injuries, and mortality, was quantified and compared among all treatments. Analysis of variance indicated a significant difference in induction times among electrical treatment groups, which ranged from 14.2 ± 4.9 to 53.4 ± 2.6 s (mean ± 95% CI). Some spinal and hemorrhage injuries were observed in all treatment groups; however, only one electrical treatment had significantly higher (P = 0.003) incidence and severity of injuries compared to the control. Results indicate that hatchery managers can significantly reduce the time needed to immobilize fish while maintaining minimal fish injury rates when using a commercial electro-immobilization system.

AB  - Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of microglia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of depression. Activated microglia produce a wide range of factors whose prolonged or excessive release may lead to brain disorders. Thus, the inhibition of microglial cells may be beneficial in the treatment of depressive diseases. Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant drug with proven clinical efficacy, but its mechanism of action remains still not fully understood. In the present study, using microglial cultures we investigated whether tianeptine modifies microglial activation after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and which intracellular pathways are involved in the activity of this antidepressant. Our study shows that tianeptine attenuated the LPS-evoked inflammatory activation of microglia by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1?, IL-18, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), the release of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Analyses of signaling pathways demonstrate that tianeptine led to the suppression of LPS-induced TLR4 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, our study reveals the inhibitory impact of tianeptine on caspase-3-induced PKCδ degradation and consequently on the activation of NF-?B factor in microglial cells. Taken together, present results show anti-inflammatory properties of tianeptine in microglial cultures stimulated by LPS. This study provides evidence that the inhibition of microglial activation may underlie the therapeutic activity of tianeptine. Our findings show the anti-inflammatory effect of tianeptine (TIA) in lipopolisaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. The beneficial tianeptine action is mediated through the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression as well as the TLR4-related pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), caspase-3-dependent protein kinase δ (PKCδ) cleavage and the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B). These findings may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of disorders based on neuroinflammation, including depression.

AB  - Abstract Information given in previous Opinions ?Welfare of cattle kept for beef production? (SCAHAW, 2001) and ?The risks of poor welfare in intensive calf farming systems? (EFSA, 2006) is updated and recent scientific evidence on the topics reviewed. Risks of poor welfare are identified using a structured analysis, and issues not identified in the SCAHAW (2001) beef Opinion, especially effects of housing and management on enteric and respiratory diseases are reviewed. The Opinion covers all systems of beef production, although the welfare of suckler cows or breeding bulls is not considered. The Chapter on beef cattle presents new evidence and recommendations in relation to heat and cold stress, mutilations and pain management, digestive disorders linked to high concentrate feeds and respiratory disorders linked to overstocking, inadequate ventilation, mixing of animals and failure of early diagnosis and treatment. Major welfare problems in cattle kept for beef production, as identified by risk assessment, were respiratory diseases linked to overstocking, inadequate ventilation, mixing of animals and failure of early diagnosis and treatment, digestive disorders linked to intensive concentrate feeding, lack of physically effective fibre in the diet, and behavioural disorders linked to inadequate floor space, and co-mingling in the feedlot. Major hazards for white veal calves were considered to be iron-deficiency anaemia, a direct consequence of dietary iron restriction, enteric diseases linked to high intakes of liquid feed and inadequate intake of physically effective fibre, discomfort and behavioural disorders linked to inadequate floors and floor space.

AB  - Abstract Macrophages are ubiquitous in the stromal compartment of tissues under normal physiological conditions and the number of these cells increases markedly with the onset and progression of many pathological states. The mechanisms underlying this response are well described in such conditions as wound healing and malignant tumors, where tissue-specific signals enhance the extravasation of blood monocytes and their subsequent differentiation into macrophages. Recent evidence suggests that macrophages may also be stimulated by microenvironmental factors present in diseased tissues to perform distinct, tissue-specific activities. One such factor, hypoxia (low oxygen tension), results from insufficient vascular perfusion of a given tissue. Various studies have shown that experimental hypoxia alters the morphology, expression of cell surface markers, viability, phagocytosis, metabolic activity, and release of cytokines by macrophages. Here we review the evidence for these macrophage responses to hypoxia, the involvement of co-stimuli, and their implications for the role of macrophages in various disease processes. Because the intracellular mechanisms mediating the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in other cell types have been characterized recently, we discuss their possible involvement in the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in macrophages.
