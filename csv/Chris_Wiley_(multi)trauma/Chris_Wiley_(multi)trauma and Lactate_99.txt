AB  - ABSTRACT Biological psychiatry has four principal modes of investigation but each has been flawed by errors in procedure and inference such that the bulk of existing findings must be called into question. Pedigree studies are ruined by selective adoption, the use of ?throw-away kids? to demonstrate so-called genetic effects, lack of case history data, and lapses in ?blind? diagnosis. In particular, the Danish adoption studies are challenged, despite the field's insistence that this research has settled the nature-nurture controversy in schizophrenia. Pharmacological-response studies are the next line of methodology and these are marred by a spurious assumption that drugs which work must be correcting a biochemical imbalance that causes the condition. Thirdly, neuropsychological-neurophysiological studies are ?heuristic? fishing-expeditions to find a presumed abnormality to account for psychopathology, without doing the prospective longitudinal research necessary to validate such theory. Lastly, biochemical correlates of emotion are treated as if each emotion must have a distinct neuronal substrate rather than possibly representing a general visceral arousal where cognition defines the feeling. All told, biological psychiatry is often more reductionist than acknowledged, does not come up to current scientific standards, and uncritically cites work which is, or should be, discredited. At the heart of the problem is an implicit ideology within biological psychiatry, with insufficient awareness of its social ramifications: ?blaming the victim's body? protects the status quo by holding protoplasm at fault for maladjustment rather than the person, family, or community.

AB  - Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alters both specific and nonspecific immune functions, resulting in immunosuppression. Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to improve the adaptive responses of the gut after surgery. The following study investigates the effects of adding short-chain fatty acids to TPN on the immune system after an 80% small bowel resection. Methods: Rats (237 ± 3 g) were infused with either TPN (n = 25) or TPN supplemented with short-chain fatty acids (n = 26) for 3 or 7 days. Hematologic analysis was performed on peripheral blood and splenocytes were isolated to characterize cell phenotypes, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and to estimate proliferative response. Results: The relative percent of T (CD3+) cells increased (p <.05) and the relative percent of macrophages decreased (p <.001, n = 13) in the spleens of the 3-day TPN-fed rats. By day 7, these differences disappeared. The natural killer cells from rats that were supplemented with short-chain fatty acids had higher (p <.0001) cytotoxic activity than the TPN groups at day 3. Mitogenic response did not differ between groups but were depressed compared with sham-treated rats. By day 7, rats on standard TPN had larger (p <.0001) spleens than all other groups. This group also had a higher total white blood cell count because of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (p <.02). Conclusion: Short-chain fatty acids improve components of nonspecific immune responses and may be beneficial in reducing certain aspects of TPNassociated immunosuppression after major surgery.

AB  - Summary The anesthesia of caged of birds is unique not only from the aspect of anatomy and physiology, but also due to unique requirements for anesthetic equipment, monitoring, and species-specific pharmacology. The medical history and husbandry of the pet bird is essential for preanesthetic evaluation. Body temperature is monitored continuously throughout anesthesia. Appropriate means of physical restraint must be assessed for each patient and appropriate stabilization and supportive care prepared prior to handling. Sedatives and tranquilizers are used to decrease anxiety and fear during induction. However, most tranquilizers lack analgesia. Injectable anesthetics are more commonly used in the field due to the ease of transport compared with inhalant anesthetic delivery equipment. Birds may be more sensitive to the toxic effects of local anesthetics than mammals. Due to the rapid rate at which birds may decompensate under anesthesia, monitoring is the most important aspect of avian anesthesia body weight.

We describe a heart transplant patient who presented with a large right-sided chest wall mass as a manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis. A successful clinical outcome was achieved upon recognition of the fungal pathogen.

AB  - BACKGROUND Clinical trials have shown that longer red blood cell (RBC) storage duration does not worsen outcomes; however, these studies included few RBCs near the end of the 42-day storage limit. We tested the hypothesis that these ?oldest? RBCs are associated with adverse outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In a retrospective study, 28,247 transfused patients given 129,483 RBC units were assessed. Morbidity, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were compared in patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored not more than 21 days versus patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 28 days or more and patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 35 days or more. RESULTS After risk adjustment, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.32; p = 0.002), but ≥28-day RBCs were not (adjOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97-1.15; p = 0.2). Neither ≥35-day nor ≥28-day RBCs were associated with increased mortality. In critically ill patients, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44; p = 0.002) and mortality (adjOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.74; p = 0.009), but ≥28-day RBCs were associated with neither. In older patients, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42; p = 0.01), but not mortality (adjOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96-1.71; p = 0.1), and ≥28-day RBCs were associated with neither. LOS was increased for both ≥28- and ≥35-day RBCs for all patients and the critically ill and older subgroups. CONCLUSIONS RBCs transfused in the last 7 days of their 42-day storage limit may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in high-risk patients.
