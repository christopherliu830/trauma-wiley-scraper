AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Background Many authors advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis of pancreatitis and a cut-off level of three or more times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is often quoted. The literature contains no systematic review that explores alternative causes of a lipase level over three times as high as the ULN. Such a review was therefore the objective of this study. Methods The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1985 to August 2013) were searched for all eligible articles. Predetermined data were extracted and independently analysed by two reviewers. Results In total, data from 58 studies were included in the final analysis. The following causes other than pancreatitis of lipase levels exceeding three times the ULN were found: reduced clearance of lipase caused by renal impairment or macrolipase formation; other hepatobiliary, gastroduodenal, intestinal and neoplastic causes; critical illness, including neurosurgical pathology; alternative pancreatic diagnoses, such as non-pathological pancreatic hyperenzymaemia, and miscellaneous causes such as diabetes, drugs and infections. Conclusions A series of differential diagnoses for significant serum lipase elevations (i.e. exceeding three times the ULN) has been provided by this study. Clinicians should utilize this knowledge in the interpretation and management of patients who have lipase levels over three times as high as the ULN, remaining vigilant for an alternative diagnosis to pancreatitis. The medical officer should be aware of the possibility of incorrect diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to determine if hospital admission of children with blunt abdominal trauma for observation of possible intraabdominal injury (IAI) is necessary after a normal abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Methods:? The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of children less than 18?years of age with blunt abdominal trauma who underwent an abdominal CT scan in the ED. Abdominal CT scans were obtained with intravenous contrast but no oral contrast. The decision to hospitalize the patient was made by the attending emergency physician (EP) with the trauma or pediatric surgery teams. An abnormal abdominal CT scan was defined by the presence of any visualized IAI or findings suggestive of possible IAI (e.g., intraperitoneal fluid without solid organ injury). Patients were followed to determine if IAI was later diagnosed and the need for acute therapeutic intervention if IAI was present. Results:? A total of 1,295 patients underwent abdominal CT, and 1,085 (84%) patients had normal abdominal CT scans in the ED and make up the study population. Seven-hundred thirty-seven (68%) were hospitalized, and 348 were discharged to home. None of the 348 patients discharged home and 2 of the 737 hospitalized patients were identified with an IAI after a normal initial abdominal CT. The IAIs in patients with normal initial CT scans included a 10-year-old with a mesenteric hematoma and serosal tear at laparotomy and a 10-year-old with a perinephric hematoma on repeat CT. Neither underwent specific therapy. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a normal abdominal CT scan for IAI was 99.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?99.3% to 100%). Conclusions:? Children with blunt abdominal trauma and a normal abdominal CT scan in the ED are at very low risk of having a subsequently diagnosed IAI and are very unlikely to require a therapeutic intervention. Hospitalization of children for evaluation of possible undiagnosed IAI after a normal abdominal CT scan has a low yield and is generally unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Purpose: All cardiothoracic consultations initiated at Accident and Emergency Department for period February 1995 to November 2000 were reviewed. Methods: Information was extracted from Trauma Registry of over 1000 cases. Results: 61 consultation was recorded. There were 33 blunt injury and 28 penetrating injury. 21 cases were of ISS 15 or less. Surgery for thoracic injury was performed in 13 cases of blunt injury (40%) and 20 cases of penetrating injury (70%). Majority of surgery was related to chest wall and lung injury. In addition there were 3 major intrathoracic vessel, 6 cardiac, 3 diaphragmatic and 1 major airway injury. 20 deaths were recorded with 4 deaths at A&E department. Mortality is related to severity of ISS and age >70. 4 ER-thoracotomy was performed with 3 deaths. There were related to heart and aorta injury with average ISS≥50. Conclusion: 1. Major cardiothoracic trauma is not common. 2. When present, it is associated with severe injury. 3. The outcome is related to severity of ISS and old age.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of the present study was to report the clinicopathologic, radiographic and immunohistochemical features of five South American cases of intraosseous xanthomas of the mandible and to compare them to those detected in a literature review. Methods Clinical data were collected from the records of three Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology services in South America and compared with those compiled from a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus). All cases were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD68 and S-100. Results The series comprised four females (80%) and one male (20%) with a mean age of 23.3 ± 10.9 years (range: 13-45 years). In four cases, there was involvement of the posterior region of the mandible (80%). The lesions presented radiographically as unilocular (60%) radiolucencies with punched-out margin (80%). All cases predominantly consisted of CD68-positive and S-100-negative xanthomatous cells. No recurrences were observed after curettage, with a median follow-up of 27 months. Conclusion Intraosseous xanthoma of the jaws is a rare benign disorder. We report here five additional cases affecting the mandible, for a total of 36 cases of the jaws reported in the literature. Overall, this lesion has predilection for posterior sites of the mandible of asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and etiology of acute pancreatitis at a major pediatric referral center in Australia. Methods:? A 10-year retrospective audit was conducted at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. All patients from 1993 and 2002 with a serum lipase level greater than three times the upper reference range and a history consistent with acute pancreatitis were included. Results:? During the 10-year period, 279 confirmed cases of acute pancreatitis were identified. The median age at presentation was 10?years (range, 0.2?15.9). In 209 (74.9%) patients, a likely cause of acute pancreatitis was found, including trauma (36.3%), systemic disease (22.2%), metabolic (5.8%), biliary (5.4%), drugs (3.2%), or viral illness (2.2%). In the remaining 70 (25.1%) cases, the pancreatitis was deemed idiopathic. Comparing data from 1993 to 1997 with data from 1998?2002, there was a significant increase in the annual incidence of pancreatitis (24.6?±?2.3 vs 31.2?±?6 cases per year; P?=?0.04). A linear regression analysis showed a strong association between the incidence and the year of diagnosis (r2?=?0.5775, P?=?0.01). This increase was mainly due to a significant rise in idiopathic disease (r2?=?0.83, P?=?0.0002) and systemic disease (r2?=?0.41, P?=?0.048), whereas the incidence of other causes of acute pancreatitis remained unchanged. Conclusion:? The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children has increased significantly over the past decade. The increase was greatest in children with idiopathic pancreatitis. It remains unclear whether this reflects a true incidence increase or improved clinical awareness.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare age, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, outcome, treatment and clinical response between cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease with normal or increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations. Methods: Medical records for 23 cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations available were reviewed. Three groups were compared; cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations 2·0 to 6·8 µg/l (group A), 6·9 to 11·9 µg/l (group B) and ≥12·0 µg/l (group C). Results: Sixteen of the 23 cats had increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations; 9 cats in group B and 7 cats in group C. The remaining seven cats were in group A. Cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l had significantly lower median serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations. No significant differences were identified between the three groups for age, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, clinical outcome, treatment or clinical response. Clinical Significance: Hypoalbuminaemia and hypocobalaminaemia were more frequently observed in cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - The endogenous cannabinoid signalling system, composed of endogenous cannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors and the enzymes that synthesize and degrade the endogenous cannabinoids, is much more complex than initially conceptualized. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid and plays a major role in CNS development and synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, many key players in 2-AG synthesis and degradation have been identified and characterized. Most 2-AG is synthesized from membrane phospholipids via sequential activation of a phospholipase C? and a diacylglycerol lipase, although other pathways may contribute in specialized settings. 2-AG breakdown is more complicated with at least eight different enzymes participating. These enzymes can either degrade 2-AG into its components, arachidonic acid and glycerol, or transform 2-AG into highly bioactive signal molecules. The implications of the precise temporal and spatial control of the expression and function of these pleiotropic metabolizing enzymes have only recently come to be appreciated. In this review, we will focus on the primary organization of the synthetic and degradative pathways of 2-AG and then discuss more recent findings and their implications, with an eye towards the biological and therapeutic implications of manipulating 2-AG synthesis and metabolism.
