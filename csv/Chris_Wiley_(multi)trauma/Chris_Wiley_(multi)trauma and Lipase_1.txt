AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents information on etiology/pathophysiology, signalment/history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnostics and therapeutics of feline pancreatitis in cats and dogs. Local and systemic tissue injury is due to the activity of released pancreatic enzymes and a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins, free radicals, and complement factors, released by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The most common pathologies involving the feline pancreas include acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and acute suppurative pancreatitis. Etiology is most often unknown. Serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPL) is a highly sensitive and specific serologic marker of acute pancreatic inflammation. fPL assay and pancreatic ultrasound in combination have the highest specificity for an antemortem diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy may confirm inflammation (cytology), abscess, or cygst.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Thrombosis of the pancreas after transplantation is the most common cause of relaparotomy and resultant graft loss. There is currently no standard protocol consistently proven to prevent thrombosis following transplantation. Our objective was to determine whether our protocol of post-operative low-dose intravenous (IV) heparin infusion would prevent graft thrombosis without additional complications in our patients. Methods A total of 66 simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplants were performed at our institution from 2004 to 2014. Patients were divided into 2 retrospective cohort groups. Group 1 patients received only acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg/d started on post-operative day 1. Group 2 patients received IV heparin infusion beginning in the recovery room at a rate of 500 IU/h for the first 24 hours, reduced by 100 IU/h every day to stop on day 5, and then received ASA 81 mg/d afterward. Outcome and complication rates were compared between the two groups for 5 years post-transplant. Results We observed a significant reduction in graft thrombosis and graft loss with (0/29) patients in the heparin group vs (7/33) 25.7% from the non-heparin (P<.01) with no differences in complication rates. Conclusions We present a heparin infusion protocol which may help prevent graft thrombosis and graft loss in SPK transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endocannabinoids have both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties against harmful stimuli. We previously demonstrated that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) protects hippocampal neurons by limiting the inflammatory response via a CB1 receptor-dependent MAPK/NF-?B signalling pathway. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PPAR?, an important nuclear receptor, mediates 2-AG-induced inhibition of NF-?B phosphorylation and COX-2 expression, and COX-2-enhanced miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH By using a whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recording technique and immunoblot analysis, we determined mEPSCs, expression of COX-2 and PPAR?, and phosphorylation of NF-kB in mouse hippocampal neurons in culture. KEY RESULTS Exogenous and endogenous 2-AG-produced suppressions of NF-?B-p65 phosphorylation, COX-2 expression and excitatory synaptic transmission in response to pro-inflammatory interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and LPS were inhibited by GW9662, a selective PPAR? antagonist, in hippocampal neurons in culture. PPAR? agonists 15-deoxy-?12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and rosiglitazone mimicked the effects of 2-AG on NF-?B-p65 phosphorylation, COX-2 expression and mEPSCs, and these effects were eliminated by antagonism of PPAR?. Moreover, exogenous application of 2-AG or elevation of endogenous 2-AG by inhibiting its hydrolysis with URB602 or JZL184, selective inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), prevented the IL-1?- and LPS-induced reduction of PPAR? expression. The 2-AG restoration of the reduced PPAR? expression was blocked or attenuated by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the CB1 receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our results suggest that CB1 receptor-dependent PPAR? expression is an important and novel signalling pathway in endocannabinoid 2-AG-produced resolution of neuroinflammation in response to pro-inflammatory insults.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of pancreatitis in patients treated with pegaspargase in our hospital during a 2-year period. Procedure We identified episodes of pancreatitis related to the intramuscular administration of pegaspargase 2,500 IU/m2 for the treatment of childhood hematological malignancies during a 2-year period (May 1996?April 1998). Patients were evaluated clinically and by sequential serum amylase and lipase determinations and radiographic examinations. For comparison, episodes of pancreatitis in patients who only received native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase were examined during the same time period. Results Nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of 50 (18%) patients who received pegaspargase were diagnosed to have pancreatitis. All had prior therapy with native L-asparaginase. These children developed symptoms consisting of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite within a median of 15 days from the onset of pegaspargase administration. Six patients became symptomatic after their initial dose. Seven patients developed severe or unacceptable toxicity (grades 3 and 4), measured by increased amylase (>2 times normal) and lipase levels or radiographic evidence of pancreatic inflammation or pseudocyst. One patient also developed hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. In contrast, only one out of 52 (1.9%) ALL patients who received native E. coli L-asparaginase during the same time period developed pancreatitis (P= 0.007). Conclusion Clinicians should be aware of a possible higher incidence of pancreatitis associated with pegaspargase. Med Pediatr Oncol 34:200?205, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Although hyperamylasemia has been reported in a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), its clinical significance as well as the pathogenic mechanism remain poorly understood. Apart from pancreatic cellular injury, impaired renal function or hypercalcemia after CPB was also proposed to play a possible role in the etiology of postoperative hyperamylasemia. The study was designed to investigate whether avoidance of CPB would limit amylase elevation. Methods: Serum levels of amylase and lipase were measured before operation, 24 and 48 hours after surgery in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without the use of CPB over a 10-month period. The choice of procedure was based mainly on the native coronary anatomy and left ventricular function. Postoperative complications as well as the plasma levels of creatinine and calcium were also carefully monitored. Results: Three surgical approaches were used for CABG: CPB (conventional on-pump through median sternotomy, n = 32), OPCAB (off-pump through median sternotomy, n = 14), and MIDCAB (off-pump through left minithoracotomy, n = 12). There was no hospital mortality. No patient had postoperative abdominal complications. Transient hyperamylasemia occurred in 14 patients, 7 in the CPB group (22%), 5 in the OPCAB group (36%), and 2 in the MIDCAB group (17%). The increase in amylase levels was similar among groups. However, no lipase elevation was detected in any patient. There was no clear correlation between hyperamylasemia and an increased creatinine level. Perioperative plasma calcium levels were normal in patients who had hyperamylasemia. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the incidence of hyperamylasemia among patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with or without the use of CPB and irrespective of mode of surgical access. Hence, CPB is not the major factor responsible for hyperamylasemia, as previously believed.

AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.

AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

AB  - While ex situ conservation programs of juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758), before release to natural habitats, have been conducted in several countries, the optimal-stocking density for husbandry has not yet been reported. The optimization of stocking density was the main purpose of this study. The 15-day-old post-hatching turtles (29.30?±?0.05?g body weight) were reared in round fiberglass tanks at various stocking densities including 20 turtles/m3 (20TM), 40 turtles/m3 (40TM), 60 turtles/m3 (60TM), and 80 turtles/m3 (80TM), over an 8-week trial. Water quality, survival, growth performance, feed utilization, aggressive behavior, fecal digestive enzymes, and hematological parameters were compared between the treatments, and were used as indicators of a successful captive rearing program. The water quality across the four treatments was in the standard range, but a high-stocking density reduced the quality significantly. No mortality was observed in any treatment group. Superior growth and feed utilization were only observed with the 40TM treatment, relative to the others (P?<?0.05). The turtles in this group had no aggressive behavior, as indicated by observing hind limb biting. This treatment manipulated the level of proteolytic activity of pepsin and trypsin in response to density stressor, but not amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsin. The 40TM treatment also maintained the hematological characteristics, indicating no negative effects on health status. Overall, the findings indicate that the captivity program of post-hatching turtles at 40 turtles/m3 is the preferred option in their head-started propagation, as well as in public displays in zoos or aquaria.
