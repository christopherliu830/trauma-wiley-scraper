AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare but important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity. Predicting the severity and outcome of AP in pediatric patients can be challenging because there are few validated severity scoring systems. Moreover, the etiology of pediatric AP in the Japanese population is different from that of Western populations. The performance of severity scores in pediatric AP with a high prevalence of severe cases is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of existing severity scoring systems when used for Japanese children at a tertiary care center. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of all children (≤18?years) treated for AP at between 2002 and 2012 at National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo. The modified Glasgow acute pancreatitis severity score (modified Glasgow), Ranson criteria (Ranson), Balthazar computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and pediatric acute pancreatitis severity (PAPS) score were assessed for their ability to distinguish severe pancreatitis from the milder forms. Results Thirty-three Japanese children with AP were identified. Among them, 37 episodes were analyzed for the performance of the scoring systems and 33 for the etiology. The most common etiology of AP was structural abnormality (n = 8). Sensitivity for the modified Glasgow, Ranson, PAPS, and CTSI was 42.9%, 52.4%, 81.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, while specificity was 81.3%, 81.3%, 37.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Conclusion We found PAPS to be the most reliable when used for discriminating the severe form of AP from the milder forms at a Japanese tertiary pediatric care center.

AB  - 1 Fresh rat aortic rings were incubated in HEPES-buffered salt solutions. Extracellular Ca2+ stimulated the production of prostacyclin (PGI2), as determined by radioimmunoassay of its stable hydrolysis product 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1α. This action of Ca2+ was modified by H+ over the pH range 8.0?6.5. Stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187 was not pH-dependent. 2 In parallel incubations of aortic rings with 45 Ca2+, followed by washing in the presence of La3+, tissue uptake of 45Ca2+ increased progressively as extracellular pH was increased from 6.5?8.0. Over this range intracellular pH, estimated by the distribution of [14C]-dimethadione, varied from 5.9-7.4. 3 Stimulation by Ca2+ of PGI2 synthesis was concentration-dependent over the range 0.7?20 mm. The maximum effect was an increase of approx. 4 fold. 4 Nifedipine, but not verapamil or diltiazem, inhibited Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis. A dihydropyridine compound that activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Bay K 8644, did not increase PGI2 synthesis. 5 8-(N, N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5 timethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), an antagonist of intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation, inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis to a similar extent. 6 A solution containing 40 mm K+ reduced Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 production. Mg2+ stimulated PGI2 synthesis in a pH-dependent manner but was less potent than Ca2+. Other divalent cations (Mn2+, Ba2+ and Sr2+), and La3+ had little or no effect on basal or Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis.

AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) represent a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive rapidly progressive necrosis that may involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia or muscle. Their progress is extremely fast, leading often to sepsis and septic shock that ends up in multiple organ failure with abrupt and high mortality. A variety of classification systems have been developed based on parameters such as anatomic location of the disease or microbiology. There are a number of factors that predispose to the spread of these soft tissue infections, such as delays in recognition, immune suppression, diabetes mellitus and advanced age. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics tends to mask the severity of the underlying infection, modulates the clinical presentation, and even delays hospital admission. The most important factor affecting outcome in NSTI is early diagnosis and aggressive radical surgical treatment. The medical records of 13 patients who had been treated for NSTI from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed, retrospectively. There were eight men (61.5%) and five (38.5%) women. Mean age was 56?years (range 27?73). Seven cases of infection involved the perineal region (54%), two the lower limb, one the upper limb and three the abdominal wall/trunk. The most common associated comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in five patients (38.5%). A single organism was identified in two (15%) and multiple organisms in 11 (85%) patients. Necrotizing aponeurositis Type I was the most common of the polymicrobial necrotizing infections. Overall survival was 85%, and the mean hospital stay for survivors was 35 days (range 17?92).
