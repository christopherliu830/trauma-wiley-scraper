AB  - Heparins are a heterogenous group of naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans characterized by anticoagulant activity and a wide range of molecular weights (low molecular weight or fractionated heparins evolving within the past two decades). Cofactors for endogenous inhibitors of coagulation (antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II), heparin administration results in a hypocoagulable state. Various platelet activities, including inhibition of activity induced by platelet-derived growth factors on vascular smooth muscle, also have been noted. Divorced of anticoagulant nature, novel applications may include a role in atherosclerosis prevention, acceleration of collateral coronary as well as peripheral circulation (i.e., angiogenesis), and continued (chronic) post-myocardial infarction therapy. Established indications include treatment of various thrombotic diseases, unstable angina, and thrombosis chemoprophylaxis in medical/surgical patients. The antithrombotic potential of the heparins is used also in thrombosis management related to extracorporeal circulatory assistance or dialysis devices. Heparin's therapeutic potential in the postphlebitic syndrome as well as in acute treatment of myocardial infarction (primarily and adjunctively with various thrombolytic agents) continues to undergo evaluation; however, early data review shows favorable trends for its inclusion in situations that favor thrombus generation (e.g., anterior myocardial infarction). Although associated with thrombocytopenia or hypertransaminasemia, the heparins are relatively well tolerated. In a small subset of patients, a severe thrombocytopenia may ensue, which generally resolves on medication withdrawal. As this class of glycosaminoglycans becomes better characterized, new indications may emerge for both native and the newer fractionated heparins.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the biomedical applications of nanocelluloses including drug delivery systems, tissue engineering materials, and other nanocellulose-based biomaterials. It also discusses the toxicity of nanocellulose and the interactions of nanocellulose with biomacromolecules or cells. Bioinspired composite systems with molecular-scale interactions can be tailor made, with specific functionalities, coupled with nontoxicity, and cellulose can be used in cell imaging. Nanocellulose has an important application value in biological macromolecule and cell levels. Based on these studies, some researchers have promoted the research fields of nanocellulose and organism to the organization levels and explored the potential values of nanocellulose in tissue repair and tissue replacement. Nanocellulose and its biocomposites have been proved to be promising scaffolds for the culture of various cells, including osteoblast and chondroblast, which indicates that nanocellulose-based materials have the potential for bone tissue regeneration and healing.

AB  - Abstract:? Two distinct approaches are being explored in red blood cell substitute (RCS) development: hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs). HBOCs are based on intra- and/or intermolecularly ?engineered? human or animal hemoglobins (Hbs), optimized for O2 delivery and longer intravascular circulation. Some are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical studies. PFBOCs are aqueous emulsions of perfluorocarbon derivatives that dissolve relatively large amounts of O2. A PFBOC based on a 60% (wt/vol) emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide has been evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials. Although current PFBOC products generally require patients to breathe O2 enriched air, they render certain advantages since they are totally synthetic. This article provides a short review of the basic principles, approaches, and current status of RCS development. Results of preclinical and clinical studies including recent Phase II/III clinical studies are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a major problem of health in developed countries, with important consequences in disability and health economics. Recent findings in CNS genomics and pharmacogenomics suggest that the introduction of pharmacogenomic procedures in clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics (efficacy and safety issues). The genes involved in the pharmacogenomics of CNS drugs fall into five categories: (i) genes associated with CNS pathogenesis; (ii) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (iii) genes associated with drug metabolism; (iv) genes associated with drug transporters; and (v) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 30?90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Only 20?30% of the Caucasian population processes normally approximately 60% of the current drugs that are metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Clinical pharmacogenomics may contribute to personalizing pharmacological treatment, predicting patient/drug-dose selection, minimizing drug interactions, increasing drug efficacy, and reducing unnecessary costs.
