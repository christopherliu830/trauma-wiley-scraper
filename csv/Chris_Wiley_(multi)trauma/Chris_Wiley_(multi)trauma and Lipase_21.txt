AB  - Abstract To date, almost 2600 gene therapy clinical trials have been completed, are ongoing or have been approved worldwide. Our database brings together global information on gene therapy clinical activity from trial databases, official agency sources, published literature, conference presentations and posters kindly provided to us by individual investigators or trial sponsors. This review presents our analysis of clinical trials that, to the best of our knowledge, have been or are being performed worldwide. As of our November 2017 update, we have entries on 2597 trials undertaken in 38 countries. We have analysed the geographical distribution of trials, the disease indications (or other reasons) for trials, the proportions to which different vector types are used, and the genes that have been transferred. Details of the analyses presented, and our searchable database are available via The Journal of Gene Medicine Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide website at: http://www.wiley.co.uk/genmed/clinical. We also provide an overview of the progress being made in gene therapy clinical trials around the world, and discuss key trends since the previous review, namely the use of chimeric antigen receptor T cells for the treatment of cancer and advancements in genome editing technologies, which have the potential to transform the field moving forward.

AB  - Dementia is a major health problem in developed countries with over 25 million people affected worldwide and probably over 75 million people at risk during the next 20?years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia (50?70%), followed by vascular dementia (30?40%), and mixed dementia (15?20%). AD pathogenesis is still to be elucidated but it is believed to be the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors in later life. Three causative genes for familial AD have been identified: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and presenilin-2. There are 150 genes involved with increased neuronal vulnerability to premature death in the AD brain. Among these susceptibility genes, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is the most prevalent as a risk for AD pathogenic process in which complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are involved, leading to a cascade of pathogenic events converging in final pathways to premature neuronal death. Some of these mechanisms are common to several neurodegenerative disorders that differ depending upon the genes affected and the involvement of environmental conditions. ApoE is a key lipoprotein in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and it is also the major risk gene for AD and many other central nervous system disorders. The pathogenic role of ApoE-4 is still to be clarified; however, diverse evidence suggests that ApoE may play pleiotropic functions in dementia and central nervous system disorders.

AB  - Abstract Multimodality therapies that include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and various newer forms of targeted therapies have been commonly applied in childhood cancers. Such modalities are associated with complications that may adversely affect the outcome of cancer treatment. Acute complications that require surgical management form the focus of our discussion. These patients are often compromised by immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and malnutrition. The complications discussed include typhlitis, invasive aspergillosis (IA), pancreatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, necrotizing skin and soft-tissue infections, and perianal infection. Familiarity with the spectrum of complications and their appropriate management approaches will minimize the patients' morbidity. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012;59:405?409. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) remains poorly understood. Recently, molecular biology has identified the genetic background for many patients with hereditary CP. In addition, a number of studies have focused on the detection of proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor gene mutations in the pathogenesis of CP. So far, the use of these mutations (with the exception of mutations causing hereditary CP), as diagnostic and prognostic markers is still controversial. Discussion It is well known that the risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with CP, especially the hereditary form, is high. At present, there is insufficient evidence to show a clear relationship between the development of pancreatic cancer and certain mutations. New biotechnological methods, such as DNA array expression analysis, expand our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and may help to develop specific diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. However, until long-term studies examine the safety and efficacy of certain genetic markers, long-term follow-up of patients with CP who harbour mutations is needed.
