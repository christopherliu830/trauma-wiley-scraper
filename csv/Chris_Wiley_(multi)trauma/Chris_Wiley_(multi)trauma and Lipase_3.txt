AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract Background. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is detrimental for the recovery of organ function in trauma and emergency patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the dynamics of IAP and organ dysfunction in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Materials and methods. Management of SAP between 2000 and 2004 was analysed. SAP was classified according to Atlanta 1992. Organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and outcomes in relation to the IAP were assessed. IAP was measured indirectly. Results. A total of 65 patients, with an average APACHE II score of 6.44, complied with the Atlanta criteria. In all, 34 patients received conservative treatment and 31 were operated. SIRS was observed in 59 cases and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 61 cases. IAP was significantly higher in the 25 most complicated patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), compared with 40 patients without RRT, 31.72 vs 21.4 cm/H2O (p=0.037). IAP interrelated positively with SOFA score (r =+ 0.371, p<0.01) and organs involved (r =+ 0.356, p<0.01), and negatively with platelet count and enterally provided volume (r =? 0.284, p<0.01; r =? 0.5, p<0.01, respectively). Overall mortality (9.2%) was associated with surgery and sustained increase of the IAP over 25 cm/H2O. Our data support the pathophysiological interrelation of elevated IAP and development of organ dysfunction. Conclusion. Development of organ dysfunction in SAP could be associated with increased IAP. Grade III increase of IAP should be considered as an indicator for revision of treatment modalities.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Summary Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for most other geriatric emergencies. Deranged glycaemic control may be the first indication of an infection or other acute illness. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases with age, and symptoms may be atypical. Long-acting insulin or oral sulphonylureas can cause persistent hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome is associated with potentially lethal dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Complications include infection and thrombosis. Older patients are prone to disorders of thermoregulation due to extreme environmental conditions, medical conditions or medication. Hypothermia can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Heat illness is less common in temperate climates but older patients are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves and as a result of sun-exposure.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MM) is a new generation immunosuppressant, which has been successfully used for treatment of renal, heart and liver transplants, and other immune-mediated diseases. MM is also a safe and steroid-sparing agent for treating neuromuscular diseases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myastenia gravis. MM is an ester of mycophenolic acid, an agent that inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Side effects are modest and there is a lower risk for late malignancies than other immunosuppressive drugs. We assessed MM in the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The therapy of MMN largely depends upon the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg induce and maintain improvement in MMN, but they do not eradicate the disease and are very expensive. No randomized controlled trials are available to indicate whether immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in MMN. We treated with MM four patients who fulfilled the clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN, aiming to assess whether the drug is safe and may help in reducing or discontinuing IVIg infusion in this disease. MM administration, at 1?g twice daily, was started when patients were still under IVIg treatment and showed minimal or no disability, as judged by the INCAT disability scale. At the third month of MM therapy, IVIg infusion was discontinued in 2 patients and reduced by 20 % in 2 patients. After a follow up ranging from 1 to 6 months, no worsening in the INCAT disability scale was observed in all the patients. One patient discontinued the medication after four months because of gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhea, weight loss and increased amylase/lipase levels. The promising response to MM and the lack of major side effects, warrant further multicentric controlled trials in MMN.

AB  - Summary Abdominal pain is common in school-aged children and is rarely organic, but there is a diverse and extensive differential diagnosis. The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the benefit of supplementing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy with metronidazole in dogs presenting to a primary care veterinary practice with severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Materials and Methods Prospective randomised blinded trial on dogs presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea of less than 3 days duration to a primary care veterinary hospital and also requiring intravenous fluid therapy. Cases were randomised to receive either metronidazole or saline, in addition to standard supportive therapy consisting of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, intravenous fluid therapy, buprenorphine and omeprazole. Treatment efficacy was measured by duration of hospitalisation and daily scoring of disease severity. Results Thirty-four cases successfully completed the trial. There was no significant difference in hospitalisation time between treatment groups (mean for dogs receiving metronidazole was 29.6 hours and for controls was 26.3 hours) nor in daily clinical scores. Clinical Significance This study strongly suggests that addition of metronidazole is not an essential addition to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy for treatment of severe cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea in dogs.

AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Cases were solicited from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology Diplomate listserv. Medical records of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma diagnosed via a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry with or without analysis of polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, chemotherapy protocol, response to treatment, date of first progression, rescue therapies and date and cause of death or last follow-up visit were collected. Results Twenty cases were included. Males and small breed dogs were over-represented. Frequent clinical signs included weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most lymphomas were T-cell phenotype (95%), and epitheliotropism was commonly described (60%). Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement or both were frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Two dogs had resection of an intestinal mass, and all dogs were treated with chemotherapy; chlorambucil and prednisone were most commonly prescribed. Overall response rate was 70%, and median survival time was 424?days (95% confidence interval: 105 to 1206?days). Clinical Significance Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma appears to be a rare condition in dogs, and treatment with chemotherapy results in a high response rate and favourable survival times. Further study is needed to determine its prevalence in dogs with chronic enteropathies.
