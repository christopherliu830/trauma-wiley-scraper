AB  - Abstract Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of linear polyesters consisting of 3,4, 5 and 6-hydroxyacids, synthesized by a variety of bacterial species. PHAs are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units; short-chain-length (scl) PHAs and medium-chain-length (mcl) PHAs. Biodegradability is an essential material property required for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Various methods of manufacture can be used to alter the biodegradability of PHA devices such as by blending with others polymers, increasing the porosity and increasing the exposed surface area. PHAs have also been demonstrated to be suitable for use as scaffolds in tissue engineering since they are easily degradable and favor proliferation and attachment of cells. In the field of skin tissue engineering research, various skin components, cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors have been used experimentally. Melanocytes have been seeded on various polymer scaffolds, as well as sweat and sebaceous glands.

AB  - Vitamin E is a primary chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents cyclic propagation of lipid peroxidation. Across species, vitamin E is essential for normal neuromuscular function by acting as a potent antioxidant, as well as by modulating the expression of certain genes, inhibiting platelet aggregation and stabilizing plasma membranes. This review focuses on vitamin E structure, absorption, metabolism, current equine dietary recommendations, the interplay between antioxidants and exercise, a discussion of the necessity of vitamin E supplementation in the horse above the Nutritional Research Council (NRC) 2007 requirements, and a review of equine diseases that are associated with a vitamin E deficiency. Particular emphasis is placed on the proteins involved in vitamin E absorption, transport, and metabolism as potential candidates for vitamin E-associated diseases across species.

AB  - Abstract Cigarette smoke is known to be associated with the incidence of a variety of pulmonary diseases, and alveolar macrophages are a key player in the defense mechanism against inhalable toxicants. Herein, we have found that a hydrophilic fraction in smoke extracts from 3R4F reference cigarettes (CSE) contains high concentrations of volatile substances compared to cigarette smoke condensate (amphoteric fraction). We also identified the toxic mechanism of CSE using MH-S, a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line. CSE decreased cell viability accompanying increased lactate dehydrogenase release. Additionally, mitochondrial volume and the potential increased along with enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins and decreased adenosine triphosphate production. Similarly, CSE clearly induced increase of catalase activity and intracellular calcium concentration and decrease of endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome volume at the highest dose. More interestingly, damaged organelles accumulated in the cytosol, and CSE-containing particles specifically penetrated to mitochondria. Meanwhile, any significant change in autophagy related protein expression was not found in CSE-treated cells. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of CSE on secretion of inflammatory related cytokines and chemokines, considering the relationship between organelle damage and the disturbed immune response. Very importantly, we found that expression of innate and adaptive immunity related mediators is disrupted following CSE exposure. Taken together, we suggest that CSE may cause the accumulation of damaged organelles in the cytoplasm by impairing selective autophagic function. In addition, this accumulation is responsible for the inadequate ability of immune cells to repair the damage of lung tissue following exposure to CSE.

AB  - Extinction learning is an important mechanism in the successful psychological treatment of anxiety. Individual differences in response and relapse following Cognitive Behavior Therapy may in part be explained by variability in the ease with which fears are extinguished or the vulnerability of these fears to re-emerge. Given the role of the endocannabinoid system in fear extinction, this study investigates whether genetic variation in the endocannabinoid system explains individual differences in response to CBT. Children (N?=?1,309) with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis were recruited. We investigated the relationship between variation in the CNR1, CNR2, and FAAH genes and change in primary anxiety disorder severity between pre- and post-treatment and during the follow-up period in the full sample and a subset with fear-based anxiety disorder diagnoses. Change in symptom severity during active treatment was nominally associated (P?<?0.05) with two SNPs. During the follow-up period, five SNPs were nominally associated with a poorer treatment response (rs806365 [CNR1]; rs2501431 [CNR2]; rs2070956 [CNR2]; rs7769940 [CNR1]; rs2209172 [FAAH]) and one with a more favorable response (rs6928813 [CNR1]). Within the fear-based subset, the effect of rs806365 survived multiple testing corrections (P?<?0.0016). We found very limited evidence for an association between variants in endocannabinoid system genes and treatment response once multiple testing corrections were applied. Larger, more homogenous cohorts are needed to allow the identification of variants of small but statistically significant effect and to estimate effect sizes for these variants with greater precision in order to determine their potential clinical utility. ? 2016 The Authors.
