AB  - Abstract EFSA is requested to assess the safety of a broad range of biological agents in the context of notifications for market authorisation as sources of food and feed additives, enzymes and plant protection products. The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) concept was developed by EFSA for its own use to provide a generic food safety assessment approach applicable across EFSA's scientific Panels, for biological agents notified for intentional use in the whole food chain. The safety of unambiguously defined biological agents at the highest taxonomic unit that is appropriate for the purpose for which an application is intended are assessed, considering if the body of knowledge is sufficient. Identified safety concerns for a taxonomic unit could be reflected as ?qualifications? when considered appropriate for an inclusion on the QPS list. The list of QPS recommended biological agents is reviewed and updated annually. The 2009 update reviews the previously assessed microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi and assesses several additional notifications concerning gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. Lactobacillus cellobiosus, L. collinoides, Propionibacterium acidopropionici and Oenococcus oeni were included in the QPS list. No filamentous fungi were included because of potential production of toxic metabolites. For the first time viruses were assed. Insect viruses (Baculovirideae) and in the case of zucchini yellow mosaic viruses the Potyvirideae family as the highest possible taxonomic unit were added to the QPS list. Bacteriophages were considered as not appropriate for the QPS list. A potential presence of antimycotic resistance of yeasts referred to on the QPS list was considered. It was concluded that yeast strains resistant to antimycotics used for treatment of infections in humans might be of public health concern.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - Summary The genus Staphylococcus includes spherical or slightly oval cocci with a diameter of around 0.5-1.5??m. Genus Staphylococcus is a broad group of microorganisms, among which 47 species and 24 subspecies have been described. The basic division of these bacteria distinguishes two groups: coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). This division results from the ability of S. aureus to clot plasma observed many years ago and the lack of this property in other species known at the time. A consistent increase in the role of coagulase-negative staphylococci in causing hospital infections has been observed in recent years. The membrane ABC proteins are responsible for the active removal of an antibiotic from the staphylococcal cells. From a food safety point of view, the presence of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci should be considered on a number of levels.
