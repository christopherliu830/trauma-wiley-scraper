AB  - Abstract Inspired by the coordinated multiple healing mechanism of the organism, a four-armed benzaldehyde-terminated polyethylene glycol and dodecyl-modified chitosan hybrid hydrogel with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) encapsulation are presented for efficient and versatile wound healing. The hybrid hydrogel is formed through the reversible Schiff base and possesses self-healing capability. As the dodecyl tails can insert themselves into and be anchored onto the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, the hybrid hydrogel has outstanding tissue adhesion, blood cell coagulation and hemostasis, anti-infection, and cell recruitment functions. Moreover, by loading in and controllably releasing VEGF from the hybrid hydrogel, the processes of cell proliferation and tissue remodeling in the wound bed can be significantly improved. Based on an in vivo study of the multifunctional hybrid hydrogel, it is demonstrated that acute tissue injuries such as vessel bleeding and liver bleeding can be repaired immediately because of the outstanding adhesion and hemostasis features of the hydrogel. Moreover, the chronic wound-healing process of an infectious full-thickness skin defect model can also be significantly enhanced by promoting angiogenesis, collagen deposition, macrophage polarization, and granulation tissue formation. Thus, this multifunctional hybrid hydrogel is potentially valuable for clinical applications.

AB  - Progressive brachial and lumbosacral radiculoplexopathies are well known, though infrequent, delayed complications of local irradiation. They present as slowly progressive, generally bilateral but asymmetric, limb weakness mainly affecting distal muscles. The pathogenesis is unknown although some authors supposed an autoimmune process or radio-induced DNA changes. No treatment for this disease is currently available even if some benefits, though transient, have been reported after steroid treatment and more recently, high-dose immunoglobulins (IVIg), suggesting a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis. We previously reported on the beneficial effect of immunotherapies in two patients with postirradiation motor radiculoplexopathy. The first patient had a severe motor lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy starting 20 years after local radiotherapy for seminoma. He became able to walk and run with less waddling and to climb stairs without support after treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. The other patient had severe left brachial and bilateral lumbosacral plexopathies presenting 12 years after toracoascellar and lumbar irradiation for a Hodgkin lymphoma. She improved her right leg strength after one course of IVIg. After one year of continuous steroid therapy the first patient started to progressively deteriorate notwithstanding the subsequent administration of IVIg, resumed courses of steroids, plasma exchanges and azathioprine. The second patient, after one year of continuous IVIg treatment which led to stabilization without further improvement, was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and plasma exchange, with a marginal and transient amelioration followed by progressive worsening that was not halted by the resumption of IVIg. Both patients now suspended any therapy. In conclusion, in both our patients, immune therapies only induced a transient and short-term benefit but did not affect the overall progression of the disease. These findings suggest that even if an immune or inflammatory component, possibly triggered by radiation, may be present in this condition, it does not probably represent the bulk of the pathological process.

AB  - The neuropilins, NP-1 and NP-2, are co-receptors for Sema3A and Sema3F, respectively, both of which are repulsive axonal guidance molecules. NP-1 and NP-2 are also co-receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The neuropilins and their ligands are known to play prominent roles in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation, and blood vessel formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To screen for additional molecular mechanisms by which Schwann cells and fibroblasts contribute to successful PNS axonal regeneration, we used cDNA microarrays (Clontech) to compare expression profile of multiple messenger RNAs in sciatic nerves distal to transection with their levels in normal sciatic nerves. An evocative result of this screen was a 14-fold increase in NP-2 mRNA in the axotomized nerve segments 4 days post-transection. We verified that NP-2 is induced in transected as well as crushed nerve segments by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, and examined the distribution of NP-2 expressing cells in injured sciatic nerves by in situ hybridization. Then, we sought evidences of induction in the injured nerves of the NP-2 ligands, Sema3F and VEGF, and widened our survey to determine whether expression of the functionally related genes, neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and its class 3 semaphorin ligand, Sema3A are also induced in PNS following injury. We showed by in situ hybridization induction of all those genes at four days post-crushed, distally to the lesion. Our results suggest the possibility that the neuropilins and their semaphorin ligands serve to guide, rather than to impede, regenerating axons in the adult PNS.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to toxic substances may induce peripheral and central neurological complications but no cases of acute cranial nerve involvement are reported after single, although massive, exposure to toxic agents. Cranial multineuropathy is an uncommon occurrence. We observed two atypical cases of multinevritis of cranial nerves with mild sensory symptoms at limbs. Both patients had many common features: acute onset, occurrence of neuropraxic block in cranial nerves, and rapid clinical and neurophysiological recovery after corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, the strict time correlation between substance inhalation and acute onset of symptoms suggested a toxic origin of the disease. We emphasize that multinevritis of cranial nerves could be related to acute exposure of toxic substances. Missing this diagnosis could lead to a delay in treatment.

AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.
