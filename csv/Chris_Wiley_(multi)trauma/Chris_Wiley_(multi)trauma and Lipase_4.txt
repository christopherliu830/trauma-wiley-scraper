AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been under development for several decades, but so far none has completed clinical trials due to safety issues, including fundamental concerns regarding hemoglobin-induced vasoconstriction and oxidative reactions. The question becomes whether these attributes are inherent to the hemoglobin molecule itself, or if the molecule can be modified in such a way as to avoid untoward side effects. To this end, Sangart designed a new type of oxygen therapeutic, Hemospan?, based on site-specific, maleimide poly(ethylene) glycol conjugation chemistry. The product, also referred to as MP4, is neither vasoconstrictive nor does it promote oxidation in vivo. The design principles were three-fold: (i) increase hemoglobin molecular size to prolong intravascular retention; (ii) increase oxygen affinity to prevent premature unloading of oxygen in the arterioles, thus avoiding arteriolar vasoconstriction; and (iii) optimize colloidal osmotic pressure and viscosity to enhance blood flow. Preclinical studies with Hemospan in animal models of hemodilution and hemorrhage show maintenance of blood pressure and cardiac output, with improved oxygen delivery compared to early-generation products of cross-linked and polymerized hemoglobins. Four Phase I and II clinical trials have been completed, showing that Hemospan is generally well tolerated in humans, with additional evidence of efficacy through Hemospan's capacity to impart hemodynamic stability in surgical patients. Two multi-center Phase III trials of Hemospan in orthopedic surgery are now underway in Europe.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes a collection of miscellaneous organisms that have caused disease in poultry or are a public health concern. The less common pathogens implicated in poultry loss included are Staphylococcosis, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, Erysipelas, avian intestinal spirochetosis, tuberculosis. Disease syndromes included in the chapter include beak necrosis, venereal disease of geese, and liver granulomas, but are not identified to a specific organism responsible because of the multifactorial nature of the disease. Staphylococcosis is diagnosed by culturing suspected clinical material including exudate from joints, yolk material, and stab swabs of internal organs. Staphylococcosis can resemble infection with Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, reoviruses, or any other infection of bones or joints that is hatchery-related, associated with mechanical trauma, or causes septicemia. Prevention and control of Enterococcus infections require reducing stress and preventing immunosuppressive diseases and conditions. Proper cleaning and disinfection can reduce environmental enterococcal resident flora to minimize external exposure.

AB  - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is commonly seen in dogs and cats and presents a spectrum of disease severities from acute to chronic and mild to severe. It is usually sterile, but the causes and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. The acute end of the disease spectrum is associated with a high mortality but the potential for complete recovery of organ structure and function if the animal survives. At the other end of the spectrum, chronic pancreatitis in either species can cause refractory pain and reduce quality of life. It may also result in progressive exocrine and endocrine functional impairment. There is confusion in the veterinary literature about definitions of acute and chronic pancreatitis and there are very few studies on the pathophysiology of naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs and cats. This article reviews histological and clinical definitions and current understanding of the pathophysiology and causes in small animals by comparison with the much more extensive literature in humans, and suggests many areas that need further study in dogs and cats.

AB  - Background Anlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit). In the phase III ALTER-0303 trial (Clinical Trial Registry ID: NCT 02388919), anlotinib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had received at least two previous chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase targeted therapy regimens. This study summarized adverse event management in this trial. Methods Patients were randomized (2:1) to anlotinib or placebo up to progression or intolerable toxicity. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and managed by investigators. Key strategies for preventing and managing the most common adverse events included patient education, supportive care, and dose modification. Results Between February 2015 and August 2016, 294 patients received anlotinib. A total of 170 (57.8%) patients received antihypertensive medications for hypertension, 53 (18.0%) patients received levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, 24 (8.2%) patients received fibrates for hypertriglyceridemia, 11 (3.7%) patients took cortisone cream for hand-foot syndrome, and 38 (12.9%) patients received anti-diarrheal medications for diarrhea. Dose reduction and drug discontinuation were required in 24 (8.16%) and 31 (10.54%) patients in the anlotinib group, respectively. Conclusion Anlotinb-related adverse events could be controlled by patient education, prophylactic measures, early and active intervention, and dose modification.

AB  - Background Anecdotal reports suggest a recent high prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in Irish wolfhounds, prompting further investigation into the incidence of the disease in this breed. Objectives To investigate the possibility that Irish wolfhounds have an increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and to consider possible predisposing causes in this breed. Methods Retrospective review of medical records from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Sydney, from January 2008 to December 2012 inclusive to determine the total hospital incidence and individual breed incidences of aspiration pneumonia. Results The total hospital incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 0?·?5%. The Irish wolfhound had the highest breed incidence, with 9 of 25 dogs (36%) diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Four of the Irish wolfhounds had a predisposing cause identified; one having a choking episode, one having gastric bloat, while two were diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis after it was specifically investigated because of clinical suspicion. Five had no underlying cause of their aspiration pneumonia determined. Clinical Significance On the basis of the hospital population studied, the Irish wolfhound has a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation into the possible predisposing cause(s) in this breed is warranted.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to report serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations in the progeny of a pair of English setters. These dogs had a history of producing puppies with a high prevalence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) secondary to either congenital deficiency or early onset juvenile atrophy of pancreatic acinar cells. Serum TLI concentrations in the clinically healthy parents of the puppies with EPI were normal, as were serum TLI concentrations in the unaffected puppies. However, serum TLI concentrations were extremely low (less than 1 ?g/litre) in three puppies at eight to 12 weeks of age when clinical signs of EPI were present. In addition, one of the three puppies, with low TLI concentrations at eight weeks of age, had serum TLI concentrations of 0.7 ?g/litre at two weeks of age even though no clinical signs were evident at that time. These results suggest that serum TLI assay may be a useful diagnostic aid in identifying puppies at a very early age with this unusual form of EPI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although long recognized in microvascular research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory markers are present in human diseases. Since the inflammatory cascade serves as a repair mechanism, the presence of inflammatory markers in patient groups has raised an important question about the mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory cascade (i.e., the mechanisms that cause tissue injury). Using a severe form of inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, for which there is no accepted injury mechanism, we summarize studies that suggest that the powerful pancreatic digestive enzymes play a central role in the destruction of the intestine and other tissues if their compartmentalization in the lumen of the intestine and in the pancreas is compromised. Further, we summarize evidence that uncontrolled degrading enzyme activity in plasma causes proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane receptors and loss of associated cell functions. For example, in a model of metabolic disease with type II diabetes, proteolytic cleavage of the insulin receptor causes the inability of insulin to signal glucose transport across membranes. The evidence suggests that uncontrolled proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity may trigger the mechanism for tissue injury. The significance of such mechanisms remain to be explored in human diseases.

AB  - Abstract Objectives As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated easily from adipose tissues while retaining their self-renewal and multi-potential differentiation capacities, they hold promising possibilities for being applied extensively in tissue engineering. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members have been reported to provide instructive signals to MSCs for them to differentiate into several different cell lineages. The study described here aims to investigate whether BMP-4 could promote adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) differentiation into adipocytes under various concentrations. Materials and methods ASCs were isolated from mouse inguinal adipose pads and cultured in vitro. 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml BMP-4 were added to adipogenic media for 8 days. Oil red-O staining, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and immunocytofluorescence staining were performed to examine differentiation of the ASCs. Results As indicated by increased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPAR-?, APN and LPL) and proteins, 50 ng/ml BMP-4 seemed to induce mASCs to differentiate into the adipo-lineage compared to 10 ng/ml BMP-4, and control groups. In addition, lipid droplets accumulated within the adipocytes under 50 ng/ml BMP-4 stimulation, as shown by oil red-O staining. Conclusions Our present study suggests that BMP-4, as an adipo-inducing factor, promoted adipogenesis of ASCs at higher concentrations (50 ng/ml) and can perhaps be considered as a candidate for use in adipose tissue engineering.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemolytic reactions developing during hemodialysis usually are caused by oxidant damage, reduction injury, and osmolar, thermal, and mechanical injury to the red blood cells. Mechanical injury due to maloccluded blood pumps, arterial line collapse, and use of subclavian hemodialysis catheters has been reported. We report one episode of acute hemolysis due to kinked hemodialysis blood lines complicated with pancreatitis. Case Report:?An 18-year-old man with end-stage renal failure of unknown origin had been on hemodialysis since 2002. His past medical history included asthma and hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting during the dialysis session. Laboratory examination showed hematocrit ?30?%, platelet count of 131,000 per cubic mL, LDH ?5151?U/L, haptoglobin ?0.09?g/L, lipase ?919?U/L, CPK- 260, ASAT ?584?U/L, ALAT- 316?U/L, bilirubin ?36??mol/L, and visible schistocytes on smear. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse discomfort and tenderness in epigastrium. The patient was diagnosed as having hemolysis-induced acute pancreatitis. He was treated symptomatically and recovered within a few days. We found the arterial blood line tightly kinked at the dialyser inlet port, and we excluded other reported causes of intravascular hemolysis during hemodialysis. Discussion:?Until a critical pressure is exceeded, despite a kink in the post pump predialyser blood tubing, the blood pump can maintain sufficient blood flow to prevent an increase in the arterial pressure with a triggering of the arterial alarm and a decrease in the venous pressure with a triggering of the venous alarm. Thus, an excessively high pressure can be maintained in this silent segment of the dialyser tubing without activating the pressure alarms, exposing the red blood cells to high sheer stresses and resulting in clinically significant hemolysis. Acute hemolysis can cause a life-threatening acute pancreatitis. The literature indicates that acute pancreatitis is a complication of massive hemolysis with a prevalence of about 20%. The important role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is well known. Heme released from hemoglobin after episodes of vascular hemolysis has the potential to act as a signalling molecule involved in the triggering of the inflammatory processes associated with massive hemolysis. Hemolysis itself may induce acute pancreatitis by all or some pathways of neutrophil activation and chemoattraction, such as oxidative burst, direct proinflammatory effect, microcirculatory disturbance, and increased expression of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - ABSTRACT Standard antibiotic therapy in osteomyelitis patients is of limited value when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), or small-colony variants (SCV) are present. Far better results are obtained by local drug delivery of antibiotic combinations including rifampicin, using a suitable carrier. We therefore investigated release kinetics of antibiotics from biodegradable poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) and in vitro biofilm inhibition of MRSA, MRSE, and S. aureus SCV strains in the course of 24, 72, and 168?h treatment by PTMC, either unloaded, gentamicin-loaded, loaded with rifampicin and fosfomycin, or rifampicin and vancomycin. PTMC appeared to be a suitable carrier for rifampicin alone or in combination with other antibiotics. Biofilm colony forming units and metabolic activity measurement (MTT assay) demonstrated significant (p?<?0.05) inhibition for all strains when PTMC loaded with rifampicin and vancomycin was employed, especially after 168?h treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showed similar qualitative results. PTMC loaded with only gentamicin did not show any inhibition. This exemplifies that PTMC loaded with rifampicin and vancomycin holds promise for the treatment of recalcitrant osteomyelitis. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Abstract: The following review is a brief discussion about spinal cord injury and the possibility of using estrogen as a neuroprotective agent. There are several pathways by which secondary cell death can occur following spinal cord injury, including infiltration of inflammatory cells, generation of reactive oxygen species, decreases in spinal cord blood flow, and increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels. This secondary damage leads to apoptotic cell death, and the neuroprotective effects of pharmacologic agents have been investigated using experimentally induced spinal cord injury in animals. Currently, only high-dose methylprednisolone is advocated for the treatment of patients following spinal cord injury. Estrogen has been shown to be neuroprotective in both in vitro and in vivo studies. There are several possible mechanisms of action by which estrogen may attenuate damage following spinal cord injury and improve functional outcome. Estrogen has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Estrogen levels are correlated with an increase in post-traumatic blood flow to injured tissue. Estrogen may also upregulate protein levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and may attenuate the post-traumatic influx of Ca2+.

AB  - ??Abstract:? We describe the case of a patient with significant adverse effects from posttraumatic analgesic therapy with opioid analgesics who was found by microarray analysis to have a CYP2D6 genotype predictive of a poor metabolizer phenotype. In addition to her poor tolerance and limited response to opioid analgesics, she developed further discomfort when the antiemetic promethazine was administered to treat her gastrointestinal adverse effects. In our discussion we review the literature about the clinical impact of CYP450 2D6 polymorphisms in treatment with the commonly used opioid analgesics codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and morphine, as well as the antiemetic promethazine. The case we present, as well as the literature we review, demonstrates the clinical utility of CYP2D6 genotyping in patients with adverse effects from analgesia therapy.??
