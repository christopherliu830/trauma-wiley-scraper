AB  - Gangliosides (Gs) have been implicated as potential antigens in autoimmune neuropathies and anti-tumoral immune response, but their role in paraneoplastic neuropathy has been poorly investigated. We describe one patient affected by lung adenocarcinoma and subacute motor axonal neuropathy with high titres of IgG1 and IgG3 to several Gs. Expansion (3% of total T cells) of peripheral g/d T lymphocytes was found, as compared to healthy controls (<0.5%) and to patients with lung neoplasia without neuropathy (1.1%). At three months after neoplasia removal, we observed stabilization of the neuropathy, decline of anti-Gs IgG and of g/d T cells, which dropped to normal values. Expression of GM1, GD1a, GM2 and GM3 was found by immunohistochemistry on patient's neoplastic cells, but not in control lung neoplasia. Absorption experiments of anti-Gs IgG revealed that only GD1a and GM1, among all Gs tested, significantly decreased anti-Gs IgG reactivity. Indirect immunohistochemistry with biotinylated IgG purified from the patient showed positive signals on motoneurons, dorsal root ganglia, axonal structures and Schwann cells and his own neoplastic cells. At autopsy, IgG deposits were found on the same neural targets. Purified IgG from the patient exerted high levels of cytotoxicity on both Schwann and neuroblastoma cells, as compared to healthy controls. The association of neoplasia, peripheral neuropathy and autoimmune responses to Gs observed in our patient proposes a pathogenetic role for Gs as putative autoantigens in paraneoplastic neuropathy.

AB  - We describe a patient affected by MMN with CB exhibiting unusual progression and clinical features. MMN is a chronic immune mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive painless asymmetrical weakness usually in distal limb muscles. GM1 antibodies are found in high titer in 22%- 84% of cases. Electrophysiological findings are CB not at usual sites of compression, abnormal temporal dispersion and F-waves, normal or near-normal sensory conduction studies. This 63 year old woman was referred for evaluation of one year and half duration weakness which began in right upper limb and progressed to contralateral and to lower extremities. On first admission (July 2001) neurological examination showed normal cranial nerves and sensory testing, severe asymmetric weakness mainly proximal in the upper extremities and distal in the lower. There were atrophy of small hand muscles and weak deep reflexes. She denied sensory symptoms. There were no upper motor neuron signs. Laboratory tests including CK, tumor marker, CSF, anti-GM1 antibodies were unremarkable. Electrophysiological study was consistent with MMN with CB. Patient underwent IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) and PE without significant improvement. In October 2002, her conditions rapidly worsened: she became quadriplegic, unable to swallow, to chew and to protrude her tongue. Admitted to ICU because of respiratory failure, tracheotomy was performed. Repeated searches for GM1 antibodies gave negative results. CSF was still normal. IVIG was administered twice with partial benefit although severe disability persisted. The case presented has notable features: the rapid monophasic progression to quadriplegia within two years and half, the acute worsening in absence of precipitating events and of systemic illness, the severe involvement of cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. The late response to IVIG is in favor of an immune mediated disorder despite the absence of GM1 antibodies.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - The X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the Connexin 32 gene (Cx32) and is the second most common CMT subtype after CMT1A, in which the 17p11.2 duplication is the underlying molecular defect. CMTX is characterized by no male-to-male transmission, intermediate motor conduction velocities (MCV), and more severe disease in males. In our series of CMT patients, we found 9 different Cx32 mutations in 11 families. Overall there were 26 patients, 13 males and 13 females, aged 11?76?yrs. Age at onset ranged considerably (1?60?yrs), but symptoms began earlier in males (mean 15.4?yrs, 77% within age 20) than in females (mean 25?yrs). All patients were autonomous, but disease severity was greater in males, while 4 female carriers were asymptomatic. Pain and tremor were frequent complaints. Two patients had Babinski sign and one had rest tremor. Nerve conduction studies were performed in 23 patients (13 males, 10 females). Upper limb motor conduction velocities (MCV) ranged between 25 and 57?m/s, and were slower in males (25?48?m/s) than in females (34?57?m/s). MCV were in the upper range of CMT1 (25?38?m/s) in 10/13 males but only in 3/10 females. In some cases, nerve conduction slowing was non-uniform within single nerves, and one female patient had a previous diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. There was considerable asymmetry of involvement between different nerves. The median nerve was often more severely affected than the ulnar nerve, and not only in females, as previously reported, but also in males. Therefore, it appears unlikely that this asymmetry is accounted for by a Lyonization phenomenon. Subclinical abnormalities of central nervous system as revealed by multimodal evoked potential studies were found in 8/10 patients. Expression of Cx32 in the brain is the likely explanation of this finding that confirms previous non-systematic observations. We found seven missense and two nonsense mutations (one novel mutation). Two families presented distinct mutations at the same codon (Arg164), while the Arg22Stop and Arg220Stop mutations were each found in two unrelated cases.

AB  - Summary Most infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women escape HIV infection. Infants evade infection despite an immature immune system and, in the case of breastfeeding, prolonged repetitive exposure. If infants become infected, the course of their infection and response to treatment differs dramatically depending upon the timing (in utero, intrapartum, or during breastfeeding) and potentially the route of their infection. Perinatally acquired HIV infection occurs during a critical window of immune development. HIV's perturbation of this dynamic process may account for the striking age-dependent differences in HIV disease progression. HIV infection also profoundly disrupts the maternal immune system upon which infants rely for protection and immune instruction. Therefore, it is not surprising that infants who escape HIV infection still suffer adverse effects. In this review, we highlight the unique aspects of pediatric HIV transmission and pathogenesis with a focus on mechanisms by which HIV infection during immune ontogeny may allow discovery of key elements for protection and control from HIV.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore current research and theoretical articles on foster home placement of children with severe obesity. Methods An integrative literature review. Literature searches in six electronic databases included theoretical, quantitative and qualitative articles and case reports published in English (2008-2018) on the topic of severe childhood obesity and foster home placement. Results Seventeen selected papers included six theoretical articles, nine quantitative studies, one qualitative study and one case report. Eight of the nine quantitative studies did not specify the grading of obesity in children in foster care. The case report and the qualitative study showed distinct and sustainable body mass index (BMI) reductions after a child had been placed in foster care. Five theoretical articles justified foster care placement when chronic parental neglect led to severe obesity in the child, while one article emphasised the opposite. Conclusion Parental and societal neglect of children with severe obesity placed in a foster home is rarely studied or the exclusive aim of research. The views of the children themselves are lacking in research articles, as well as the child?s right to health obligations concerning children with severe obesity.

AB  - Abstract Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a persistent or recurrent fever for which the underlying source has not been identified despite diagnostic investigation. In people, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) alone or in combination with computed tomography (CT) is often beneficial in detecting the source of fever when other diagnostics have failed. Veterinary reports describing use of these modalities in animals with fever of unknown origin are currently lacking. Aims of this retrospective case series were to describe 18F-FDG-PET or 18F-FDG-PET/CT findings in a group of dogs with fever of unknown origin. Dogs presenting to a single center between April 2012 and August 2015 were included. A total of four dogs met inclusion criteria and underwent either positron emission tomography (n = 2) or positron emission tomography/CT (n = 2) as a part of their diagnostic investigation. All subjects underwent extensive diagnostic testing prior to 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Initial diagnostic evaluation failed to identify either a cause of fever or an anatomic location of disease in these four dogs. In each dog, positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT was either able to localize or rule out the presence of focal lesion thereby allowing for directed sampling and/or informed disease treatment. Follow up 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed in two patients showed improvement of observed abnormalities (n = 1) or detected recurrence of disease allowing for repeated treatment before clinical signs recurred (n = 1). Fever resolved after specific treatment in each dog. Findings from the current study supported the use of positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT as adjunctive imaging modalities for diagnosis and gauging response to therapy in dogs with fever of unknown origin.
