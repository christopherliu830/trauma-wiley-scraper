AB  - SUMMARY The decision of whether a cell should live or die is fundamental for the wellbeing of all organisms. Despite intense investigation into cell growth and proliferation, only recently has the essential and equally important idea that cells control/programme their own demise for proper maintenance of cellular homeostasis gained recognition. Furthermore, even though research into programmed cell death (PCD) has been an extremely active area of research there are significant gaps in our understanding of the process in plants. In this review, we discuss PCD during plant development and pathogenesis, and compare/contrast this with mammalian apoptosis.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD), and retrovirus-induced avian leukoses/sarcoma (L/S) and reticuloendotheliosis. It covers tumors of unknown etiology. The morphology and morphogenesis of MD virus have been reviewed. Several different types of MD vaccines are in common use, both individually and in various combinations. The most widely used products are low-pathogenic serotype 1 MDV, naturally avirulent herpesvirus of turkey (HVT), and serotype 2 viruses. Lymphoid leukosis (LL) has been the most common form of L/S group of diseases seen in field flocks, although myeloid leukosis has become prevalent. LL, a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens affecting primarily the cloacal bursa (bursa of Fabricius) and visceral organs, is the most common form of leukosis that arises from infection with avian leukosis virus (ALV). Eradication of ALV from primary breeding stocks is the most effective means for controlling ALV infection in chickens.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Type 2 diabetes is reaching pandemic levels and young-onset type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly common. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common and distressing complication of diabetes. The pathophysiology and management of diabetic ED is significantly different to nondiabetic ED. Aim.? To provide an update on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management of diabetic ED. Method.? Literature for this review was obtained from Medline and Embase searches and from relevant text books. Main Outcome Measures.? A comprehensive review on epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiolgy, and management of diabetic ED. Results.? Large differences in the reported prevalence of ED from 35% to 90% among diabetic men could be due to differences in methodology and population characteristics. Advancing age, duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and presence of other diabetic complications have been shown to be associated with diabetic ED in cross-sectional studies. Diabetic ED is multifactorial in aetiology and is more severe and more resistant to treatment compared with nondiabetic ED. Optimized glycaemic control, management of associated comorbidities and lifestyle modifications are essential in all patients. Psychosexual and relationship counseling would be beneficial for men with such coexisting problems. Hypogonadism, commonly found in diabetes, may need identification and treatment. Maximal doses of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are often needed. Transurethral prostaglandins, intracavenorsal injections, vacuum devices, and penile implants are the available therapeutic options for nonresponders to PDE5 inhibitors and for whom PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated. Premature ejaculation and reduced libido are conditions commonly associated with diabetic ED and should be identified and treated. Conclusions.? Aetiology of diabetic ED is multifactorial although the relative significance of these factors are not clear. A holistic approach is needed in the management of diabetic ED. Malavige LS, and Levy JC.

AB  - This special issue highlights the emerging needs and challenges associated with care and treatment management of perinatally HIV-infected children who are surviving into adolescence. The articles in this special issue discuss various issues related to the well-being of HIV-infected children and adolescents, including heart, kidney, lung, bone and mental health as well as their epidemiology, metabolism and neurodevelopment. The topics covered in this special issue are current in light of the scarcity of information available related to children with long-term exposure to HIV and multiple antiretrovirals as they transition to adolescence and further into adulthood. Understanding the complexities around the management of antiretroviral therapy in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, who are moving to adult care, and identifying the special needs of these youth is essential for ensuring long and productive lives for this growing population. The special issue is part of the International AIDS Society's ?Collaborative Initiative on Paediatric HIV Education and Research? (CIPHER), supported through an unrestricted educational grant from ViiV Healthcare's Paediatric Innovation Seed Fund.(Published: 18 June 2013)Citation: Journal of the International AIDS Society 2013, 16:18778 http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/18778 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.16.1.18778 http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/pages/view/thematicadolescents

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.
