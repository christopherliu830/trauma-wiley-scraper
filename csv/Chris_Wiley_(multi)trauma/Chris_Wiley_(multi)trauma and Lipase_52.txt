AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering and stem cell therapy hold great potential of being able to fully restore, repair and replace damaged, diseased or lost tissues in the body. Biocompatible porous scaffolds are used for the delivery of cells to the regeneration sites. Marrow stromal cells (MSCs), also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, are an attractive cell source for tissue engineering, due to the relative ease of isolation and the ability of in vitro expanded MSCs to generate multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. This study utilized a novel technique called microwave vacuum drying to fabricate porous gelatin?alginate scaffolds for the delivery of MSCs and investigated the differential in vitro and in vivo responses of MSCs seeded on these scaffolds. Scaffold total porosity was found to decrease with increased cross-link density but the pore size and pore size distribution were not affected. Although highly porous, the scaffold had relatively small pores and limited interconnectivity. The porous gelatin?alginate scaffold demonstrated excellent biocompatibility with neovascularization on the surfaces and was bioresorbed completely in vivo, depending upon the cross-link density. MSCs were able to attach and proliferate at the same rate on the scaffolds, and the self-renewal potential of MSC cultures was similar during both in vitro culture and in vivo implantation. However, the subcutaneous microenvironment was found to suppress MSC differentiation along the osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages compared to in vitro conditions, highlighting the differential responses of MSCs cultured in vitro compared to implantation in vivo.

AB  - Summary This guidance for the management of patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis has been prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI). The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is for use by both adult physicians and paediatricians practicing in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking, consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification of rhinitis, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations and management including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy. There are also special sections for children, co-morbid associations and pregnancy. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.

AB  - Abstract The current review focuses on pathophysiology, animal models and molecular analysis of stroke and retinal ischemia, and the role of stem cells in recovery of these disease conditions. Research findings associated with ischemic stroke and retinal ischemia have been discussed, and efforts towards prevention and limiting the recurrence of ischemic diseases, as well as emerging treatment possibilities with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in ischemic diseases, are presented. Although most neurological diseases are still not completely understood and reliable treatment is lacking, animal models provide a major step in validating novel therapies. Stem cell approaches constitute an emerging form of cell-based therapy to treat ischemic diseases since it is an attractive source for regenerative therapy in the ischemic diseases. In this review, we highlight the advantages and limitations of this approach with a focus on key observations from preclinical animal studies and clinical trials. Further research, especially on treatment with EPCs is warranted. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 1269?1279, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract EFSA received a request from the Hellenic Food Authority for a scientific opinion on estimation of the risk to human health from the presence of chromium (Cr) in food, particularly in vegetables, and Cr(VI) in bottled water. The CONTAM Panel derived a TDI of 0.3 mg/kg b.w. per day for Cr(III) from the lowest NOAEL identified in an NTP chronic oral toxicity study in rats. Under the assumption that all chromium in food is Cr(III), the mean and 95th percentile dietary exposure across all age groups were well below the TDI and therefore does not raise concerns for public health. In the case of drinking water, the Panel considered all chromium in water as Cr(VI). For non-neoplastic effects the lowest BMDL10 for diffuse epithelial hyperplasia of duodenum in female mice and the lowest BMDL05 for haematotoxicity in male rats in a 2-year NTP study were selected as reference points. The MOEs indicate that for non-neoplastic effects the current exposure levels to Cr(VI) via drinking water are of no concern for public health. For neoplastic effects, the CONTAM Panel selected a lowest BMDL10 for combined adenomas and carcinomas of the mouse small intestine as the reference point. Overall, the calculated MOEs indicate low concern regarding Cr(VI) intake via drinking water (water intended for human consumption and natural mineral waters) for all age groups when considering the mean chronic exposure values with the exception of infants at the upper bound (UB) exposure estimates. MOEs below 10 000 were calculated at the UB 95th percentile exposure estimates, particularly for ?Infants?, ?Toddlers? and ?Other children?, which were highly influenced by the relatively high occurrence values under the UB assumption. To improve the risk assessment, there is a need for data on the content of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in food and drinking water.
