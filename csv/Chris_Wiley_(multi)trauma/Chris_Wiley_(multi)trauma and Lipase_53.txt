AB  - Summary The genetic and molecular epidemiology studies carried out in recent decades have considerably enhanced our understanding of the genetic factors contributing to the development of obesity and involved in shaping interindividual differences not only in body weight and adiposity, but in susceptibility to response to energy-balance challenges and the development of several obesity-associated comorbidities. In addition, psychological factors focusing on the association between over-nutrition and behavioural, cognitive, and emotional processes, which may be under genetic or environmental influence, have to be taken into consideration. Weight gain is the consequence of many interacting processes. The majority of surgeons contend that gastric bypass is the bariatric procedure of choice for most patients with severe obesity. In morbidly obese patients refractory to diet and drug therapy, a substantial and sustained weight loss after bariatric surgery is obtained. However, the most effective treatment in the long term is, and will be, obesity prevention.

AB  - Abstract The failure to remyelinate and regenerate is a critical impediment to recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in severe dysfunction and disability. The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that accumulate in MS lesions are thought to be linked to the failure to regenerate, impeding oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and neuronal growth. The potential of endocannabinoids to influence MS progression may reflect their capacity to enhance repair processes. Here, we investigated how 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) may affect the production of the CSPGs neurocan and brevican by astrocytes in culture. In addition, we studied whether 2-AG promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation under inhibitory conditions in vitro. Following treatment with 2-AG or by enhancing its endogenous tone through the use of inhibitors of its hydrolytic enzymes, CSPG production by rat and human TGF-?1 stimulated astrocytes was reduced. These effects of 2-AG might reflect its influence on TGF-?1/SMAD pathway, signaling that is involved in CSPG upregulation. The matrix generated from 2-AG-treated astrocytes is less inhibitory to oligodendrocyte differentiation and significantly, 2-AG administration directly promotes the differentiation of rat and human oligodendrocytes cultured under inhibitory conditions. Overall, the data obtained favor targeting the endocannabinoid system to neutralize CSPG accumulation and to enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation.

AB  - Ba.cil'lus. N.L. masc. n. Bacillus a rodlet. Firmicutes / ?Bacilli? / Bacillales / Bacillaceae / Bacillus Cells rod-shaped, straight or slightly curved, occurring singly and in pairs, some in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Endospores are formed, no more than one to a cell; these spores are very resistant to many adverse conditions. Gram-positive, or Gram-positive only in early stages of growth, or Gram-negative. A meso-DAP direct murein cross-linkage type is commonest, but L-Lys-D-Glu, Orn-D-Glu and L-Orn-D-Asp have occasionally been reported. Motile by means of peritrichous or degenerately peritrichous flagella, or nonmotile. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but a few species are described as strictly anaerobic. The terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, replaceable by alternatives in some species. Most species will grow on routine media such as nutrient agar and blood agar. Colony morphology and size very variable between and within species. A wide diversity of physiological abilities is exhibited, ranging from psychrophilic to thermophilic, and acidophilic to alkaliphilic; some strains are salt tolerant and some are halophilic. Catalase is produced by most species. Oxidase-positive or -negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultative chemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiring several growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates. DNA G + C content (mol%): 32?66 (Tm ). Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Summary Successful pancreas-kidney transplantation liberates patients from dialysis and re-establishes normoglycemic regulation in select patients with type 1 diabetes. Benefit to the recipient must be balanced against surgical morbidity, the adverse effects of life-long immunosuppression and regional waiting times. Data has shown that 5-, 10-, and 20-year graft function rates are 80%, 68% and 45%, respectively, for pancreas-kidney transplants; 62%, 46% and 16%, respectively, for pancreas after kidney transplants; 59%, 39%, and 12%, respectively, for pancreas transplants alone. Anastomotic leak and graft thrombosis decrease graft survival while cardiovascular events represent the major cause of death. Pancreas transplantation appears to ameliorate some of the secondary complications of diabetes but appropriately controlled studies are difficult to perform. Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation should be offered as the primary option in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy who are not yet on dialysis.
