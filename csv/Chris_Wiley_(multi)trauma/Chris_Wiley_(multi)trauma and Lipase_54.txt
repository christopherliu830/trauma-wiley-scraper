AB  - Summary Successful pancreas-kidney transplantation liberates patients from dialysis and re-establishes normoglycemic regulation in select patients with type 1 diabetes. Benefit to the recipient must be balanced against surgical morbidity, the adverse effects of life-long immunosuppression and regional waiting times. Data has shown that 5-, 10-, and 20-year graft function rates are 80%, 68% and 45%, respectively, for pancreas-kidney transplants; 62%, 46% and 16%, respectively, for pancreas after kidney transplants; 59%, 39%, and 12%, respectively, for pancreas transplants alone. Anastomotic leak and graft thrombosis decrease graft survival while cardiovascular events represent the major cause of death. Pancreas transplantation appears to ameliorate some of the secondary complications of diabetes but appropriately controlled studies are difficult to perform. Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation should be offered as the primary option in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy who are not yet on dialysis.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive focus on 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as candidate molecule in a variety of pathophysiological conditions occurring in humans is here provided. Despite an active, now well characterized, metabolism in most cells and tissues, HNE can be easily detected and quantified by means of several methods, although with different sensitivity. Measurements of HNE and/or stable metabolites in biological fluids are already applied as lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress markers in a huge number of human disease processes, often sustained by inflammatory reactions. A primary involvement of this aldehydic product of membrane lipid oxidation in inflammation-related events, as well as in regulation of cell proliferation and growth, in necrotic or apoptotic cell death, appears supported by its marked ability to modulate several major pathways of cell signaling and, consequently, gene expression. The actual knowledge of HNE reactivity, metabolism, signaling and modulatory effect in the various human organs should provide a solid background to the investigation of the aldehyde's contribution to the pathogenesis of human major chronic diseases and would likely promote advanced and oriented applications not only in diagnosis and prevention but also in molecular treatment of human diseases. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely: the herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD); retrovirus-induced avian leukosis/sarcoma, and reticuloendotheliosis. Each of these neoplastic diseases or disease complexes are described in a separate section because of its etiologic distinctness. The chapter also describes tumors of unknown etiology on the basis of morphologic characteristics. Included are a wide variety of benign and malignant neoplasms derived from muscle, epithelial, andnerve tissues; serous membranes; and pigmented cells. Most of the neoplastic diseases can be diagnosed by the characteristic pathological changes in the affected tissues, but confirmed by virological, serological, and molecular methods of diagnosis. While diseases such as MD is controlled mainly by the widespread use of vaccines, most of the retroviral diseases are controlled by eradication of the virus from the infected flocks, supplemented by selection for genetic resistance.

AB  - Abstract The chronology of 2-alkenyl azlactone research at 3M is discussed in terms of its origination; consideration of economics, overall safety, and opportunities for patent protection; elaboration of the chemistry; and, finally, applying lessons learned toward the development of commercial technologies. The chemistry is dominated by the presence of three electrophilic reaction centers and a readily polymerizable 2-alkenyl group. Technological development has been focused in four general areas: acrylamide monomers, acrylamide materials, azlactone materials, and polymer modification. Application areas disinclude lithographic printing plates, contact lens materials, adhesives, dispersants for printing inks, and supports for immobilizing enzymes. ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, but not to the level of being diagnostic for diabetes in a nonpregnant adult. In GDM, whole-body insulin-dependent glucose disposal decreases by 40%-60% which necessitates a 200%-250% increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycaemia. GDM develops when a pregnant woman does not produce sufficient insulin to compensate for the reduced glucose disposal. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that is expressed predominantly in the liver, but also in other metabolically active tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In animals, FGF21 lowers blood glucose levels and inhibits glucagon secretion. In humans, circulating FGF21 levels are increased in insulin-resistant morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An elevated FGF21 level is also an independent predictor of T2DM. GDM and T2DM are proposed to have similar underlying pathophysiologies, raising the question of whether a similar relationship exists between FGF21 and GDM as it does with T2DM. There are a limited number of studies investigating FGF21 levels in patients with GDM. Moreover, recent clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of FGF21 have highlighted a major gap in our understanding of the biology of FGF21. This review evaluates what is currently known about FGF21 and GDM and highlights important gaps that warrant further research.

AB  - To reach ideal therapeutic potential of stem cells for regenerative medicine purposes, it is essential to retain their self-renewal and differentiation capacities. Currently, biological factors are extensively used for stemness maintaining and differentiation induction of stem cells. However, low stability, high cost, complicated production process, and risks associated with viral/endotoxin infection hamper the widespread use of biological factors in the stem cell biology. Moreover, regarding the modulation of several signaling cascades, which lead to a distinct fate, phytochemicals are preferable in the stem cells biology because of their efficiency. Considering the issues related to the application of biological factors and potential advantages of phytochemicals in stem cell engineering, there is a considerable increasing trend in studies associated with the application of novel alternative molecules in the stem cell biology. In support of this statement, we aimed to highlight the various effects of phytochemicals on signaling cascades involved in commitment of stem cells. Hence, in this review, the current trends in the phytochemicals-based modulation of stem cell fate have been addressed. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
