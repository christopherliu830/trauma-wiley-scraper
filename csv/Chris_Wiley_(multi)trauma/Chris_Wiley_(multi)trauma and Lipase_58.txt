AB  - The purpose of this study was to compile a listing of the theses and dissertations completed in colleges and universities of home economics in the United States during 1983 and 1984. The 1,990 titles, received from 87 institutions, are listed by subject-matter area and degree for each year; and the author, institution, and availability of the document are reported. Information about graduate research in home economics is summarized through presentations of totals for each in stitution, by subject matter categories, and through rankings for the institutions reporting the largest number of theses and dissertations. Of all the titles, 25 percent were for dissertations for both years. For both years, the largest number of titles was reported nutrition, while family relations and child development ranked second.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains some of the tissue characteristics and basic principles of imaging and discusses specific applications and techniques in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A magnetic resonance technique that simulates magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) but which differs in principle is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The goal of MRCP is to selectively image fluid within the biliary tree and pancreatic duct. Various comparisons of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and MRI have shown that MRI has significantly better capacity to characterize liver lesions. MRI of the pancreas is optimally performed with a high-performance gradient system (1.5 T) using phased-array torso coil to improve the signal-to-noise ratio with a smaller field of view and thin-slice profile. Magnetic resonance sequences used to evaluate the gallbladder are similar to other imaging protocols used in the abdomen, including axial T1-weighted breath-hold gradient echo (GRE) chemical shift sequences, T2-weighted sequences, MRCP, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences.

AB  - Abstract The time and cost of developing new drugs have led many groups to limit their search for therapeutics to compounds that have previously been approved for human use. Many ?repurposed? drugs, such as derivatives of thalidomide, antibiotics, and antivirals have had clinical success in treatment areas well beyond their original approved use. These include applications in treating antibiotic-resistant organisms, viruses, cancers and to prevent burn scarring. The major theoretical justification for reusing approved drugs is that they have known modes of action and controllable side effects. Coadministering antibiotics with inhibitors of bacterial toxins or enzymes that mediate multidrug resistance can greatly enhance their activity. Drugs that control host cell pathways, including inflammation, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and autophagy, can reduce the ?cytokine storm? response to injury, control infection, and aid in cancer therapy. An active compound, even if previously approved for human use, will be a poor clinical candidate if it lacks specificity for the new target, has poor solubility or can cause serious side effects. Synergistic combinations can reduce the dosages of the individual components to lower reactivity. Preclinical analysis should take into account that severely ill patients with comorbidities will be more sensitive to side effects than healthy trial subjects. Once an active, approved drug has been identified, collaboration with medicinal chemists can aid in finding derivatives with better physicochemical properties, specificity, and efficacy, to provide novel therapies for cancers, emerging and rare diseases.

AB  - Summary Inflammatory conditions of the stomach are among the most common pathological entities of the gut. Helicobacter-associated gastritis is the most common single agent infection worldwide. In the west reactive gastropathy is becoming more common, usually due to drugs and/or alcohol. There are now considerable grounds for regarding reactive gastritis as a gastropathy because one characteristic of its pathology is a singular lack of an inflammatory cell infiltrate. There are other forms of reactive gastropathy, usually with prominent vascular components, such as portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Peptic ulceration is becoming less common in the west. One important factor is the decreasing prevalence of helicobacter infection, a major cause of peptic ulceration worldwide. As with gastritis, drugs are becoming the most important causative factor. However, peptic ulceration, as a whole, remains important, in both the stomach and the duodenum, not least because of the very considerable morbidity of its complications. Although less common than reactive gastropathy and Helicobacter-associated gastritis, there are other important forms of gastritis. Chronic atrophic gastritis is now accepted, principally, as a long-term consequence of helicobacter infection in the stomach. It is often difficult to diagnose on biopsy, but is an important predisposing factor to carcinoma and primary endocrine tumours of the stomach. Not surprisingly, given the highly acidic surroundings, infections other than with Helicobacter sp., which is especially adapted for life in the harsh environment of the stomach, are unusual but they do occur, especially viral gastritides. Lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous gastritis, collagenous gastritis and eosinophilic gastritis all provide interesting pathological problems and have important associations.
