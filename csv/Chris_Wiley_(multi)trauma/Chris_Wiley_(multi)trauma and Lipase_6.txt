AB  - Summary Pancreatitis can be either acute or chronic in nature. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis, which typically presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, include gallstones and alcohol. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, biochemical evidence of pancreatic injury, and imaging studies. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, which presents with chronic abdominal pain, is chronic alcohol use. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, imaging studies, and evidence of endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Treatment of acute pancreatitis includes analgesia, aggressive IV hydration, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in some instances of gallstone pancreatitis. Rarely, acute pancreatitis progresses to necrotizing pancreatitis. Management of chronic pancreatitis includes analgesia, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, and management of malnutrition and diabetes, if present. Finally, autoimmune pancreatitis, typically associated with IgG4 antibodies, responds to treatment with immunosuppression such as prednisone.

Abstract:? The pancreas allograft is a scarce resource that is currently underutilized. The selection of appropriate deceased donors for pancreas procurement is of paramount importance for minimizing technical failure and optimizing long-term outcomes in pancreas transplantation. Despite the increasing demand for pancreas transplantation, increases in overall organ donation rates and the evolution of criteria that constitute an ?acceptable? pancreas donor, the number of deceased donor pancreas transplants being performed in the United States has actually declined in recent years. Although there are many factors that must be considered during evaluation of the potential pancreas allograft donor to minimize morbidity and graft loss, it is evident that there are transplantable organs that are not used. In this review, deceased donor pancreas identification, management, selection, allocation, assessment, preservation, and the problem of pancreas underutilization will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract For several decades, there has been considerable interest in marine-derived long chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) due to their outstanding health benefits. n-3 LCPUFAs can be found in nature either in triglycerides (TAGs) or in phospholipid (PL) form. From brain health point of view, PL n-3 is more bioavailable and potent compared to n-3 in TAG form, as only PL n-3 is able to cross the blood?brain barrier and can be involved in brain biochemical reactions. However, PL n-3 has been ignored in the fish oil industry and frequently removed as an impurity during degumming processes. As a result, PL products derived from marine sources are very limited compared to TAG products. Commercially, PLs are being used in pharmaceutical industries as drug carriers, in food manufacturing as emulsifiers and in cosmetic industries as skin care agents, but most of the PLs used in these applications are produced from vegetable sources that contain less (without EPA, DPA, and DHA) or sometimes no n-3 LCPUFAs. This review provides a comprehensive account of the properties, structures, and major sources of marine PLs, and provides focussed discussion of their relationship to brain health. Epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical studies on n-3 LCPUFAs enriched PLs using different model systems in relation to brain and mental health that have been published over the past few years are discussed in detail.

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

AB  - Summary Reactions involving free radicals are an inherent feature of plant senescence and appear to contribute to a process of oxidative deterioration that leads ultimately to cell death. Radical species derived from molecular oxygen are the primary mediators of this oxidative damage, but non-radical excited states of oxygen, specifically singlet oxygen, may also be involved. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation of lipids in senescing membranes and the ensuing release of free fatty acids initiate oxidative deterioration by providing substrate for lipoxygenase. In some tissues, lipoxygenase activity increases with advancing senescence in a pattern that is consistent with its putative role in promoting oxidative damage. However, there are important exceptions to this which may be explained by the fact that the timing and extent of peroxidative reactions initiated by lipoxygenase are likely to be determined more by the availability of substrate for the enzyme than by changes in its activity. There are both membranous and cytosolic forms of lipoxygenase in senescing tissues, and peroxidation of membrane lipids appears to be initiated by the membranous enzyme once the appropriate fatty acid substrates, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, become available. Since lipid peroxidation is known to form alkoxy and peroxy radicals as well as singlet oxygen, these reactions in membrane bilayers are probably a major source of activated oxygen species in senescing tissues. Further-more, there are indications that activated oxygen from the lipoxygenase reaction can become substrate for the cytosolic form of the enzyme which, in turn, may raise the titre of activated oxygen during senescence. Additional possible sources of increased free radical production in senescing tissues include peroxidase, which shows greatly increased activity with advancing age, leakage of electrons from electron transport systems to oxygen, in particular from the photosynthetic electron transport system, and decompartmentalization of iron, which would facilitate formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from the less reactive superoxide anion. A variety of macromolecules can be damaged by activated oxygen. Unsaturated fatty acids are especially prone to attack, and this implies that membranes are primary targets of free radical damage. The manifestations of this damage in senescing tissues range from altered membrane fluidity and phase properties to leakiness that can be attributed to a destabilized and highly perturbed membrane bilayer. There is also a progressive breakdown of cellular protein with advancing senescence. Free radicals can inactivate proteins by reacting with specific amino acid residues, and a number of in zitro studies have indicated that such alteration renders the proteins more prone to hydrolysis by proteases. Thus, although there is no direct evidence linking enhanced proteolysis during senescence to free radical damage, there is reason to believe that this may be a contributing factor. Wounding of certain plant tissues also initiates a series of reactions that revolve around the breakdown of membrane lipids and their peroxidation. Indeed, as in the case of senescence, membrane deterioration follokving wounding appears to be facilitated by a self-perpetuating wave of free radical production emanating from peroxidation within the lipid bilayer. There is also recent evidence for activation of an O2? -producing NADPH oxidase in plant tissues following fungal infection that may be analogous to the well-characterized O2?-generating NADPH oxidase associated with the plasma membrane of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This raises the interesting possibility that plants and animals share a common defence response to invading organisms.

AB  - Summary The current management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is maximal conservative therapy within an intensive care environment. The only commonly accepted indication for operative intervention is the presence of infected pancreatic necrosis. We present a case wherein a laparotomy performed for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) arising in the setting of SAP in the absence of pancreatic necrosis prevented early mortality and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of ACS as a new indication for operative intervention in SAP.
