AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred blood access for hemodialysis due to its longevity and resistance to infection. Little attention is given to the long-term hemodynamic consequences of large left-to-right shunts, particularly in patients with brachial artery fistulae. Materials and Methods:?We describe 9 patients (8 on dialysis, 1 post-transplant), aged 25?73, who developed clinical heart failure, primarily due to large, upper arm AVFs. Results:?4/9 had access flows in excess of 2 liters/min, assessed by blood temperature monitoring. 6/9 had cardiac output measured by right heart catheterization, before and after shunt compression. One also underwent left heart catheterization with ventriculography. 3/9 had surgical reduction of the fistula, either by banding or by serial interposition of small caliber GoreTex graft. In 2/9 the shunt was ligated. One patient had heart failure in association with 2 large, upper arm AVFs, one of which was ligated. After years of improved cardiac symptoms, heart failure recurred in association with marked hypertrophy of his remaining AVF. Resting cardiac output in this patient was in excess of 11 liters/min. 2/9 experienced acute onset of heart failure within 1?3 days of angioplasty of a venous stenosis. One of these, with very poor baseline cardiac function, expired. Surgical revision or ligation was accompanied by clinical improvement in the 5 patients so treated. One of these expired of a stroke after two months of cardiac improvement. Conclusion:?High output heart failure is under-diagnosed in dialysis patients. Patients with large upper arm shunts are particularly at risk. Access flow should be assessed regularly and those with outputs >1.5 liters/min should be monitored closely for development of heart failure. Surgical correction is beneficial and indicated in symptomatic patients.

AB  - It has already been established that the most frequent cause of death in patients (pts) on RDT is cardiovascular. In fact, more than half of the deaths are related to cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the study was to investigate in pts with end-stage renal disease the impact of hypertension on LVMI, a parameter which has already been found increased in early renal disease. Two hundred ninety seven pts (174 male) were included in this study with a mean follow-up of 3 years. Sixty- six percent of these pts (first group) were on antihypertensive agents with one or more (in combination up to 4) drugs. Analytically, as monotherapy or in combination, 29.7% of the pts were taking a ?-blocker, 25.7% an a MEA, 8.9% an angiotensin receptor antagonist, 51.5% a calcium channel blocker, 11.9% a centrally active agent and 1% an α-blocker. Forty-four percent of the pts (secound group) were not on antihypertensive therapy at any time. Left atrial dimension (LAD) less than 3?cm, left venticular volume (LVV) less than 150?ml, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) less than 130?gm/m2 for male and less than 100?gm/m2 for female pts were considered as normal values. The above parameters were measured using 3D Gen. Electric echocardiograph (Model VIVIO 3). There was no difference between the 2 groups in sex, age, EPO administration, high or low flux filter dialysis, and remaining urine volume. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant correlation between the systolic blood pressure (BP) and the blood urea before dialysis (p?=?0.015) and the increase of body weight in between dialysis (p?=?0.03). Finally, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in LAD and LVV, but 37.8% of the hypertensives had higher LVMI as compared with 23.2% of the normotensives (x2?=?3.028, p?<?0.05). In conclusion, mainly the pts who had no compliance with their diet needed antihypertensive treatment. On the other hand, despite the clinically efficient antihypertensive therapy, the LVMI remained high in this group, and possibly this is one of the reasons of higher morbidity and mortality in this category of patients as it has already been shown in pts before starting haemodialysis.

AB  - Background:? Among patients receiving chronic HD, therapy with paricalcitol (Z) was associated with reduced mortality and morbidity compared to treatment with calcitriol (C). Furthermore, patients who did not receive any vitamin D therapy experienced highest mortality and morbidity. This study examined the hypothesis of a relationship between the dose of Z and subsequent hospitalization, more specifically, that patients receiving lower doses of Z would have a higher risk of being hospitalized. Methods:?We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients new to HD who received treatment with Z or C between Jan 1999 and Dec 2001 using Poisson regression models. The primary exposure variable was the average dose/day, examined as categorical data by quintiles, during a 3-month and then 12-month follow-up period excluding the days in hospitals. This latter exclusion was made due to uncertainty of the treatment during the period of hospitalization. Additional covariates included vitamin-D group (Z vs. C), age, gender, race, and diabetes status, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH. Results:?We first examined dose of Z and C over a 3-month period and then hospitalizations over the ensuing year. We did not find a dose-response relationship in these analyses ? i.e., dose over the first three months of dialysis is not associated with increased or reduced risk of hospitalizations during the ensuing 12 months. We then examined average dose of Z or C over the entire year and risk for hospitalization during the same year. Compared to total doses, average doses (total dose over the entire year divided by number of dialysis sessions during the same year) are less prone to bias. Risk of hospitalizations according to dose (lowest dose, Quintile 1) of injectable vitamin D is shown in the table below: Quintile HR 95% CI 1 1.093 1.025?1.165 2 1.073 1.007?1.143 3 1.055 0.990?1.124 4 1.050 0.978?1.116 5 1.0 REF Compared to those who received the highest doses of injectable vitamin D, those receiving the lowest had a 9% increased risk for a hospitalization. At each level, the risk for hospitalizations was 4% lower with Z compared to C. Conclusion:?This pilot study indicates that higher average doses of Z are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and suggests additional beneficial effects of vitamin D beyond mineral metabolism and PTH control.

AB  - Objective:? In this study, we initiated a new hemodialysate with citrate buffer, observed the factors that influence the citrate concentration of solution in hollow fibers when using citrate hemodialysate, and observed the anticoagulant effect and safety of the citrate hemodialysate in the experiment in dogs. Methods:?Ten dogs were given intermittent hemodialysis and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures. Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate; Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysis without any anticoagulant; Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and heparin. ACT, Ca++, BUN, Cr, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, Na+, Cl?, , and venous pressure were monitored in the animals of each group during hemodialysis. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous pressure increased lastingly, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 2 hours. Hemodialysis for 2 hours in Group 2 were all finished successfully. ACT was extended and Ca++ decreased obviously in the venous end during hemodialysis. And ALT, AST, Ca++, K+, Na+, Cl?, after the hemodialysis in Group 2 were not changed (P?>?0.05). Moreover, the clearance rate of the dialyzers with citrate dialysate increased significantly compared with those of saline-flush and heparin anticoagulation. Conclusions:?The anticoagulant and dialytic effects of the new type citrate hemodialysis are satisfactory and better than that of saline-flush.

AB  - Objective:? This observational study was undertaken to evaluate the frequency of acute complications occurring during dialysis sessions and their association with other clinical and biochemical parameters. Method:?Forty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were selected and evaluated. Mean of the weekly evaluations of different parameters over a three-month period is presented here. Result:?Age of study subjects was 39?±?13 years and body mass index (BMI) 21?±?4?kg/m2. Duration of hemodialysis was 41?±?29 months. Most of the patients were hypertensive (98%), taking multiple anti-hypertensive drugs. Mean of the blood pressures before and at the end of dialysis sessions over the three month period were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 159?±?18 vs. 163?±?22 (p?<?0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 92?±?13 vs. 87?±?7?mmHg (p?<?0.003). Frequency of acute complicating symptoms during dialysis sessions were: headache (75%), rise in blood pressure (73%), leg cramps (67%), vomiting (60%), palpitation (58%), sweating (52%), and hypotension (35%). Raised blood pressure showed a positive correlation with headache (r?=?0.50, p?<?0.01) and sweating (r?=?0.53, p?<?0.05). Vomiting and palpitation were more frequent at low post-dialysis blood pressure (vomiting vs. post-SBP-r?=??0.41, p?<?0.05 and palpitation vs. post-DBP-r?=??0.48, p?<?0.05), and these patients were likely to get inadequate dialysis (hypotension vs. Kt/V-r?=??0.63, p?<?0.01). Pre and post dialysis weight variation was 53?±?11 vs. 51?±?11?kg (p?<?0.001), average ultrafiltration during dialysis (UF)?2.39 (0.5?4) liter and single session Kt/V was 0.95?±?0.38. The rising tendency of post-dialysis blood pressure correlated positively with increasing UF (SBP vs. UF-r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and DBP vs. UF-r?=?0.25, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:?From this study it may be concluded that acute complications during dialysis sessions have a significant correlation with deranged blood pressure regulation, and optimum control of blood pressure could provide better dialysis.

AB  - Hemodialysis is a common treatment of chronic renal failure, also in childhood. Due to the high standard of technique there are only few contraindications for this treatment at present. Limitations are given by the vessel access. But in the last years, hemodialysis has been made practicable by the permanent central venous catheter, however, with more problems. As an example for potential complications in the treatment with the permanent catheter we present an unusual case report about a twenty-one- year-old girl suffering from chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy, Prader-Willi- syndrome, myelonatrophia of undetermined origin with spastic diplegia of the legs, and increasing sphincter ani dysfunction. We started the renal replacement therapy when the girl was 15 years old. It was not possible to create an AV fistula due to very small vessels. Two Gore-Tex ? implants were clotted in absence of thrombophilia. Afterwards, the hemodialysis was performed by a permanent central venous catheter. The catheter had to be changed 15 times. The reasons for changing the catheter were problems of flow during hemodialysis due to clotting, dislocations, spontaneous removing of the catheter by herself, and infections. Altogether a sepsis occurred four times. The first transplantation failed due to a rupture of the transplanted kidney. A second transplantation was not possible because of the high BMI. Intermittently, the girl was treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the hospital, because the PD couldn?t be done at home due to different reasons. Only on weekends could the girl go home. The PD had to be finished after 6 months due to a severe psychotic syndrome. The girl died at age 21, caused by a sepsis following the 15th change of the catheter. A huge problem of frequent catheter changing is the limited availability of vessel accesses ? the limits of treatment by hemodialysis.

AB  - Copper (CU) deficiency, as reflected by a low serum CU and ceruloplasmin (CER) level, is a rare complication of chronic HD. When present, common clinical manifestations include anemia and neutropenia. Anecdotally, CU deficiency has been linked to the use of sevelamer hydrochloride (SH), a recently introduced phosphate binding agent. The finding of severe CU deficiency and rHuEPO-resistant anemia in 3 of our patients (pts) prompted a review of our entire pediatric HD population for the frequency of CU deficiency and its possible relationship to SH. An assessment of serum CU was conducted in 17 pts (male-11; mean age 169.4?+?49.6?mo) who had received HD for 21.5?+?33.9 months. All pts received three 4-hour HD sessions weekly with mean single-pool and equilibrated Kt/V values of 2.29?+?2.5 and 1.56?+?0.37, respectively. 14 of 17 (82%) pts had low serum CU levels with a mean value of 69.1?+?38.3?mcG/DL (normal?= 85?150?mcG/DL). 9 of 17 (53%) pts had values <60?mcG/DL and 3?pts had values <25?mcG/DL with CER values of 1.2?mg/dL, 0.6?mg/dL, and 1.8?mg/dL, respectively (normal?=?24?40?mg/dL). In the latter 3?pts, hemoglobin values fell to 5.4?gm/dL, 5.2?gm/dL, and 9.2?gm/dL despite regular rHuEPO dosing and adequate iron stores and all pts responded to supplemental CU therapy. The mean hemoglobin of the remaining 14?pts was 11.7?+?1.3?gm/dL. Whereas 13 of 14 (93%) CU deficient pts were receiving SH (142.1?+?112.3?mg/kg/d) for 331.0?+?293.6 days at the time of the CU assessment, there was no significant relationship demonstrated between the dose of SH or the duration of SH therapy and the serum CU level. In conclusion, CU deficiency appears to commonly occur in pediatric HD pts with extremely low values associated with profound anemia responsive to CU therapy. While the chronology of CU deficiency and the introduction of SH suggests an association, additional research is necessary to address this issue in a more definitive manner.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information exists on the use of any intravenous iron preparation in pediatric HD patients. This study was designed to describe the PK parameters of FG, now approved for use in children on HD. Methods:Iron-deficient pediatric HD pts (≤15?yr) were randomized to 2 doses of FG. Blood samples taken during a 1?hr infusion and at intervals over 48?hrs were analyzed for total iron, transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and FG-bound iron (FGI). Results:49% of pts were male, 88% white, 57% age 6?12?yr, wt 16.3?63.2?Kg, ht 100?177.5?cm. Mean serum iron concentrations (total iron and FGI) rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner, approximately proportional to the FG dose administered. A rapid rise in total serum iron was followed by a slower, less prominent rise in TBI. Single-dose PK of FGI was adequately described using non-compartmental analytical methods. A standard 2-compartment NONMEM model successfully fit the data and accurately described the time-course of FGI concentrations. Pharmacokinetic Parameter 1.5?mg/kg FG (n?=?22) 3.0?mg/kg FG (n?=?26) Cmax(mean?±?SD,?mcg/dL) 1287?±?285 ???2283?±?637 AUC0?48(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9327?±?4038 16,830?±?6526 AUC0?∞(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9499?±?4089 17,087?±?6776 Tmax(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???1.1?±?0.23 ???1.1?±?0.19 t1/2(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???2.0?±?0.7 ???2.5?±?1.8 Kel(mean?±?SD,?hr?1) ??0.43?±?0.30 ??0.39?±?0.27 Cl (mean?±?SD,?L/hr) ??0.69?±?0.50 ??0.66?±?0.52 Vd(mean?±?SD,?L) ???1.6?±?0.6 ???1.9?±?1.1 Conclusions: Cmax values in pediatric HD population were similar to Cmax values previously reported with similar FG doses in healthy iron-deficient adults (Ferrlecit? prescribing information). In contrast, mean AUC0?∞ values were approximately 2 times greater, and mean Cl rates were 5.4 times slower in pediatric pts.

AB  - In this paper we?ll discuss how change management affects hemodialysis improvement. As hemodialysis is a technology dependent method of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) treatment, it is obvious that the need of continuous revisions in health care practices and researches on staff training are significant factors for success. ?Change? defined as an attempt to replace existing knowledge with new. Change achievement is not always a simple procedure. In this study we examine nurses and patients reactions on changes and how can we accomplish successful changes every time they are needed. We also examine how changes in role of health care team can lead the team to our final destination, which is to provide the best hemodialysis treatment we can. Leadership, communication, informing, planning, and adjusting are the main contents for successful change management. We believe that we can improve haemodialysis practices and health care by giving learning opportunities to our nurses. Nursing training development can help them to follow changes. On the other hand we can get our patients to come on board with us on any change by encouragement and consistent try. As Hereticus said, ?Nothing that is, has to be just because it is.? Therefore, we should keep thinking about managing changes all the time!

AB  - Background:? Central venous stenosis in chronic hemodialysis patients occurs in about 17% of all venous stenosis and it is associated with central vein catheterization. We evaluated the effect of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?We retrospectively investigated the medical records of a total of 31 dialysis patients who had central venous stenosis. We reviewed the causes of central venous stenosis, clinical manifestations, venographic findings, and patency rate of radiological intervention. Results:?Of the total 31 patients, 28 patients had past history of central vein catheterization ipsilateral to vascular access. Mean duration of the catheterization was 32?±?14 days. Venography showed complete obstruction of central vein (n?=?14) and stenosis (n?=?17). The site of venous lesion was right subclavian vein (n?=?11), innominate vein (n?=?9), left subclavian vein (n?=?7), and superior vena cava (n?=?14). A total of 30 procedures of angioplasty with or without stenting were performed in 26 of 31 patients. Initial success rate was 96.1% and there was no severe complication such as rupture or bleeding. The primary patency rate at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after the procedure was 87.3%, 75.6%, 67.9%, and 65.4%, respectively. The cumulative patency rate at the same time point was 96.0%, 90.6%, 74.0%, and 72.8%, respectively. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that angioplasty with or without stenting is safe and effective in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients.

Central venous access devices (CAVDs) are essential tools for the administration of many therapeutic modalities, especially for patients requiring lifetime therapy like hemodialysis. There are several reasons to salvage the occluded catheter. Catheter replacement results in an interruption of therapy delivery. This interruption may result in complications such as life-threatening metabolic and physiologic states. In addition, the patient's future access sites for CAVDs may be affected. The data released in the 2001 Annual Report ? ESRD Clinical Performance Measures Project (Department of Health and Human Services, December 2001) shows 17% of prevalent patients were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer. In the pediatric population the data shows that 31% were dialyzed with a chronic catheter. The most common reasons for catheter placement included: no fistula or graft created (42%) and fistula and graft were maturing, not ready to cannulate (17%). Five percent of patients were not candidates for fistula or graft placement as all sites had been exhausted. Methods:?A short study was done in our medical center to evaluate the results of t-PA vs. changing the tunnel catheter. On an average a catheter costs about $400.00. If you add the cost of specialty personnel such as an interventional radiologist, radiology technician, radiology nurse, and the ancillaries such as the room, sutures, gauze, and tape, the total could reach $2000.00 easily. Cathflo? Activase? costs around $60.00 for a single dose. T-PA was reconstituted by pharmacy personnel in single vials containing 2?mg/2?ml. Now with Cathflo, vials are stored in the renal clinic's refrigerator and when the need arises, the RN reconstitutes the medication. The RN, using established protocols, will instill Cathflo in the catheter following the volume requirements of the various tunnel catheters. After the t-PA is placed, the patient is sent home with instructions to return to their dialysis center the next day (arrangements are made by the RN as needed). In seventeen patients (17) with tunnel catheter malfunctions due to inadequate flow, not related to placement, t-PA was used. Of those 17 patients 2 were unable to use their catheter on their next dialysis treatment date, yielding an 88% success rate. This compares with clinical trials in which there is an 83% success rate with a dwell time of 4 hours, or an 89% rate on patients having a 2 hour dwell time (t-PA was repeated a second time if flow was not successfully restored. Results:?15/17 patients in our retrospective study showed that Cathflo worked successfully in restoring blood flow. Two catheters needed to be exchanged. The cost savings were significant when we compared the average cost of an exchange ($2000) versus using t-PA ($170 including nursing time). Conclusion:?Cathflo is not just safe and practical to use but also cost effective.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%

AB  - Purpose:? Performed free coagulant hemodialysis to patients having hemorrhage with the hope to avoid aggravation of bleeding caused by anticoagulant agent from dialysis. Method:? Examined 19 cases of patients with bleeding tendency, whether it is possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis by using PAES membrane, EVAL membrane, PS membrane, Cellulose triacetate membrane and Vitamin-E modified-dialysis membrane. Result:?With PAES membrane, the result showed a non- blockade rate of 91% after four hours and 100% after two hours. Therefore, blockade was prevented with a fairly high rate. In cases of blockade, most of them were possibly avoidable with a little contrivance as the reason were lack of establish blood flow rate, faulty position of a needle, etc. Conclusions:?By using PAES membrane, it was possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis. In order to completely have no blockade of blood lines in the future, we must strive further on.

AB  - The dialysis industry has become increasingly concerned about microbial contamination of reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Conventional membranes cannot be thoroughly sanitized due to the use of a peripheral seal which creates a stagnant area between the pressure vessel inner diameter and the membrane outer area. Cleaning procedures cannot adequately sanitize this annular area and control microbiological contamination. Sanitary full fit membranes ensure that a percentage of the feed water is free to bypass or flow around the outside of the membrane element to assure the annular area is continuously flushed and that there are no stagnant areas not exposed to CIP cleaning and sanitizing procedures. For this reason, the dairy industry has for many years used sanitary membranes, which are required by and approved by the USDA. Of the several full fit sanitary membranes available, the cage wrap, net wrap, and tail wrap, only the hard shell TurboCleanTM eliminates the inconsistent bypass flows inherent in the other designs, controlling the distribution of cleaning and sanitizing agents and providing better cleaning and lower microbial levels.

AB  - The Aksys PHD System, designed to utilize ultrapure dialyzate for quotidian hemodialysis at home, uses mechanical cleaning and hot water sanitization of the blood, dialysate, and water flow-paths from inlet to outlet. Since January 2000, it has been used by 110 US patients and 8 UK patients for a total of 106 patient years and more than 30,000 dialyses runs. Of those treated, 75 patients were male and 43 female; mean age was 52?±?25 (range 22?82) years; 65% were white, 25% black, and 10% other; mean weight was 78?±?20 (44?125)?kg; the cause of renal failure was primary renal disease (50%), hypertension (24%), diabetes (19%), and other (4%). Dialysis access included fistula (61%), graft (25%), and catheter (14%). Patients had been on ESRD therapy on average of 6?±?7 (0?32) years when starting on PHD dialysis. As of August 2004, patients had dialyzed 11?±?8 (1?52) months on the PHD. Of those, 78 patients remained on the PHD, 12 were transplanted, 10 died, 7 returned to conventional dialysis at the end of the original study for the FDA and 7 for medical or social reasons, 2 returned to quotidian dialysis on other equipment, and 2 stopped during home dialysis training. Patients dialyzed an average of 145?±?27?min, 5.6?±?0.6 dialyses/week with a QB of 376?±?45?ml/min and a QD of 545?±?170?ml/min. eKt/V was 0.68?±?0.20 and weekly stdKt/V was 2.61?±?0.52. Mean dialyser reuse was 17?±?14 times without significant decline in urea clearance. 23/118 patients (19%) who came to the PHD from quotidian dialysis on other equipment thought the PHD twice as easy to use and experienced only half as many episodes hypotension, cramps, headache, backache, nausea, and arrhythmias (all p?<?0.02). They were hospitalized only half as many days on the PHD. Cumulative patient survival was 60% at 4 years, with 94 deaths/1,000 patient years, relative risk 0.56 compared with age-matched patients from the USRDS database. Conclusion: This large clinical experience shows the PHD System is easier to use and delivers smoother dialysis with better cardiovascular stability than conventional dialysis machines. It easily fulfills the DOQI guidelines for adequacy of dialysis, economizes on use of dialyzers, tubing, and dialysate, results in less hospitalization, and appears to result in superior patient survival.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.
