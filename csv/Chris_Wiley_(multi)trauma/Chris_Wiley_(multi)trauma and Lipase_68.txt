AB  - Background:? Both chronic HCV infection and schistosomiasis are major health problems in Egypt. The high prevalence of HCV infection in bilharzial patients had been postulated to be due to HCV transmission during past anti-bilharzial parental therapy. The aim of the work was to study the possibility of transmission of HCV through the life cycle of schistosomiasis. Subject and Methods:?The study included 180 patients divided into four groups: Group I:?Included 40 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on regular hemodialysis (RH) with hepatic schistosmiasis (HS) and previous history of blood transfusion (BT). Group II:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with HS and had no previous history of BT. Group III:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with no evidence of HS and no previous history of BT. Group IV:?Included 60 patients with HS with normal renal function and no previous history of BT. In addition 20 healthy persons were included as a control group. In addition to the routine investigations the patient groups were subjected to HCV Ab, HBsAg, HBcAb, HBcAg, anti bilharzial Ab, abdominal ultrasonography, rectal snip for patients positive for anti bilharzial Ab, and in-situ hybridization (ISH) for HCV RNA and HBV DNA in the rectal snips positive for living schistosoma ova obtained from bilharzial patients positive for markers of HCV and HBV, respectively. Results:?HCV Ab was detected in 92.5%, 65%, 55%, and 76.7% in groups I, II, III, IV, respectively, compared to 25% in the control group. Anti-schistosomal Ab was detected in 75%, 50%, and 71.7% in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. A highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and anti-schistosomal Ab positivity among all bilharzial groups (P?<?0.01 in group I and P?<?0.001 in groups II & IV). Rectal snips were positive for living schistosoma ova in 76.7%, 90%, and 81.4% of anti-schistosomal Ab positive cases in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. Moreover, a highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and rectal snip positivity among the 3 bilharzial patients groups (P?<?0.001 in groups I & II and P?<?0.01 in group IV). On the other hand, there was no significant association between HBs Ag and either anti-schistosomal Ab positivity or rectal snip positivity. ISH revealed HCV RNA in 26.3% of schistosomal ova-positive rectal snips. In contrast, the examined biopsies were negative for hybridization of HBV DNA. Conclusion:?Schistosomiasis might play a role in the transmission of HCV through its life cycle and this also may explain the significant association between HCV and schistosomiasis.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects survival and morbidity of end-stage renal disease patients and also increases treatment costs. Aim of this study is to define prevalence of HCV infection in our hemodialysis (HD) units and documenting past interventions and clinical status of patients. 711 patients were included. Patient data were collected from 4 HD units of Baskent University. Patient records were examined for demograpic findings, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, liver biopsy, interferon treatment information, last 12 months? laboratory values (serum transaminases, albumin, lipid profiles, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein), and current clinical status, retrospectively. 143 patients (3%) were anti-HCV positive. These patients? alanine transferase levels (23.5?±?20.5 vs 15.5?±?12.8?U/L, p?<?0.0001) and HD duration (97.9?±?58.6 vs 46.3?±?35.6 months, p?<?0.0001) were significantly higher. No other significant difference could be identified between the groups. Analysis of HD duration of anti-HCV positive patients revealed that prevalance was increasing as the duration increased. Anti-HCV positivity was known for a mean of 60.4?±?38.8 months while 44 patients (30.7%) were already infected at initiation of HD. HCV RNA analysis was positive in 26.7% and a liver biopsy was performed in 23% of patients after 19.8?±?23.3 months following positive anti-HCV identification. Minimally active chronic hepatitis C was the most common pathological diagnosis (70, 3%). Only 18 patients (12.5%) recieved interferon therapy. None of the patients had chronic liver disease clinical and physical findings by the time this study was done. HCV infection is a common problem in HD patients that increases the need for medical interventions and treatment.

AB  - Background:? Because of high incidence of acquired renal cyst and renal malignancy, it is suggested that spontaneous renal rupture more frequently occurs in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis than in the general population. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?This retrospective study enrolled 12 hemodialysis patients who developed spontaneous renal rupture. We investigated primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, clinical symptoms and signs, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and histologic findings. Result:?The mean age of the patients was 54?±?10 years old and the number of male was 9. Primary renal disease consisted of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PCKD)(n?=?5), chronic glomerulonephritis (n?=?2), diabetic nephropathy (n?=?1), hypertensive nephropathy (n?=?1), unknown cause (n?=?3). Presenting symptoms and signs were sudden onset of flank pain in 9 patients and gross hematuria with mild flank pain in 3 patients. Mean duration from initiation of hemodialysis to development of spontaneous renal rupture was 53?±?36 months. Abdominal computed tomography showed subcapsular or perinephric hematoma in all patients. Of the 7 non-PCKD patients, 6 patients had multiple acquired renal cysts. Surgical exploration was undertaken in 9 patients. Pathologic examination demonstrated small sized renal cell carcinoma in 2 of 9 patients. Three patients were only treated with conservative management including blood transfusion. All 12 patients recovered without recurrence. Conclusion:?This study demonstrated that genetic or acquired renal cyst was an important cause of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients and presenting manifestations were sudden onset of flank pain and gross hematuria.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - An increased frequency of the Milk-Alkali syndrome in the last several years has been noticed related to increasing use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder in CKD patients, as an antacid or as calcium supplementation. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Milk-Alkali syndrome that precipitated acute renal failure requiring urgent hemodialysis. A 59-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acid reflux presented to the ER with confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His family relayed a history of recent indigestion and relief with Tums. He was taking several tablets at short intervals to self-treat the indigestion. At the time of presentation, patient was confused and noted to be dehydrated. Lab findings were significant for elevated BUN/Cr- 121?mg/dl/11.1?mg/dl (baseline Cr 1.1?mg/dl few months ago), bicarbonate 38?mg/dl, calcium 16.7?mg/dl, ionized Ca of 1.76?mmol/L, iPTH 10?pg/ml, PTHrP 0.7?pg/ml. Medical management with intravenous fluids and furosemide showed no improvement in renal failure, or calcium level. Patient was then started on hemodialysis with 2.0?mmol/L calcium in the dialysate the next day. There was gradual improvement in patient's mental status, calcium values, and renal failure over the ensuing 2 weeks. Discussion and Conclusions:? The diagnosis of Milk-Alkali syndrome is made on the basis of history. Metabolic abnormalities involved in this syndrome are hypercalcemia with low to normal PTH and Vit. D levels, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Failed medical management required acute dialysis in this patient. Acute hemodialysis in such a case could be life saving. Due to increasing use of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and osteoporosis, patients should be made aware of these severe, potentially life-threatening adverse effects.

AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.

AB  - Forty-one consecutive admissions to a hemodialysis center were evaluated. Demographic information including age, gender, race, and diagnosis was collected. Patients, >18 years old, with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis for at least one year were included. Those with edema or known ascites were excluded. Weight was measured before and after hemodialysis (HD) using a standard scale and by considering the amount of fluid loss by the hemodialysis machine. Body composition including total body water (TBW) was calculated before and after HD using near infrared interactance (NIR). All measurements were completed during half hour before and after HD. Forty-one patients included: men (n?=?26), women (n?=?15); median age 58 (range 28?88 years). Twenty-eight were African American and the rest Caucasians. The amount of intravascular fluid taken after HD (assessed by weight reduction) ranged 0?5?L with median 2.2?L. NIR analysis for the same patients at the same time showed different total body water measurements in 91% of cases (P?>?0.05). Moreover, NIR analysis showed increase in total body water in 24% of patients even though the hemodialysis machine showed a loss of total body water; median of 1.3 (range: 0?3L). The error in measuring body composition with NIR was both large and varied (random and not systematic error). We conclude that NIR analysis cannot be considered as a reliable method to evaluate body composition, especially total body water, amongst patients with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Purpose:? To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Methods:?Between January 1997 and December 2003, we treated 22 patients with non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas by PTA. Retrospective analysis was performed on the findings of fistulogram, techniques and success rate of PTA, and patency rate. Results:?Seventeen segmental stenoses and 5 segmental occlusions of cephalic veins were identified. Sixteen stenoses and 2 occlusions were located at the cephalic vein adjacent to the anastomosis site, and 3 occlusions and 1 stenosis were seen at the proximal vein near the elbow joint. In addition to venous stenosis, a focal arterial stenosis at the anastomosis site and two accompanying accessory veins that might hamper maturation of main cephalic vein was seen in each of two patients, respectively. Simultaneous occlusion of left innominate vein as well as occlusion of cephalic vein were noted in one patient. Initial success rate of PTA was 95.5%(21/22). Overall success rate including 11 additional PTAs performed during follow-up was 96.9%(32/33). No major complication occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 72% and 95% at 3 months, and 50% and 77% at 6 months, respectively. Conclusion:?PTA is an effective and safe method in salvaging non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of argatroban in a post-cardiac operation patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requiring hemodialysis and continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVH). Case Summary:A 23-year-old Caucasian female with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed acute renal failure after cardiovascular surgery. Argatroban was used as a substitute for heparin during hemodialysis and CVVH. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) were used to guide the dosage of argatroban. The patient was successfully dialyzed without clotting of the circuit. The dosage required in our patient was much lower than the manufacturer's recommendation. Discussion:Argatroban is a thrombin inhibitor that does not cross react with heparin. It is metabolized by the liver, and dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The correct dosage for patient with unstable hemodynamics is not known. Our patient had apparently normal hepatic function at the initiation of dialysis, but the dosage of argatroban recommended by the manufacturer resulted in prolonged elevation of the aPTT and ACT with associated gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to hepatic congestion secondary to poor cardiac function and/or severe anasarca. And the dosage of argatroban required during dialysis was much lower than the recommendation. Conclusions:Argatroban is an effective alternative of heparin for CVVH. The correct initial dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment and unstable hemodynamics is still unclear.

AB  - Several types of high flux dialyzers were developed and introduced for clinical applications to improve solute removal efficiency. In these dialyzers, internal filtration/backfiltration (IF/BF) is induced by pressure drop of blood and dialysate flow in a countercurrent manner under less net filtration. Higher IF/BF flow rate increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. In previously published papers, we reported the effects of IF on solute removal efficiency of the dialyzer during an analytical and an experimental study and the measurement of the internal filtration flow rate (QIF) by Doppler ultrasonography. Average blood flow rate (QBav) at a cross-sectional plane was measured by pulse Doppler and the longitudinal QBav profile along the dialyzer was obtained using a probe slider that can move the probe in parallel along the dialyzer. This is a suitable method for a bedside monitoring of the IF/BF flow rate of dialyzers because it is noninvasive to the patient and produces reliable data with higher reproducibility. Internal backfiltration flow rate (QBF) in six types of commercially available high flux dialyzers, having a higher 50?ml/min of ?2-microglobulin clearance (CL-?2?m), were examined by Doppler ultrasonography under 10?ml/min/m2 of net filtration flow rate. As a result, a wide range of QBF value, 12.1?28.4?ml/min, was obtained among those dialyzers. It means a fair amount of BF, 2.9?6.8 liter per session, occurs in a typical hemodialysis treatment. Strict management of dialysate purification is required for a dialyzer with a relatively larger BF. On the other hand, no correlation between the CL-?2?m value and the QBF value was seen because the CL-?2?m value depends on not only the IF/BF flow rate but also diffusive property of the membrane. The BF flow rate in every dialyzer should be examined to avoid suffering from the invasion of endotoxin and its fragment for safety.

AB  - K/DOQI has set the national standard of adequacy in dialysis. Clinical practice assesses these standards using ?routine? blood work schedules that vary from every 4?6 weeks and calculates these results using different urea kinetic formulas. This variance may result in under-dialysis of our patients that may not be detected until the next routine blood work. Comparing Kt/V blood work results using ?snapshot? laboratory results versus total run trending using Integra Diascan monitoring may help us define adequacy and may identify potential cost savings to the medical system and the hemodialysis patient. Diascan offers more than on-line Kt/V monitoring of clearances; it also reports patient serum plasma conductivity. Serum plasma monitoring helps to identify potential excess fluid gains which may compromise dialysis treatments leading to poor clearances, which in turn leads to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing costly dialysis interventions and potential emergent treatments. The small sampling of patients compared use a variety of vascular accesses and were examined for some of the barriers to effective ?snapshot? monitoring of Kt/V or PRU versus trending adequacy to explore the potential benefits and efficacy of the data obtained.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - Occult HCV infection in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis (anti-HCV, serum HCV RNA negative) and no renal diseases, has been reported (1). In this work we studied the existence of occult HCV infection in PBMC of HD patients. Inclusion criteria: high ALT (>28?IU/l) and/or gamma-GPT levels, negative serological HCV and HBV markers (anti-HCV, serum HCV-RNA and HBsAg negative), and exclusion of other causes of liver damage. Four Spanish HD units participated in the study and 40 patients were enrolled; 40 (25 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. HCV-RNA in PBMC was tested by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. Occult HCV infection was found in 24/40 (60%) patients by RT-PCR and all cases were confirmed by in situ hybridization. No differences were found regarding gender, etiology of renal disease, or fluctuant or persistent abnormal liver enzymes values. Among patients with occult HCV infection, 4/24 (16.7%) had only increased ALT levels; 7/24 (29.2.%) GGTP values; and both enzymes were elevated in 13/24 (54.2%). In our population, 60% HD patients with persistent or fluctuant ALT and/or GGTP values of unknown etiology and negative for serological viral markers (including serum HCV-RNA) have an occult HCV infection in PBMC and these patients could be potentially infectious.

AB  - Control of certain clinical and laboratory parameters affects morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) both before and after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). To identify areas and stage of renal failure where control of these critical variables needs improvement, we compared important clinical and laboratory parameters 6 months before (PRE) and 6 months after starting HD (POST) in 43 type 2 diabetic men with CRF, who were 69.3?±?10.7 years old at HD initiation. Differences, all at p?≤?0.05, were found in blood pressure, in mm Hg, at the physician's office, both systolic (PRE 154?±?16, POST 138?±?18) and diastolic (PRE 77?±?13, POST 69?±?11), serum cholesterol in mg/dL (PRE 206?±?61, POST 159?±?40), and serum creatinine in mg/dL (PRE 4.1?±?1.3, POST 7.0?±?1.8), while no differences were noted in blood hematocrit (PRE 36?±?7%, POST 34?±?9%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin (PRE 7.4?±?1.7%, POST 6.9?±?2.3%), serum glucose in mg/dL (PRE 151?±?67, POST 184?±?94), serum phosphorus in mg/dL (PRE 4.5?±?0.8, POST 4.6?±?1.5), serum calcium in mg/dL (PRE 8.7?±?0.5, POST 8.5?±?1.4), and serum albumin in g/dL (PRE 3.2?±?0.5, POST 3.4?±?0.6). Compared to the POST category, significantly (p?≤?0.05) higher percentages were found in the PRE category for systolic blood pressure >150?mm Hg (PRE 58.8%, POST 26.5%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin >8%(PRE 33.3%, POST 13.3%), serum cholesterol >200?mg/dL (PRE 48.4%, POST 19.4%). A lower percentage was found in the PRE category for serum phosphorus >5.5?mg/dL (PRE 13.2%, POST 31.6%), while the corresponding percentages for serum albumin <3.0?g/dL (PRE 21.6%, POST 18.9%) and serum calcium <8?mg/dL (PRE 7.9%, POST 13.2%) did not differ. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal failure, control of blood pressure, glycemia, and serum lipids appears to be better; whereas, control of serum phosphorus is worse in the first year after starting chronic hemodialysis than in the preceding year. There is room for improvement, both before and after hemodialysis initiation, in the control of these variables, which affect the clinical outcomes of hemodialysis.

AB  - Background:? Radon is a natural radioactive element found especially in drilled water wells. It may cause problems in HHD. In this study the occurrence and prevention of radiation exposure to radon among HHD patients was examined. Material and methods:?Since 1998, 103 patients have been trained for HHD and drilled wells were used in 7 patients. Apart from routine analyses, radon concentration was also determined. Results:?High radon concentration was observed in three drilled wells, in one of these 2000?Bq/L. Water was conducted into the HHD-equipment through a charcoal filter and reverse osmosis equipment. Radon concentration was less than 50?Bq/L in the purified water. It was thus considered acceptable for dialysis. As the charcoal filter adsorbs radon, its decay products build up in the filter and emit gamma radiation. Considering that the daily through-put of water is about 375 liters, the estimated dose rate for a radon concentration of 1,000?Bq/L is 0.4?microSv/h at one-meter distance. At this distance the annual dose would be 1.8?mSv, expecting a daily occupancy time of 12 hours. The average background gamma dose rate in Finnish dwellings is 0.1?microSv/h. National dose constraints of 3?mSv/year for adults and 1?mSv/year for children living in HHD-households have been recommended. Conclusions: Waterborne radon must be considered when planning of HHD in households where drilled wells are used. Elevated radon concentration should always be removed from household water. In addition, external gamma radiation from charcoal filters requires appropriate restrictions in order to achieve a safe treatment.

AB  - The analysis of infectious complications in patients after allotransplantation of a donor kidney. For the dynamic analysis of frequency of infection-purulent complications, all patients were divided into 2 groups. The first, control group included 33 patients who were operated from 2000 to 2002 (men-21, women-12, adults-28, children-5). The second, basic group included 35 patients (men-22 and women-13, adult-28, children-7), after allotransplantations, which have transferred operation?transplantations of kidney with 2003 on 2004. In the first group purulent?septic complications were marked at 9 patients (27.2%), from them two (6%) have died of a sepsis on a background of antibacterial therapy (cephalosporini 3 generations). Duration of treatment made from 7 up to 15 days. In the second group in the postoperative period purulent ? septic complications were marked at 5 of 35 patients (14,2%). All 35 patients in the second group after allotransplantation of a donor kidney carried out preventive antibacterial therapy maxipimi (cephalosporini IV generations) on dosage 1 gram 2 times per day in a combination with amykini intravenously during 7 days. Cases of development of sepsis in this group of patients were not observed. Thus, estimating the received results, it is possible to draw the conclusion, application of antibiotics of a wide spectrum (cephalosporini IV generations) the patient with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency after allotransplantation of a donor kidney were lowered with quantity of suppurations of postoperative wounds and occurrence of infectious complications on 13%.

AB  - Objective:? Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single pool Kt/V at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. This study was performed to investigate the effect of increasing dialysis needle size on dialysis adequacy in HD patients. Methods:?This study enrolled 73 patients receiving HD thrice weekly for more than 3 months with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft in a single center. Dialysis blood flow rate was 200?ml/min in 12 patients, 250?ml/min in 32 patients, and 300?ml/min in 29 patients. Surface area of dialyzer was 1.2?m2 in 56 patients and 1.6?m2 in 17 patients. We first performed HD using a 16-gauge needle. Then we increased needle size up to 15-gauge without change of any other dialysis conditions such as blood and dialysate flow rates, dialysis time, or distance between needle insertion sites. We compared compression time after removing the needles, venous dialysis pressure (VDP), Kt/V, and urea reduction ratio (URR) between these two methods. Results:?The mean age was 54?±?13 years and the number of patients with diabetes mellitus was 27 (37%). Fifty-eight patients (79.5%) have native AVF. Mean Kt/V at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (1.30?±?0.18 vs. 1.23?± 0.18, p?<?0.001). URR at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was also higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle. In contrast, VDP at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was lower than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (88?±?22?mmHg vs. 118?±?28?mmHg, p?<?0.001). There was no difference in compression time between the two methods. Conclusion:?This study suggests that increasing dialysis needle size is a safe and effective method in improving dialysis adequacy without increasing blood flow rate or dialysis time.

AB  - Objective:? We report a patient with urosepsis, Lleptospira syndrome, TTP-HUS syndrome, fulminant hepatic failure, vasculitis syndrome and TSS treated with plasma component exchange. Methods:?Conditions for plasma component exchange were membrane plasma separator (Evacure EC-3A), substitute fluid (3?% albumin solution), blood flow rate (150?mL/min), filtration rate (30?mL/min), quantity of substitute fluid (4,600?mL) and anticoagulant (nafamostat mesilate 30?mg/hr). Result: Plasma component exchange in combination with hemodiafiltration induced a rapid remission of both hepatic toxicity and renal failure caused by streptococcal sepsis. Membrane plasma separator evacure EC-3A allowed the use of 3% albumin solution as substitute fluid. Colloid osmotic pressure temporarily increased after the treatment, but within 24 hours, returned to the same level as before the treatment. Conclusion:?Plasma component exchange using a membrane plasma separator may allow the use of albumin instead of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as substitute fluid, which results in a lower risk of infection.

AB  - To overcome problems of insufficient clearance, multiple dialyzers may be placed in series or in parallel. The present study aimed to investigate in vitro the overall clearance of small molecules in different dialyzer configurations in which mutual flow directions were changed. Single pass tests were performed with low flux Fresenius F6HPS dialyzers placed in series (12 tests), in parallel (6) and in single use (2). As blood substitute, either high concentrated (45?mS) bicarbonate dialysate (AB solution ? MW20-180) or a trisodiumphosphate (Na3PO4? MW395) concentration (30?mS) was used. Standard blood and dialysate flows of 250 and 500?mL/min, respectively, were applied. Furthermore, clearance was derived from conductivity measurements in the inlet and outlet bloodline, correcting for the overall ultrafiltration rate of 0.5?L/h (AB) and 0.1?L/h (Na3PO4). Compared to the standard setup using a single dialyzer with counter current flows, clearance increases by 3 to 8%(AB) and by 15 to 18%(Na3PO4) using two dialyzers in parallel and in series, respectively. With co-current flows in a serial dialyzer set up, clearance increases by 16%(AB) and 22%(Na3PO4) compared to the single dialyzer use. Changing subsequently the counter current flows to co-current in one and both dialyzers in series, the overall clearance decreases by 2 to 9%, respectively, for the AB solution, and by 8 to 15% for the Na3PO4 concentration. With respect to the parallel dialyzer setup, a split dialysate flow (250?mL/min in each dialyzer) counter current to the blood flow, increases the clearance by 4 and 12%, respectively. In conclusion, overall clearance is most ameliorated using two dialyzers in series with counter current flows.

AB  - The incidence of active tuberculosis among patients on long- term dialysis is higher than the rate in the general population. Case:?39-year-old male patient with ESRD was admitted to hospital with dyspnea, weight loss, cough without sputum and hemoptysis, and a palpable painless mass under the right areola. He was on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for the last six months. PPD was negative. Chest X-ray examination revealed a hyperdense lesion. On the computerized tomography a cystic mass at the inferior lobe superior segment near the thorasic vertebra was detected. Fine needle aspiration from each of the mass lesions revealed granulomas and acido-resistant bacteria. Anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated. After eight months he came back with paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the lesion which previously has been described by CT was extending to the spinal duct and pressing on the spinal cord. After a biopsy, granuloma was seen; however, mycobacterium tuberculosis did not grow in the culture. Discussion:?Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in patients with ESRD. In the present case we established that the patient who presented a mass on the chest wall without pulmonary tuberculosis findings had indeed a tuberculous cavity mass. It is interesting to note that in this case this mass had no relationship to the tuberculous cavity in the lung tissue. Moreover, it is also interesting that paraspinal lesion occured during the period in which the patient was under treatment and it quickly progressed and led to paraplegia. Tissue biopsy with invasive procedures may be necessary. Thus, in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, renal patients in high-risk group (renal transplant recipients, hemodialysis and CAPD patients) should be examined periodically to exclude silent infection and reduce morbidity and mortality.
