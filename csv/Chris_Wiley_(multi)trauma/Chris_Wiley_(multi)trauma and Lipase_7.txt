AB  - Summary Pancreas donor selection and recognition are important to cope with increasing organ shortage. We aim to show that the PDRI is more useful than the P-PASS to predict acceptance and should thus be preferred over P-PASS. Eurotransplant donors from 2004 until 2014 were included in this study. PDRI logistical factors were set to reference to purely reflect donor quality (PDRI donor). PDRI and P-PASS association with allocation outcome was studied using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Regional differences in donor quality were also investigated. Of the 10 444 pancreata that were reported, 6090 (58.3%) were accepted and 2947 (28.2%) were transplanted. We found that P-PASS was inferior to PDRIdonor in its ability to predict organ reporting, acceptance, and transplantation: AUC 0.63, 0.67 and 0.73 for P-PASS vs. 0.78, 0.79 and 0.84 for PDRIdonor, respectively. Furthermore, there were significant differences in donor quality among different Eurotransplant countries, both in reported donors and in transplanted organs. PDRI is a powerful predictor of allocation outcome and should be preferred over P-PASS. Proper donor selection and recognition, and possibly a more liberal approach toward inferior quality donors, may increase donation and transplant rates.

AB  - Pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide sharp surge during the past decade. Pancreatitis includes acute and chronic subtypes, which are graded based on the amount of pancreatic inflammation. Phytoconstituents represent a promising class of therapeutic agents with wide acceptability not only based on folk practices but sound presence of pharmacological and molecular evidences. Growing research evidence indicates that different molecular mechanisms are involved in their protective effect. Many phytoremedies have been tried for the treatment of pancreatic injuries and have shown success in preclinical animal models of pancreatitis. The literature was largely collected through PubMed and Google scholar database. A large proportion of phytochemicals targets the inflammatory cascade and modulates the overtly acting redox balance among which nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells is the key molecule. Inhibition of apoptosis (artemisinin, embelin), inflammasome (withaferin A), neutrophil rolling (fucoidan), Ca+2 release (caffeine), mitogen activated protein kinase (guggulsterone) and many other novel mechanisms apart from antioxidant effect have been postulated behind the protective effect of phytoconstituents. The present review deals to fill the gap of hitherto unavailable comprehensive review on various plant products screened for the treatment of pancreatitis. The possible mechanistic profile of these phytochemicals is summarized. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background:? A major complication of a distal pancreatectomy (DP) is the formation of a post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF). In spite of the utilization of numerous surgical techniques no consensus on an appropriate technique for closure of the pancreatic remnant after DP has been established yet. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of pancreatoenteral anastomosis (PE) vs. direct closure (DC) of the pancreatic remnant on POPF. Methods:? A total of 198 consecutive patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy between 2002 and 2010 at our institution were retrospectively analysed for post-operative morbidity and mortality. Results:? One hundred and fifty-one patients (76.3%) received DC whereas PE was performed in 47 patients (23.7%). The incidence of POPF was higher in the DC group (22% vs. 11%), whereas the rate of post-operative haemorrhage was higher in the PE group (11% vs. 7%). However, these differences were not significant. Additionally, there were no significant differences in overall post-operative morbidity and mortality between the groups. Conclusions:? The performance of PE instead of DC may be considered as a safe alternative in individual patients, but it does not significantly lead to a general improvement in post-operative outcome after DP. An interdisciplinary collaboration in the prevention and treatment of POPF therefore remains essential.

AB  - Abstract Natural and synthetic materials have been developed to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix properties for tissue regeneration and reconstruction. On account of the excellent biological and mechanical properties, diverse decellularized tissue materials have been developed as natural scaffolds. Among them, decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has generated great interest in recent years due to the extensiveness of the source and the eximious potential to enhance the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. In this review, we compared the different physical, chemical, and biological treatment in recorded decellularization methods, and illustrated the similarities and differences in the characteristics of various aspects of DATs prepared by different methods, including macroscopic (macro) and microcosmic (micro) structure, cellular contents removal, DNA quantification, collagen, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or growth factors retention, and mechanical properties. We also summarized the DAT application in the studies of tissue regeneration, wound healing, drug screening, and other diseases. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aim: Recurrent bleeding after initial haemostasis in peptic ulcer haemorrhage is an important factor that directly related to increased mortality. Conflicting reports have been published concerning the effectiveness of scheduled repeat endoscopy on ulcer rebleeding. We investigate the use of scheduled repeat endoscopy with subsequent further therapy in peptic ulcer bleeding. Method: From August 1999 to January 2001, we prospectively randomized patients who had endoscopically confirmed bleeding peptic ulcer with stigmata of acute bleeding, visible vessel or adherent clot into two groups. Endoscopic therapy was standardized to be adrenaline injection and heater probe application. One group received scheduled second endoscopy 16?24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis (Group A), and further therapy applied if endoscopic stigmata persist as above. The other group received close observations (Group B). Those patients in the two groups that develop rebleeding will receive operation if further endoscopic therapy failed. The outcome measures include ulcer re-bleeding, transfusion, length of stay, and mortality. Results: After initial endoscopic haemostasis, 196 patients were randomized to two groups. 2 patients were excluded after randomization as pathology confirmed carcinoma of stomach. The results were analyzed by using either Chi square or student t tests. Conclusion: A scheduled repeat endoscopy with appropriate therapy 16 to 24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis reduce the amount of peptic ulcer rebleeding siginificantly.

AB  - There were 143 patients operated for facial fracture in the Prince of Wales Hospital during the period from February 1997 to December 2000. Out of 143 patients, 44 were operated for orbital floor fracture. The average age of the patients was 35. The male to female ratio is 5:1. Road traffic accident and assault are the main cause of injury. Diplopia was presented in 16% of all the cases. The average time lag between admission and operation is 92 hours. The average operating time is 75 minutes. All of them underwent orbital floor exploration with 86% had the orbital floor reconstructed with either titanium mesh, silastic-mesh or medpor. The mean hospital stay was 10.2 days. The timing of operation, indications of pre-op CT scan, surgical access and outcome will be presented.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate prospectively the usefulness of routine drainage of the neck following thyroid surgery and its effect on patient comfort. Method: Consecutive patients who underwent elective thyroid surgery were randomized to receive suction drainage or no drainage of the neck at the end of the operation. Drains were removed on the first postoperative day and all patients underwent sonographic examination of the neck to determine the dimension of the remaining haematoma. Pain relating to the operation was assessed at 6 hours post operation and on Day 1 by visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain caused by drain removal was also assessed similarly. Postoperative complications and the lengths of hospital stay were also recorded. Results: 60 patients were recruited and randomized, an equal number of patients with similar demographic characteristics were present in each group. The table below shows a summary of the results. The mean pain score for pain caused by drain removal was 3.1 (range: 0?6). There was no difference for complication rate and the postoperative lengths of hospital stay for the two groups. Conclusion: Routinely draining the neck for thyroid surgery not only failed to reduce the amount of postoperative haematoma and complication but also resulted in greater patient discomfort. Drains should therefore not be used routinely following thyroid surgery.

AB  - Introduction: External ventricular drains (EVD) are used for intracranial pressure monitoring and temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage in neurosurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid infection is the major complication. Previous prospective epidemiological study from Mayhall (1) had recommended that the EVD should be changed every 5 days to reduce CSF infection. However, subsequent different retrospective series had yielded conflicting results. Hypothesis: The aim was to test whether the practice of exchange of EVD every five days could reduce the CSF infection rate and subsequently improve outcome in terms of ICU stay, hospital stay, 3-month outcome and mortality. Method: We carried out a randomized controlled clinical trial between 11/1998 and 11/2000. 103 patients who needed EVD for more than 5 days and had no evidence of CSF infection on presentation were included. The patients were randomized between change (every five days) and no change of external ventricular drain. Results: Conclusion: The practice of regular exchange of EVD did not reduce CSF infection rate and did not improve outcome. This is in agreement with the current thinking that CSF infection mainly originated from the procedure of ventriculostomy. The associated high cost with regular exchange of EVD (operations and new catheters) did not seem to be justified. Thus, the practice of regular exchange of EVD should be abandoned.

AB  - The objective of the study is to find out the efficiency of video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis and predisposing factors of postoperative complications. This is a retrospective study that those who had VATS pleurodesis from January 1994 to December 2000 were recruited. There were consecutive 306 VATS pleurodesis performed on 271 patients. These included 33 female and 238 male patients from 15 to 73 years old. 31 of them had bilateral procedures. 244 of them had primary spontaneous pneumothoraces and 27 of them had secondary pneumothoraces. Most of them had two or more episodes of pneumothoraces and persistent air leakage >14 days before operations. 15 patients had failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before VATS. There was no operative death. Usually they were discharged within five days after operations. There were 21 persistent air leakage >5 days (6.8%), 1 bleeding required surgical haemostasis (0.3%) and 4 infectious complications (1.3%). Follow up duration was up to 72 months. There was 12 recurrence (3.9%) after discharge. Absence of blebs, presence of pleural adhesion, prolonged chest tube placement before VATS pleurodesis, and failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before are the predisposing factors of complications.

AB  - Introduction: Image-detected breast lesion is becoming a concern in surgery. After triple assessment, a suspicious or indeterminate lesion will usually require excision to rule out malignancy. Vacuum-assisted biopsy is newly introduced as a minimally invasive alternative to operation in obtaining tissue for histological assessment. The early experience of this procedure in the Breast Centre of Kwong Wah Hospital is reviewed. Method: Vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed for image-detected breast lesions under local anaesthesia using the Mammotome. Lesions were either vaguely palpable or non-palpable but well seen on ultrasound scan with fine needle aspirated indeterminate cytology or benign cytology in a high risk patient. Definitive surgery was performed if the biopsy result showed malignancy or upon patient?s request. Other patients were followed up six monthly with clinical examination and ultrasound scan. Excision was indicated if there was any increase in size. The pathology was assumed to be benign if there was no change in six months time. Result: From September 1998 to May 2000, 49 female patients were included. One of them had 2 lesions making a total of 50 cases. The mean age of the patients was 45.5 (22?58). The mean size of the lesion was 10.8mm (4?19). The procedure took 5?55 min (mean 16.6). It was successful in 49 cases (98%). Four lesions were found to be malignant. Three patients had definitive operations with the pathology confirmed while one patient defaulted follow up. Amongst the 45 benign lesions, 3 were excised upon request. The pathology were all benign. For the remaining 42 patients. 23 were followed up for 12 months and 19 patients for 6 months. Three patients were found to have enlarging lesions and excisions were performed which revealed benign histology. The breast lumps of the remaining 39 patients either remained unchanged or diminished size. There were no major complications (wound haematoma, infection). The average linear pain score (minimum 1, maximum 5) was 2.0. Conclusion: Vacuum-assisted biopsy is an accurate diagnostic tool with the advantage of minimal morbidity.

AB  - Controversies still exist as to the exact definition of phimosis, true indications for circumcision, and results of different treatment options. A prospective study in the two years straddling the Millennium was done to definite the exact role of circumcision in the management of the preputial problems amid continuing controversies and in the wake of a new medical treatment, i.e. steroid application emerging since 1993. 244 referrals resulted in 195 circumcisions in 1999. Detailed analysis revealed that the indication was doubtful and arguable in 13.5% and 16%, respectively. The overall complication rate (bleeding, infection and rephimosis) occurred in 12%. Starting from 2000, application of 0.02% Trimcinolone cream was instituted: successful retraction in 74 was achieved in 81/95 patients. No side effects were noted. The positive predicting factors were identified. Circumcision has been advocated as a routine to decrease the incidence of UTI, STD or Cancer. However, circumcision is fraught with early and late problems. There have only been 9 reported on the use of steroid application, all using potent preparations. We pioneered the use of a much weaker steroid that was documented to have comparable efficacy. Our proposed algorithm for offers great advantages, including tremendous savings to the hospital, and lifetime benefits to the patients!

AB  - Aim: To review the practice and implications of performing computed tomography (CT) for patients with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. Methods: Patients admitted for RIF pain between July 1998 to April 2000 were classified clinically as having appendicitis, equivocal appendicitis or other conditions. They would all undergo CT abdomen and then managed accordingly. The accuracy of clinical and CT diagnosis were compared, with histology of the resected appendix as gold standard. Results: There were 348 patients with RIF pain and 201 of them underwent CT abdomen. Appendicitis was diagnosed clinically in 45 patients, the remaining patients were either equivocal or suspicious of other conditions. From CT abdomen 82 were diagnosed to be appendicitis and 119 were found to be normal or having other pathology. For those with radiological appendicitis, 74 were proven on histology (sensitivity = 85%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 90% (74/82)). Within the clinical appendicitis group, 37 were confirmed by histology (PPV of clinical diagnosis = 82% (37/45)). Among the equivocal group, 50 patients turned out to be appendicitis. Conclusion: Although CT is useful in diagnosing appendicitis, we do not recommend routine CT abdomen for patients with RIF pain as no significant additional benefit is seen in the group of patients with clinical appendicitis. However, there may be a role for it in patients with equivocal clinical features but a randomized clinical trial is needed for further evaluation.

There were 15 male and 10 female patients. Age ranged from 11 to 84 years old (median 56). Pathology involving the mandible included 18 squamous cell carcinoma, five radiation-induced sarcoma, one radionecrosis and one ameloblastoma. After surgical ablation, all these oromandibular defects were reconstructed using free fibular flaps with closing wedge osteotomies and double-miniplates fixation. Concerning the fibular flaps, there were one straight osteal flap, 12 osteo-cutaneous flaps, and 13 composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps. Among the composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps, there were eight stacked bone flaps, three double skin islands composite flaps and two double muscles composite flaps. Hospital mortality of these advanced cancer patients was 7.7%. Success rate of free fibular graft was 96.2%. There was one total loss (3.8%), two flaps skin necrosis (7.7%) and three re-operations for major complications (11.5%). Minor complications that included wound infection and self-limited salivary fistula was 23%. The additional craftsmanship for the complex oromandibular reconstruction required careful three-dimensional planning and meticulous protection of individual components of the osteomyo-cutaneous flaps so as to restore the lower face with form and function.

AB  - Neurosurgical service requires team work and highly specialized resources. Acute neurosurgical emergencies are traditionally referred from district general hospital (DGH) to the Neurosurgical Unit (NSU) by telephone consultation. Initial experience had proved that tele-radiology could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary transfer but clinical outcome improvement was not demonstrated.(1) We compare the traditional telephone consultation with tele-radiology. Patients with acute neurosurgical conditions in a DGH need consultation to NSU were included. These patients were divided into Head Injury, Stroke and Miscellaneous groups. They were further randomized to telephone or tele-radiology consultation mode in different groups. There were totally 375 patients recruited and randomized from the period between 1 October 1998 to 30 June 2000. The time requested for referral to decision made were 35 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, but similar in head injury subgroup. The total numbers of patient needed transfer to PWH were fewer in tele-radiology group (telephone: 80 vs. tele-radiology: 61). The diagnostic accuracy was also higher in tele-radiology group due to the visual aids from the transferred image. The overall outcome assessed on 6 months and showed that patients in tele-radiology group have better outcome score. In summary, this is a first randomized control study to confirm clinical benefits of tele-radiology on managing inter-hospital neurosurgical patients.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of choice for breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy or in selected case breast conserving surgery. Typically, patient will have a long hospital stay after surgery due to the collection of lymph. Premature removal of drain will incur seroma formation and may predispose to wound infection. Review of literature shows that there has not been adequate address to this condition, particularly the use of pressure garment in reducing lymph output. We report our experience in an interim analysis of a randomized controlled study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of pressure garment on early removal of drains, shortening of hospital stay and reducing the incidence of seroma formation. Methodology: From September 1999 to November 2000, 44 consecutive patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer were invited to participate in this study. Our occupational therapist arranged for tailor made pressure garments. Soft foam mimicking the external mammary prosthesis was fashioned so that appropriate pressure was applied on to the operative site to prevent lymph accumulation. They were randomized into two groups (1) with pressure garment (2) without pressure garment. The single surgeon performing the mastectomy was blinded until the completion of surgery when the result of randomization was sought from the principal investigator. The occupational therapist inspected daily to ensure the vest was filled satisfactorily. OPD assessments were arranged at 2 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: (range in parentheses) Conclusion: Use of breast pressure garment did not prevent seroma formation but reduced the volume of drainage and facilitated early removal of drains resulting in a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay of 2.7 days. Such breast vest has great impact on the hospital economy.
