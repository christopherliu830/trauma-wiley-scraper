AB  - The objective of the study is to find out the efficiency of video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis and predisposing factors of postoperative complications. This is a retrospective study that those who had VATS pleurodesis from January 1994 to December 2000 were recruited. There were consecutive 306 VATS pleurodesis performed on 271 patients. These included 33 female and 238 male patients from 15 to 73 years old. 31 of them had bilateral procedures. 244 of them had primary spontaneous pneumothoraces and 27 of them had secondary pneumothoraces. Most of them had two or more episodes of pneumothoraces and persistent air leakage >14 days before operations. 15 patients had failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before VATS. There was no operative death. Usually they were discharged within five days after operations. There were 21 persistent air leakage >5 days (6.8%), 1 bleeding required surgical haemostasis (0.3%) and 4 infectious complications (1.3%). Follow up duration was up to 72 months. There was 12 recurrence (3.9%) after discharge. Absence of blebs, presence of pleural adhesion, prolonged chest tube placement before VATS pleurodesis, and failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before are the predisposing factors of complications.

AB  - Introduction: Image-detected breast lesion is becoming a concern in surgery. After triple assessment, a suspicious or indeterminate lesion will usually require excision to rule out malignancy. Vacuum-assisted biopsy is newly introduced as a minimally invasive alternative to operation in obtaining tissue for histological assessment. The early experience of this procedure in the Breast Centre of Kwong Wah Hospital is reviewed. Method: Vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed for image-detected breast lesions under local anaesthesia using the Mammotome. Lesions were either vaguely palpable or non-palpable but well seen on ultrasound scan with fine needle aspirated indeterminate cytology or benign cytology in a high risk patient. Definitive surgery was performed if the biopsy result showed malignancy or upon patient?s request. Other patients were followed up six monthly with clinical examination and ultrasound scan. Excision was indicated if there was any increase in size. The pathology was assumed to be benign if there was no change in six months time. Result: From September 1998 to May 2000, 49 female patients were included. One of them had 2 lesions making a total of 50 cases. The mean age of the patients was 45.5 (22?58). The mean size of the lesion was 10.8mm (4?19). The procedure took 5?55 min (mean 16.6). It was successful in 49 cases (98%). Four lesions were found to be malignant. Three patients had definitive operations with the pathology confirmed while one patient defaulted follow up. Amongst the 45 benign lesions, 3 were excised upon request. The pathology were all benign. For the remaining 42 patients. 23 were followed up for 12 months and 19 patients for 6 months. Three patients were found to have enlarging lesions and excisions were performed which revealed benign histology. The breast lumps of the remaining 39 patients either remained unchanged or diminished size. There were no major complications (wound haematoma, infection). The average linear pain score (minimum 1, maximum 5) was 2.0. Conclusion: Vacuum-assisted biopsy is an accurate diagnostic tool with the advantage of minimal morbidity.

AB  - Aim: To review the practice and implications of performing computed tomography (CT) for patients with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. Methods: Patients admitted for RIF pain between July 1998 to April 2000 were classified clinically as having appendicitis, equivocal appendicitis or other conditions. They would all undergo CT abdomen and then managed accordingly. The accuracy of clinical and CT diagnosis were compared, with histology of the resected appendix as gold standard. Results: There were 348 patients with RIF pain and 201 of them underwent CT abdomen. Appendicitis was diagnosed clinically in 45 patients, the remaining patients were either equivocal or suspicious of other conditions. From CT abdomen 82 were diagnosed to be appendicitis and 119 were found to be normal or having other pathology. For those with radiological appendicitis, 74 were proven on histology (sensitivity = 85%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 90% (74/82)). Within the clinical appendicitis group, 37 were confirmed by histology (PPV of clinical diagnosis = 82% (37/45)). Among the equivocal group, 50 patients turned out to be appendicitis. Conclusion: Although CT is useful in diagnosing appendicitis, we do not recommend routine CT abdomen for patients with RIF pain as no significant additional benefit is seen in the group of patients with clinical appendicitis. However, there may be a role for it in patients with equivocal clinical features but a randomized clinical trial is needed for further evaluation.

AB  - A consecutive series of 26 free fibular flaps in 25 patients performed by the Division of Plastic Surgery in Kwong Wah Hospital between 1995?2000 was presented. There were 15 male and 10 female patients. Age ranged from 11 to 84 years old (median 56). Pathology involving the mandible included 18 squamous cell carcinoma, five radiation-induced sarcoma, one radionecrosis and one ameloblastoma. After surgical ablation, all these oromandibular defects were reconstructed using free fibular flaps with closing wedge osteotomies and double-miniplates fixation. Concerning the fibular flaps, there were one straight osteal flap, 12 osteo-cutaneous flaps, and 13 composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps. Among the composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps, there were eight stacked bone flaps, three double skin islands composite flaps and two double muscles composite flaps. Hospital mortality of these advanced cancer patients was 7.7%. Success rate of free fibular graft was 96.2%. There was one total loss (3.8%), two flaps skin necrosis (7.7%) and three re-operations for major complications (11.5%). Minor complications that included wound infection and self-limited salivary fistula was 23%. The additional craftsmanship for the complex oromandibular reconstruction required careful three-dimensional planning and meticulous protection of individual components of the osteomyo-cutaneous flaps so as to restore the lower face with form and function.

AB  - Neurosurgical service requires team work and highly specialized resources. Acute neurosurgical emergencies are traditionally referred from district general hospital (DGH) to the Neurosurgical Unit (NSU) by telephone consultation. Initial experience had proved that tele-radiology could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary transfer but clinical outcome improvement was not demonstrated.(1) We compare the traditional telephone consultation with tele-radiology. Patients with acute neurosurgical conditions in a DGH need consultation to NSU were included. These patients were divided into Head Injury, Stroke and Miscellaneous groups. They were further randomized to telephone or tele-radiology consultation mode in different groups. There were totally 375 patients recruited and randomized from the period between 1 October 1998 to 30 June 2000. The time requested for referral to decision made were 35 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, but similar in head injury subgroup. The total numbers of patient needed transfer to PWH were fewer in tele-radiology group (telephone: 80 vs. tele-radiology: 61). The diagnostic accuracy was also higher in tele-radiology group due to the visual aids from the transferred image. The overall outcome assessed on 6 months and showed that patients in tele-radiology group have better outcome score. In summary, this is a first randomized control study to confirm clinical benefits of tele-radiology on managing inter-hospital neurosurgical patients.

AB  - Aim: Recurrent bleeding after initial haemostasis in peptic ulcer haemorrhage is an important factor that directly related to increased mortality. Conflicting reports have been published concerning the effectiveness of scheduled repeat endoscopy on ulcer rebleeding. We investigate the use of scheduled repeat endoscopy with subsequent further therapy in peptic ulcer bleeding. Method: From August 1999 to January 2001, we prospectively randomized patients who had endoscopically confirmed bleeding peptic ulcer with stigmata of acute bleeding, visible vessel or adherent clot into two groups. Endoscopic therapy was standardized to be adrenaline injection and heater probe application. One group received scheduled second endoscopy 16?24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis (Group A), and further therapy applied if endoscopic stigmata persist as above. The other group received close observations (Group B). Those patients in the two groups that develop rebleeding will receive operation if further endoscopic therapy failed. The outcome measures include ulcer re-bleeding, transfusion, length of stay, and mortality. Results: After initial endoscopic haemostasis, 196 patients were randomized to two groups. 2 patients were excluded after randomization as pathology confirmed carcinoma of stomach. The results were analyzed by using either Chi square or student t tests. Conclusion: A scheduled repeat endoscopy with appropriate therapy 16 to 24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis reduce the amount of peptic ulcer rebleeding siginificantly.

AB  - Background: Although prophylatic antibiotics has been proven to be effective in reducing wound complications after appendectomy, the most efficacous dosage remains uncertain. Aim: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotics after appendectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis. Methods: From July 1995 to December 2000, all patients aged between 15 and 70 years with appendectomy performed via a right lower abdominal incision were considered for the study. Exclusion criteria included pre-admission antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, known drug allergy and ruptured appendicitis. Intravenous Cefuroxime, 1.5g, and Metronidazole, 500 mg were given at induction of anaesthesia. After appendectomy, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment protocols: (A) no further antibiotics, (B) 2 more doses of antibiotics, or (C) a 5-day course of antibiotics. Outcomes of surgery were compared using 1-way ANOVA or Chi-square where appropriate. Results: Of 275 patients recruited, 6 had normal appendix revealed by histology and were excluded. Treatment A, B and C were assigned to 92, 94 and 83 patients, respectively. The 3 groups were comparable in demographics and pre-operative characteristics. The outcomes were as follows: Conclusions: A single dose of preoperative antibiotics is adequate for prevention of wound infection in non-perforated appendicitis. Prolonged use of antibiotics is cost-ineffective and may lead to unnecessary complications.

AB  - The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in management of acute cholecystitis remained controversial. Unless contraindicated or refused, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy was offered to patients suffered from acute cholecystitis in our department. Patients data and outcome were collected and analyzed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure and to identify predictive factors for conversion. From January 1999 to December 2000, a total of 78 patients with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were operated. 18 patients had immediate open operation due to previous upper abdominal surgery, or presence of septic shock/peritonitis. Laparoscopic cholecystomy (LC) were successful in 41 (68.3%) of the remaining 60 patients and converted in 19 (31.7%). No mortality was found in the successful or attempted laparoscopic group but 3 patients died in the open group, probably due to poorer premorbid state. The successful LC group had the best outcome in terms of shorter postoperative stay (mean 8.2 days) and less complication rate (7.3%). The only statistically significant predictive factor for conversion are WBC count >19 ? 109/L and duration of symptoms of more than 72 hours after onset. Conclusion: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is safe and effective when operated within 72 hours of symptom onset before significant sepsis occur.

AB  - Objectives: The present study was conducted to report the transitions in the practice of laparoscopic cholecsytectomy since the inception of ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to evaluate the contemporary outcomes of day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: Hospital database of patients who underwent cholecystectomies for benign hepatobiliary pathologies were reviewed between 1993 and 1999. Changes in the practice of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and length of hospital stay were analyzed. Causes for unanticipated admission and readmission were evaluated. Results: Of 2891 laparoscopic cholecystectomies recruited in the present study, 888 (31%) were performed as day case and 2003 (69%) were inpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The annual number of ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy increased from 3 (0.6%) in 1993 to 212 (48%) in 1997, which was followed by a plateau in the next 3 years. There was a significant shift of patients who used to stay overnight to same day discharge, accounting for the increment of ambulatory procedures. Twenty-eight (3.2%) patients were admitted overnight after operation because of pain (n = 11), nausea and vomiting (n = 7) and other reasons (n = 10). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a net trend towards ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post-operative pain was the commonest reason for unanticipated admission after operation. Ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy heralds the wave of the future.

AB  - Objective: To study the long-term upper tract complications in patients with ileal conduit urinary diversion following total cystectomy. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all the patients who attended regular follow-up at the Urostoma Clinic of a general hospital in year 1999. 86 patients were available for analysis: male-to-female ratio 2:1, age 24 to 92 (mean 70.6) years, duration of follow-up 1.1 to 28.5 (mean 10.5) years. 87.2% of the patients had had total cystectomy for bladder cancer. Results: Among the 86 patients, the incidences of acute pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis and impairment of renal function were 11.6% (10), 46.5% (40) and 46.5% (40) respectively. Four patients eventually developed end stage renal failure. Presence of acute pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis correlated with subsequent development of renal impairment (p < 0.05). At 5 and 10 years, incidences of hydronephrosis were 19.8% and 32.6% respectively, incidences of renal impairment were 27.9% and 37.2% respectively, and the overall incidences of having either or both of these upper tract complications were 33.7% and 50.0% respectively. Ultrasonography and/or intravenous urography were the first-line investigations to screen for hydronephrosis. Of the 40 patients with hydronephrosis, 25 had non-obstructed ureters as confirmed by contrast studies and DTPA renography, and the other 15 required flexible conduitoscopy?with contrast conduitography, retrograde pyelo-ureterography and/or biopsy?to ascertain the nature of urinary obstruction: mid-conduit stenosis (1), tumour recurrence at anastomosis (1), anastomotic stricture (9) and ureteral stricture (4). One other patient was incidentally found to have TCC in left renal pelvis. Of the 86 patients, 13 had remedial surgical intervention for the complications, including: balloon dilatation of mid-conduit stenosis (1), nephrectomy (5), revision of ileal conduit (5) and conversion to continent cutaneous diversion (2). Conclusions: Ileal conduit urinary diversion resulted in signifi-cant long-term upper tract complications. 50% of the patients developed complications by 10 years. Regular long-term follow-up is mandatory.

AB  - Background: Urodynamic studies like uroflowmetry and pressure flow study can be performed in various postures although the natural posture for male subjects is standing. Difference in posture may affect voiding performance and make comparison of results from different centers difficult. Aim: To evaluate whether posture (sitting and standing) in male patients would significantly affect the parameters of uroflowmetry and voiding efficiency. Patients and Method: This was a prospective randomized study. Consecutive male patients attending outpatient uroflowmetry from June to August 2000 were recruited. Uroflow was performed in sitting and standing posture. In order to eliminate accustomisation, they were randomized into first sitting or first standing. Uroflow parameters like voided volume, residual urine, voiding efficiency, peak and mean flow rate were analysed by 2-tailed paired t-test. Results: There were 74 subjects (first sitting 35, first standing 39) and age was comparable. There was no statistically significant difference among all the parameters with respect to posture. To our surprise there was also no accustomisation effect, probably due to adequate patient instruction. Conclusion: Uroflow parameters and voiding function are the same in sitting or standing position for male subjects.

AB  - Reconstructive procedures of the head and neck aim to repair soft tissue and bony defects while restoring optimal function and cosmesis. The development of microvascular surgery has offered the possibility of free tissue transfer from distant sites to head and neck area. This allows reconstruction of composite defect in one stage. We would like to review a group of patients with various head and neck defects which were reconstructed with microvascular free flap. Between January 1995 and December 2000, seventy nine patients underwent 82 microvascular free flap reconstruction following major head and neck resection. There were 26 fibular, 25 radial forearm, 20 jejunal, 4 lateral arm, 4 rectus abdominus, 2 latissimus dorsi and 1 groin flaps. The majority (95%) of patients had advanced head and neck cancer. The common tumor sites were oral cavity (55%), hypopharynx (23%) and mandible (9%). Three patients (4%) died perioperatively. There were five total flap failure (6%). The overall major morbidity was 17%, including anastomotic leakage, orocutaneous fistula and major wound infection. The general medical complications rate was 17%. Donor site morbidity rate was 11% and the majority were in form of superficial wound infection. Given the good results observed and versatility of free flaps, we concluded that microvascular grafts should be considered in reconstructing head and neck defects following major ablative surgery.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is uncommon in pregnancy but may have a serious impact on maternal and fetal wellbeing. A limited but expanding evidence base provides clinicians a clearer understanding and better management of this disease among the pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is caused by many different factors. While the list of etiologies is extensive, approximately 80 percent of cases are attributable to either biliary tract disease or alcohol abuse in the general population. Cholelithiasis is the most common etiology of pancreatitis in pregnancy, representing a larger percentage of cases than in the non-pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is subdivided into two types: interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. Treatment of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant individuals. However, additional measures during pregnancy include fetal monitoring and attention to positioning of the mother to avoid compression of the inferior vena cava.
