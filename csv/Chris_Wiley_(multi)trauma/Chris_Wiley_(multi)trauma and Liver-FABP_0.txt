AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.
