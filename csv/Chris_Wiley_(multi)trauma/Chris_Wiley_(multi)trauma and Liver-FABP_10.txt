AB  - Background:?? Biologically active factors produced by the intestine and transported by the protein fraction of mesenteric lymph are thought to contribute significantly to the development of distant organ failure in haemorrhagic shock. Despite the likely relevance of the protein composition of mesenteric lymph conditioned by haemorrhagic shock, there is no detailed description of its proteome. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive description of the proteome of haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph. Methods:?? 20 male Wistar rats were randomized to either control or haemorrhagic shock group. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 30?mmHg in the shock group for 90 minutes followed by resuscitation and mesenteric lymph collection for another 90 minutes. Proteomic changes in mesenteric lymph due to haemorrhagic shock were identified using LC-MS/MS. Results:?? 245 proteins were identified in mesenteric lymph, including 35 hypothetical proteins. 60 of the 245 proteins had a significant increase in their relative abundance in the haemorrhagic shock group vs. sham group. Potentially toxic pancreatic enzymes had increased abundance in post-shock mesenteric lymph. In addition, a bioinformatics approach allowed for the identification of key pathways relating to defence and metabolic responses. A number of potentially important proteins were also identified as targets for future research in hemorrhagic shock: peroxiredoxins, 14-3-3 zeta/epsilon, calmodulin, cofilin, and profilin. Conclusions:?? This study not only provides the first comprehensive list of protein changes in the haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph, but also provides rational for future research.

AB  - Purpose:?? Anaesthesia delivery for colonoscopy within HNEAHS is either by an Anaesthetic driven propofol or an Endoscopist supplied sedation service (usually midazolam and fentanyl). The aim of this project is to compare patient satisfaction with respect to these two different modalities of anaesthetic delivery. Methodology:?? All patients undergoing colonoscopy between 1/9/2008 and 30/12/2008 in two endoscopy units (that utilised different sedation services) were surveyed with respect to their pain, recall and satisfaction regarding their anaesthetic delivery. Results:?? 263 out of a potential 735 patients consented prospectively to participation in the survey. Patients undergoing Anaesthetic driven propofol experienced less pain during colonoscopy than those who had Endoscopist supplied sedation (VAS 0.05/10 vs. 1.34/10, p < 0.0001). There was also significantly less recall during the procedure with propofol, and a significantly higher rate of satisfaction with the anaesthetic driven propofol service. There was no difference with respect to recall of events or pain following the procedure. Most importantly a higher proportion of patients who had Anaesthetic driven propofol would either be willing to undergo the procedure again when compared with patients having Endoscopist supplied sedation (99% vs. 95%, p < 0.05), or recommend it to others (100% vs. 92%, p < 0.005). Conclusion:?? An Anaesthetic driven propofol service for colonoscopy provides superior patient satisfaction when compared to Endoscopist supplied sedation.

AB  - Purpose:?? The Apgar score for neonates is well established. Gawande et al (1) recently reported a validated Apgar score for surgery derived for intraoperative parameters (blood loss, lowest heart rate, lowest mean arterial pressure). They studied elective general and vascular surgical patients and demonstrated predictive capability in terms of major complications and death within 30?days. The aim of our study was to determine if the Apgar surgical score was valid and useful in an Australian hospital setting. Methods:?? Elective and emergency surgical procedures over a 31-day period were prospectively studied. The anaesthetic and surgical teams were not aware of the Apgar score. The postoperative course of each patient was reviewed. Primary outcome measures were death or major complications; secondary measures were ICU admission and inpatient length of stay. Results:?? 790 patients were studied and the Apgar score calculated. No correlation was found between Apgar score and complications or death within 30?days. Only 20 (2.5%) had a score of less than 4, and in this group there was 1 death and 6 patients with complications. There were no unplanned ICU admissions. Inpatient length of stay was not shown to be significantly longer in those with lower scores. The Apgar score did not correlate with ASA status. Patients undergoing Caesarean section tended to have poor Apgar scores but excellent outcomes. Conclusion:?? Using the surgical Apgar would not have altered the management of any patient in the study e.g., planning ICU admission etc. and therefore we are unable to recommend its introduction as a routine measure.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - Introduction:?? The goal of an acute general surgical unit (AGSU) is to improve the management of all emergency surgical admissions including those with acute gall bladder disease. In May 2008, John Hunter Hospital Newcastle implemented an AGSU. Changes to service provision included an in-house consultant (7?am to 7?pm) dedicated to acute surgery with access to an afternoon operating list most weekdays. This study compares the management of acute gall bladder disease before and after implementation of the AGSU in the setting of an unchanged policy of operative management during the index admission (where appropriate) for acute gall bladder disease. Method:?? An analysis was performed of all patients admitted via the emergency department with biliary colic or cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical management data and complications were compared for the 6?months of June to November (inclusive) 2007 (pre-AGSU) and 2008 (AGSU). Results:?? In 6?months of 2007, 45 patients were admitted with acute gall bladder disease of which 35 (78%) underwent operative management. By comparison in the same 6?months of 2008, there were 70 admissions, with operative management in 61 (87%). In 2008 average length of stay was 4.24?days (5.07?days in 2007); average time from admission to surgery 34.8?hrs (54.5?hours in 2007, p < 0.05) and, 70.5% of operations occurred between 8?am and 5?pm on a weekday (60% in 2007). Conclusion:?? The provision of an acute gall bladder service is improved within a dedicated acute general surgical unit. This translates to benefits to patients, staff and healthcare economics.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Herniae have been documented since ancient times, but the era of modern hernia treatment is accepted as starting with the surgery of Bassini. Suture repairs of various types then dominated the treatment of hernia until the era of mesh repair championed by Stoppa and Lichtenstein. Surgeons feel that mesh repairs have revolutionized hernia surgery. Have the mesh repairs really made such a difference? There is evidence that all is not as it seems! Published recurrence figures don't seem to withstand close scrutiny. One of the trendy terms in herniology is the ?myo-pectineal orifice?, while many hernia specialists pay lip service to this concept, very few available hernia operations address this problem. The latest area of interest in the world of hernia surgery is the area of post-hernia groin pain, either neuralgic or non-neuralgic. There are studies showing an incidence of chronic groin pain following anterior repairs of 30% or more, and yet these operations are the most common hernia operations in the world! Keith in 1924 first postulated the concept of herniosis and was criticized. However there is a large volume of convincing evidence that herniae are manifestations of a metabolic disorder. They are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm and possibly with such diverse conditions as diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, and perhaps haemorrhoidal disease. Are we there yet? The answer is certainly no. However research into the metabolic problem of hernia development means that we are surely closer than we have ever been before.

AB  - Background:?? The rate of adverse events occurring in Australian hospitals is reported to be up to 12?17%. Adverse events need to be identified, reported and responded to if the system of health care is to be improved. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and nature of adverse events (unintentional harm arising as a result of healthcare) in general surgery in the Geelong Hospital. Method:?? A review was conducted of adverse events in the hospital incident reporting system (Riskman) and general surgical audits between 2004 and 2008. Adverse events were categorised according to severity (1?4) and the hospital response to these events noted. Results:?? There were 888 adverse events arising in 12801 general surgical admissions (6.93%). Their severity assessment codes (SAC) were: catastrophic (0.15%),; major (0.40%),; moderate (2.22%),; and minor (4.30). Some of the complications reported in surgical audits were also adverse events, the major ones being mortality (0.74%), unplanned reoperation (1.27%) and unplanned readmission (1.46%). Identification and tracking of these enabled implementation of system changes. These included a colorectal outcome reporting, PreVENT program (for DVT prophylaxis), review of colonoscopy initiatives, bedside tracheostomy care, and an electronic system to respond to pathology results (TR3). Conclusion:?? The adverse event rates occurring in general surgery at the Geelong Hospital were lower than those previously reported in the literature and may reflect a general improvement in the quality of care during the last decade if these rates are applicable to other hospitals. The hospital response to adverse events has resulted in significant sustainable system changes.

AB  - Introduction:?? The aim of the study was to evaluate whether C reactive protein level (CRP) on admission could aid the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado score in acute appendicitis. Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Aim: 1 Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Webster wound dehiscence (WD) risk scoring system when applied to a population beyond purely a veterans population as in Webster study. 2 Identify additional risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD that was not considered in the Webster study. Method:?? Bi-centre, retrospective case ? control analysis of preoperative and postoperative risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD over seven years (Jan 2000?Dec 2006). 103 patients with abdominal WD were compared to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients with midline laparotomies who were matched to year of operation. Patients were stratified according to the Webster WD risk scoring system and sensitivity and specificity analysis performed. Chi-square analysis was performed on risk factors that were not included in Webster WD Risk scoring model. Results:?? The overall WD rate is 2.8%. (103/3585 patients). Analysis of risk factors that were not considered by the Webster model within the WD group shows peritoneal sepsis (p = 0.04), prolonged ileus (p = 0.006) and current smoking status (p = 0.01) are significant factors associated with patients scoring highly for developing abdominal WD. Conclusions about the sensitivity and specificity of Webster WD risk scoring model can be drawn once control group data are collated. Conclusion:?? Webster WD risk scoring system appears to be a valid tool in identifying patients at high risk for WD. Peritoneal sepsis, prolonged ileus and smoking are associated with high risk of developing abdominal WD.

AB  - Purpose:?? Patients with Gallstone Pancreatitis (GP) have a high risk of choledocholithiasis. MRCP has been recommended by some as the investigation of choice to diagnose choledocholithiasis. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in GP. Methodology:?? Retrospective audit of all presentations of GP between Jan 2001?December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. Data were analysed using univariate analysis and chi-squared test. Results:?? There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis with 243 females and a mean age of 52?years. Overall, 95 cases of choledocholithiasis- as confirmed by ERCP/ Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) ? were diagnosed. The indications for MRCP in this study were heterogeneous. 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4?days of admission with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. ERCP/IOC confirmed 13/15 stones within a median of 2.5?days. MRCPs, however, missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. MRCP sensitivity was 62.0, specificity 97.9. The Positive Likelihood Ratio was 6.5, Negative Likelihood Ratio was 0.1. PPV was 86.7, NPV was 92.0. 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. Conclusion:?? Choledocholithiasis is common in GP. Selective MRCP is highly specific in GP but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.

AB  - Purpose:?? To determine the outcome of patients who had ultrasound detected, but no evidence of clinical correlation. Methodology:?? In a single surgeon practice, all the patients referred by General Practitioners between Aug 2007 to June 2008 with an ultrasound suggesting inguinal hernia, but with no clinical correlation were included. All of them were managed non-surgically. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess the outcome in 16 out the 19 patients eligible for the study. Median follow-up was eight months. Results:?? Pain in the inguinal region was the predominant symptom at presentation. Seven patients had become pain free within two weeks of the initial consultation. The remaining 9 patients had residual pain; 5 patients noticed improvement, 1 patient felt no change and 2 patients had other diagnosis made for their symptoms. No patient chose to see another specialist or had an operation for the management of the initial presentation. Conclusion:?? Fourteen out of sixteen (87.5%) patients who had an ultrasound demonstrating the presence of an inguinal hernia, with no clinical correlation, had improvement or resolution of their pain. This study demonstrates the importance of non surgical management in patients with groin pain and ultrasound detected inguinal hernia but with no clinical correlation.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy has become the procedure of choice for acute appendicitis at our hospital. It provides ideal training in a variety of laparoscopic techniques. It is both safe for patients and good for the community by improving the skills of surgical trainees. Methods:?? We reviewed the prospective audit of one junior registrar's first 150 consecutive cases of laparoscopic appendicectomy, after supervision for the first five cases. Results:?? 150 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy over a period of 27?months. Ages ranged from 14 to 72 with a mean of 28. A standard 3 port technique was used, utilizing mostly suture loops, or occasionally linear staplers to tackle the appendix base. Of 124 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 44 (35%) had perforated, possibly reflecting delay in access to operating theatre in a busy public hospital. Despite this, only two post operative abscesses occurred, and both resolved after percutaneous drains. Hospital stay ranged from 2?7?days (Mean 2, Median 3.5?days). Senior surgical assistance was required in only two patients, once for laparoscopic repair of a serosal tear, and once for conversion for an inflammatory mass subsequently shown to be a carcinoma. Analysis of the cohort in three groups of fifty: early, mid, and late in the series demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both operative time and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the ideal training operation. After some initial supervision the trainees can perform surgery unsupervised and gain experience in a wide variety of surgical techniques. Clinical acumen and operative times improve with experience.

AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.
