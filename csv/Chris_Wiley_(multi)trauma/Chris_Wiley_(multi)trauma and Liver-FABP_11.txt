AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.

AB  - Background:?? The aim is to compare the outcomes of surgical management of large bowel emergencies. The traditional treatment of Hartmann's resection was compared to the new modalities of Colonic stenting for malignant obstruction and laparoscopic washout for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. Methods:?? This paper is a retrospective review of 112 consecutive large bowel emergencies presenting to The Tweed Hospital and John Flynn Private Hospital warranting surgical intervention during the 8?year period 2000?2008. Patients with obstruction from cancer and perforation from diverticulitis were included. Patients with volvulus, pseudo-obstruction, bleeding, stercoral ulceration and prolapse were excluded. Patients with non urgent colonic stenting were also excluded. Results:?? The patient groups were comparable for age, ASA and pathology after exclusions. 57 patients underwent a Hartmann's (obstruction 23, perforation 34) vs. 55 patients undergoing stent for obstruction 21, or washout for perforation 34. Significant differences were observed in the mortality rates, Hartmann's 11/57 (19%) vs. stent and washout 2/55 (37%). Also length of stay: Hartmann's 15?days vs. stent and washout 6?days. Hartmann's was required to salvage 2 failed stents and 6 failed washouts. In 16 of 26 washouts and 11 of 17 stents patients underwent delayed elective resection. Conclusion:?? Patient selection, technical expertise and long learning curve were all aspects that influenced the early results of stenting and washout. Hartmann's is no longer the preferred treatment option for left sided colonic emergencies.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.
