AB  - SUMMARY With the advent of standard flow cytometric methods using two-colour fluorescence on samples of whole blood, it is possible to establish the ranges of CD3. CD 4 and CDS T lymphocyte subsets in the routine laboratory, and also to assist the definition of HIV-1-related deviations from these normal values. In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4% and CD8% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values < 25% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean±s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1·90±0·55, 1·45±0·46, 0·83±0·29 and 0·56± 0·23 ± 109/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4<0·4 ± 109/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were?physiologically? lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations?within persons? were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts <0·4 ± 109/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1·4% and 3%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show <0·4 ± 109/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate a systemic induction of bone formation in rats by immunosuppression with FK506 (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally [ip]) in a model of osteoinduction of isogeneic and xenogeneic demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for a period of 28 days. In particular, alterations of in vitro cytokine synthesis and changes of lymphocyte subsets were studied. DBM was implanted intramuscularly in the abdominal wall of Lewis rats (seven per group). Blood was sampled on days ?7, 0, 7, and 28 for determination of in vitro tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) synthesis and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, ED9+, and Ia+ antibodies). Ossicles of de novo formed bone and the tibias were removed on day 28 after double tetracycline labeling for histomorphometric analysis. Immunosuppression with FK506 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated in vitro cytokine synthesis after 7 days and 28 days (p < 0.05). Compared with control animals FK506 treatment significantly increased the volume of induced bone in isogeneic (2.1 ± 0.3 mm3 vs. 10.8 ± 0.9 mm3) and xenogeneic (0 mm3 vs. 4.7 ± 0.8 mm3) DBM. Bone histomorphometry of the tibias revealed that immunosuppression increased both bone formation and bone resorption, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative trabecular area (Tb.Ar). FK506 caused a decrease in the counts of CD8+ T cells probably because of destruction or dislocation of these cells. This suggests that the amount of CD8+ cells and the degree of T cell activation in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) may be associated with bone metabolism. In support of this, statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between parameters of bone formation as well as bone resorption and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. There was a significant negative correlation between parameters of remodeling of the metaphysis of the tibia and induced bone volume (BV), respectively, and MFI values of CD3+/Ia+ cells. These findings suggest an important role of T lymphocytes in bone formation and bone resorption in vivo. FK506 caused a marked increase of bone formation in DBM. However, the conclusion that immunosuppression increases fracture healing warrants further investigation.

AB  - Summary Multi-systemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED) is a relatively uncommon disease characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of more than one organ system, with the skin and gastrointestinal tract most commonly affected. This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Studies on HIV acquisition and transmission in women exposed to sexual trauma throughout their life cycle are lacking, but some findings suggest that rates of HIV acquisition through coercive sex are significantly higher than that seen in consensual sex. Sexual trauma can also occur as a result of female genital mutilation, which makes sex extremely painful and can cause increased abrasions, lacerations, and inflammation, which enhances the risk of HIV acquisition. This review presents an overview of the immune system in the human female reproductive tract (FRT) from adolescence, through puberty to pregnancy and menopause. What is clear is that the foundation of information on immune protection in the FRT throughout the life cycle of women is extremely limited and at some stages such as adolescence and menopause are grossly lacking. Against this backdrop, forced or coercive sexual intercourse as well as genital mutilation further complicates our understanding of the biological risk factors that can result in transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

AB  - Abstract This Case report illustrates the importance of coordinating various dental specialties in the successful treatment of the traumatized patient. The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT? Aims/Background: The anatomic structure of the liver suggests that it is a place of intense trafficking between intra-hepatic and peripheral blood compartment leukocytes. Furthermore, the liver contains a large number of passenger leukocytes that may play a role in the appearance of donor-type microchimerism after transplantation. In this study, we aimed to define the principal lymphocyte sub-populations contained in donor peripheral blood and liver grafts and in normal liver removed during minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Liver biopsies were taken at the time of vascular clampage during liver extraction from donors in a brain dead state (GI: n=14). Normal liver biopsies were removed during minimaly invasive surgery (GII: n=10). Results: We observed evidence of the presence of lymphocytic activation associated with the two major CD8+ lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell populations in the two groups, with a significant increase in TCR ?δ-bearing lymphocyte receptors between normal liver and the liver graft. Conclusions: The presence of activated leukocytes in the graft could have a fundamental role in induction of peripheral tolerance. This activation could be the result of a basic immunological response linked to the interaction of T cells and NK cells, and of secondary activation due to stress and the conditions necessary for organ removal from donors in a brain dead state.

AB  - Three patients arc reported, each with a reddish macule or plaque (7?10 mm) induced by trauma. The histology of these lesions showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and marked dilation of vessels in the papillary to deep dermis. The electron microscopic study revealed a layer of endothelial cells surrounding the dilated vessels, suggestive of telangiectasia. The relationship between this entity and solitary angiokcratoma is discussed.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the value of different magnetic resonance sequences in the detection of brain lesions in dogs with multi-focal intracranial neurolocalised lesions and abnormal cisternal cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Methods: T2-weighted, T1-weighted, T1-weighted-Gd, FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) images of 73 dogs with multi-focal intracranial localised lesions were reviewed retrospectively. Control dogs (19) were selected on the basis of normal neurological examination, magnetic resonance images and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Two board-certified radiologists blindly reviewed the magnetic resonance images. Magnetic resonance sequence sensitivities were compared using the chi-squared test and logistic regression, accounting for clustering at the patient level. Statistical significance was set at the 5 per cent level. Results: The FLAIR sequence was found to have the highest sensitivity (84 per cent, 61 of 73), followed by T2-weighted (63 per cent, 46 of 73), T1-weighted postcontrast (62 per cent, 45 of 73) and T1-weighted (23 per cent, 17 of 73) (P<0·001). FLAIR images were 106·1 times (95 per cent confidence interval 25·2 to 447·5) more likely to correctly identify cerebrospinal fluid-positive patients than T1-weighted, 6·4 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·2 to 18·2) than T1-weighted postcontrast and 5·8 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·0 to 16·4) than T2-weighted. FLAIR identified 14 per cent of cases that were classified as normal based on the three others sequences. Clinical Significance: Routine use of FLAIR sequence should be encouraged in dogs undergoing a brain magnetic resonance imaging and probably more specifically in cases of suspected inflammatory brain disease.

AB  - We have previously described complement-independent killing of human B lymphocytes by two IgM MoAbs derived from the VH4-34 (VH4.21) gene. Analysis of 17 independently derived VH4-34-encoded MoAbs shows that B cell toxicity is not limited to the two described MoAbs, but is a general property shared by a subset of MoAbs derived from the VH4-34 gene. As observed by two independent microscopy techniques, giant membrane pores were formed on target B cells within 10?15 min of exposure to cytotoxic VH4-34-derived MoAbs. Toxicity by individual MoAb correlated directly to its B cell binding intensity measured by FACS, i.e. stronger the binding greater the killing. Sequence analysis showed that VH region in germ-line or in near germ-line configuration was necessary but not sufficient for B cell binding. In addition, a particular sequence motif enriched in basic amino acids in the CDR3 may be required to supplement the reactivity mediated by the VH region of the MoAb molecule. VH4-34-encoded antibodies that fulfil the above sequence requirements have cold agglutinin activity towards the i antigen of cord erythrocytes. In vivo, such anti-i/anti-B cell antibodies are rarely detected in healthy adults, but serum levels are dramatically elevated in selective pathological conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and infectious mononucleosis. This strict regulation may be related to the novel and rapid mechanism of human B cell toxicity demonstrated by antibodies encoded by a single human VH gene.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic splenectomy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term impairment of humoral and cellular immunity. Alternatives to surgery have been developed to minimize or avoid the immediate and/or long-term complications of splenectomy. Herein we investigated the long-term effect of non-operative management (NOM) of the traumatic rupture of the spleen on the distribution of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte populations and cytokine production by T cells. PB samples were drawn from six NOM patients, 13 age-matched adults who had undergone splenectomy after trauma (SP patients) and 31 age-matched controls. Cellular phenotypes and the intracellular production of interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in T cells were determined in whole blood?±?mitogens by flow cytometry. NOM patients did not show any changes in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the distribution of their subsets, compared to the controls. In contrast, SP patients showed a sustained increase in the percentage and/or absolute numbers of lymphocytes, CD8 T cells, activated CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK)?T cells, NK cells and ?δ T cells, and a reduction in naive CD4 T cells. The constitutive or induced cytokine production by T cells of the NOM group was similar to the control group, whereas SP patients had increased percentages of constitutive IL-2- and IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells and IFN-?-producing CD4 T cells. Our findings indicate collectively that the healing process in NOM does not affect the architecture of the spleen to such an extent that it would lead to long-term alterations of the proportions of PB lymphocytes or the T cell cytokine profiles.

AB  - Summary In cases of arginine depletion, lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and CD3? chain expression are all diminished. In addition to myeloid suppressor cells, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) also exert T-cell immune suppressive effects through arginase-induced l-arginine depletion, especially during pregnancy. In this study, we investigated how arginase/l-arginine modulates neonatal lymphocyte proliferation. Results showed that the neonatal plasma l-arginine level was lower than in adults (48·1 ± 11·3 versus 86·5 ± 14·6 ?m; P = 0·003). Neonatal PMN had a greater abundance of arginase I protein than adult PMN. Both transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation were responsible for the higher arginase I expression of neonatal PMN. Exogenous l-arginine enhanced neonate lymphocyte proliferation but not that of adult cells. The RNA-binding protein HuR was important but was not the only modulation factor in l-arginine-regulated neonatal T-cell proliferation. l-Arginine-mediated neonatal lymphocyte proliferation could not be blocked by interleukin-2 receptor blocking antibodies. These results suggest that the altered arginase/l-arginine cascade may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to altered neonatal immune responses. Exogenous l-arginine could enhance neonate lymphocyte proliferation through an interleukin-2-independent pathway.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Summary Two equids weighing <250?kg were examined several days after suffering severe mid-diaphyseal dorsal metatarsal lacerations. Distal limb vascular disruption was suspected in both cases. Nonselective computed tomography angiography with contrast medium injected peripherally via the jugular veins was used to evaluate the vascular supply to the distal limb. The use of this imaging technique demonstrated either intact or disrupted distal limb vasculature. The imaging results were verified with a positive long-term outcome in the case with a diagnosis of an intact vasculature and with histological findings of avascular necrosis in the case with a diagnosis of disrupted vasculature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplementation of L-arginine as a mechanism to enhance cellular immune response (T lymphocytes), has slowly gained approval, and appears especially important during critical illness. Despite its clinical use, little is known as to the direct effects of L-arginine on the different T lymphocyte subpopulations. Methods: Lymphocytes were harvested from spleens of C57 Bl/6 mice, and proliferation was induced with anti-CD3 in the presence of different concentrations of L-arginine ranging from 0 to 1000 ?mol/L. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effect of L-arginine on T lymphocyte subpopulations. Interleukin-2 production was measured by ELISA and gene expression by RT-PCR. Results: L-Arginine at or greater than 100 ?mol/L significantly enhanced anti-CD3 stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation (p =.01). L-Arginine was essential for adequate T lymphocyte (CD3+) cellular maturation (p =.01). Proliferation of Helper T cells (CD4+) was not dependent on L-arginine. In contrast, Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) showed a dose dependent proliferation in response to L-arginine (p =.01). Of the CD8+ cells, an increase in the CD45RA negative CD8 positive (memory) T cell subpopulation was observed with the addition of L-arginine. In addition, the number of cell surface CD8 receptors (CD8R) and CD3 receptors (CD3R) increased in the presence of L-arginine (p =.01, p =.04). Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was not up-regulated by L-arginine. L-Arginine modestly increased IL-2 production and had pronounced effects on its disappearance from the culture media (p <.0001). Interleukin-2 mRNA expression was not dependent on L-arginine. Conclusions: The requirements for L-arginine for the proliferation of CD3 stimulated T lymphocytes vary widely, and have to be taken into account when studying the mechanism of how L-arginine enhances cellular proliferation. L-Arginine may increase cellular proliferation by increasing specific receptor expression and the utilization of interleukin-2. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 25:23?29, 2001)

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Despite the blood?brain barrier (BBB) the human CNS is continuously screened by blood-derived immunological cells. In certain brain areas the local BBB configuration grants passage of large molecules, whereas others are better shielded. We investigated whether these regional BBB compositions are paralleled by differences in the degree of cellular immunosurveillance by investigating tissue from 23 normal human brains for several CD markers, FoxP3, granzyme B, and perforin. Our results provide evidence that immunosurveillance is associated with locoregional BBB configuration and is mainly performed by CD3+/CD8+/granzyme B-/perforin- lymphocytes.
