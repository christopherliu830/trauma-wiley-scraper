AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in animals with anterior uveitis. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). Procedures Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. Results Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. Conclusions Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Steroid responsive meningitis-arteriitis (SRMA) is an immunemediated disorder commonly recognised in dogs in small animal practice. Two different forms of SRMA may occur. The typical, acute form of SRMA is characterised by cervical rigidity, pain, pyrexia and a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a less common, chronic form of SRMA, additional neurological deficits consistent with a spinal cord or a multi-focal neurological disorder may be present, often accompanied by a mononuclear CSF pleocytosis. The prognosis for young dogs in the acute stage of SRMA is relatively good with early and aggressive anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. In more protracted, relapsing cases of SRMA the prognosis is guarded, and therapy requires more aggressive, long term immunosuppression. The complete etiopathogenesis of SRMA is unknown; however, an aberrant immune response directed against the central nervous system (CNS) is most likely. Neutrophilic pleocytosis in SRMA seems to be facilitated by chemotactic factors in the CSF and upregulation of integrins and metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood brain barrier. Upregulation of IgA, induced by a Th2 immune response, also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of SRMA.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Summary Recently several parameters have been introduced to the complete blood count such as nucleated red blood cells, immature granulocytes; immature reticulocyte fraction, immature platelet fraction and red cell fragments as well as new parameters for detection of functional iron deficiency. Leucocyte positional parameters, which may diagnose specific diseases (e.g. differentiate between abnormal lymphocytes in leukaemia and viral conditions and may also detect malarial infection) are now available. At this time they are only used for research; however, generally such parameters later become reportable. One manufacturer?s routine analyser allows measurement of cells by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. Currently, there are no accredited external quality assessment schemes (EQAS) for these parameters. For a number of parameters, on some instruments, there is no internal quality control, which brings into question whether these parameters should be used for clinical decision making. Other more established parameters, such as mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate do not have EQAS available. The UK National EQAS for General Haematology held a workshop earlier this year in 2008 to discuss these parameters. Participants were asked to provide a consensus opinion on which parameters are the most important for inclusion in future haematology EQAS.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - Summary Background Staphylococcus aureus has important implications for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). In some patients S. aureus can be eradicated from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, while in others bacterial colonization is persistent. Potential mechanisms and features of these two distinct groups of patients are not known. Objective Accordingly, we studied relationships between the ability to eliminate S. aureus during an anti-inflammatory treatment and selected clinical and immunological features. Methods Quantitative assessment of S. aureus on the skin, in nasal vestibule and throat, serum IgE levels, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, lymphocyte proliferation and phagocyte oxidative burst were determined during the exacerbation and after 4 and 12 weeks of the treatment using topical steroid and oral antihistamine in 34 patients with AD. Results S. aureus was found on the skin of all 34 patients during exacerbation. Disease severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) correlated with the density of bacteria. Treatment with oral antihistamine and topical steroid resulted in a significant alleviation of symptoms, which correlated with the elimination of S. aureus from the skin in 70% of patients. In the remaining 30% of patients, dense (more than 1010/cm2) S. aureus skin colonization, persisted despite the treatment. Patients with persistent S. aureus presented with higher serum IgE levels, lower lymphocyte proliferation in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B, phytohaemagluttinin and anti-CD3. Persistence of S. aureus was more common in men. Conclusions Patients with AD differ in the ability to clear S. aureus from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, which appears to be related to the abnormalities in immunological parameters. Local antibiotic therapy should be considered only in patients with persistent S. aureus colonization.

The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Summary Characterization of host immune cell parameters prior to treatment is expected to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical outcome as well as to elucidate why some patients fail to respond to immunotherapy. We monitored blood immune cells from 58 patients with non-small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing surgery of the primary tumor and from 50 age-matched healthy volunteers. Complete leukocyte blood count, the number of circulating dendritic cells (DC), HLA-DRlow monocytes and several lymphocytic subpopulations were determined by eight-color flow cytometry. Furthermore, the prognostic value of the immune cell parameters investigated was evaluated by patients? survival analysis. Compared to the control group, blood of NSCLC patients contained more neutrophils resulting in a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), but a lower number of blood DC, in particular of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), natural killer (NK) cells and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, a higher frequency of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and HLA-DRlow monocytes was detected, and smoking had a significant impact on these values. HLA-DRlow monocytes were positively correlated to the number of neutrophils, monocytes and NLR, but negatively associated with the number of pDC and naive CD4+ T cells. The frequency of Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as the ratios of CD4/HLA-DRlow monocytes and HLA-DRlow monocytes/pDC correlated with patient?s overall survival. Next to Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive T cells represent prognostic markers for NSCLC patients and might be useful for monitoring of patients? responses to immunotherapies in future studies.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Berglundh T, Zitzmann NU, Donati M. Are peri-implantitis lesions different from periodontitis lesions? J Clin Periodontol 2011; 38 (Suppl. 11): 188?122. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01672.x. Abstract Aim: To compare histopathological characteristics of peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions. Methods: A search was conducted on publications up to July 2010. Studies carried out on human biopsy material and animal experiments were considered. Results: While comprehensive information exists regarding histopathological characteristics of human periodontitis lesions, few studies evaluated peri-implantitis lesions in human biopsy material. Experimental peri-implantitis lesions were evaluated in 10 studies and three of the studies included comparisons to experimental periodontitis. Human biopsy material: the apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate (ICT) was more pronounced in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis and was in most cases located apical of the pocket epithelium. Plasma cells and lymphocytes dominated among cells in both types of lesions, whereas neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages occurred in larger proportions in peri-implantitis. Experimental studies: placement of ligatures together with plaque formation resulted in loss of supporting tissues and large ICTs around implants and teeth. Following ligature removal, a ?self-limiting? process occurred in the tissues around teeth with a connective tissue capsule that separated the ICT from bone, while in peri-implant tissues the ICT extended to the bone crest. Conclusion: Despite similarities regarding clinical features and aetiology of peri-implantitis and periodontitis, critical histopathological differences exist between the two lesions.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.
