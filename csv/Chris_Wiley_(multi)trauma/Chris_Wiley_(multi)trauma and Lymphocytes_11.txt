AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To describe a case of a conjunctivo-corneal mass in a cat associated with acid-fast bacilli. Methods? A 2-year-old female black European Short-Hair cat, living outdoors in a suburban environment in Italy, was referred for evaluation of a nodular, vascularized mass of 2 weeks duration. The mass involved the dorsal bulbar conjunctiva at the temporal canthus of OS and invaded the sclera and cornea. Routine ophthalmic and systemic examination, serologic testing, cytology and histology of the mass were performed. Mycobacterium specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of variable regions 1, 2 and 3 of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was also performed. Results? Neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and giant cells with intracytoplasmic acid-fast bacilli were seen on cytological examination. The histological examination confirmed the presence of a granulomatous lesion with acid-fast bacilli within macrophages. Bacteriological culture of the material from the lesion was negative for Mycobacterium spp. Mycobacterium 16S rRNA gene specific PCR was positive. A diagnosis of feline leprosy was made. The owners refused any treatment, and 1 year later the lesion was still present. Conclusions? Veterinary ophthalmologists should be aware of conjunctivo-corneal leproma as an unusual symptom of leprosy.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Summary While T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis for more than three decades, the focus on the T helper type 17 (Th17) subset of CD4 T cells and their secreted cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, is much more recent. Proinflammatory actions of IL-17 were first identified in the 1990s, but the delineation of a distinct Th17 subset in late 2005 has sparked great interest in the role of these cells in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. This review summarizes current understanding of the role of Th17 cells and their products in both animal models of inflammatory arthritis and human immune-driven arthritides.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Abstract Proliferation of astrocytes plays an essential role during ontogeny and in the adult brain, where it occurs following trauma and in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases as well as in normal, healthy mammals. The cellular mechanisms underlying glial proliferation remain poorly understood. As dopamine is known to modulate proliferation in different cell populations, we investigated the effects of dopamine on the proliferation of striatal astrocytes in vitro. We found that dopamine reduced proliferation. As proliferation involves, among other things, a change in cell volume, which normally comes with water movement across the membrane, water channels might represent a molecular target of the dopamine effect. Therefore we studied the effect of dopamine on aquaporin?4 (AQP4) expression, the main aquaporin subtype expressed in glial cells, and observed a down-regulation of the AQP4-M23 isoform. This down-regulation was the cause of the dopamine-induced decrease in proliferation as knockdown of AQP4 using siRNA techniques mimicked the effects of dopamine on proliferation. Furthermore, stimulation of glial proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor was also abolished by knocking down AQP4. In addition, blocking of AQP4 with 10??m tetraethylammonium inhibited osmotically induced cell swelling and stimulation of glial cell proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor. These results demonstrate a clear-cut involvement of AQP4 in the regulation of proliferation and implicate that modulation of AQP4 could be used therapeutically in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in the regulation of reactive astrogliosis by preventing or reducing the glia scar formation, thus improving regeneration following ischemia or other trauma.

AB  - Abstract Coronary angiography (CA) is the gold standard evaluation of coronary artery disease in potential multi-organ donors. This use of iodinated contrast media could lead to contrast-induced acute kidney injury and consequently to delayed graft function (DGF). All patients in France who received a kidney from a 45-70-year-old donor without medical contraindication for cardiac donation and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor were included. Recipients of preemptive kidney transplant or multi-organ transplant, or who died within the first 8 days post-transplantation were excluded. Data were obtained from CRISTAL database. From March 2012 to June 2014, 892 kidneys from 483 donors were transplanted. DGF was reported in 38.9% of the 375 kidney recipients grafted with a kidney from the 217 donors who had CA and in 45.5% of the 440 kidney recipients who received a kidney from the 257 donors without CA. Multivariate analysis showed that CA or repeated injection of iodinated contrast media did not influence the risk of DGF. CA did not increase the risk of primary non-function, the duration of DGF or post-transplantation hospital stay and did not affect the graft function at 1 year. Evaluation of potential multi-organ donors with CA does not affect kidney graft outcomes.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral lesions of autoimmune etiology (OLAIE) in a cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Materials and methods A multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at the oral medicine practices of Carolinas Medical Center (CMC), Baylor College of Dentistry (BCD), and the University of Florida (UF). Each site performed a chart review of patients with well-characterized pSS. Clinical variables such as OLAIE, traumatic lesions, and medical conditions were compiled at each site. The association between clinical variables and the presence of OLAIE was then assessed for significance. Results We evaluated 155 patients diagnosed with pSS. Nineteen patients with pSS (12.3%) had an OLAIE. CMC reported 11 (21.2%) patients with OLAIE, while BCD and UF reported 4 (7.3%) and 4 (8.3%), respectively. Eleven of the 19 (58%) patients with OLAIE had lichen planus, 6 (32%) had aphthous stomatitis, 1 (5%) had chronic ulcerative stomatitis, and 1 (5%) had lesions of systemic connective tissue disease by immunofluorescence. Conclusion The results of our analysis suggest that patients with pSS have a 12% prevalence of OLAIE with a wide range (7.3?21.2%) found between practices. This difference is likely related to the different screening protocols for oral dryness between sites.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis are common inflammatory conditions of the canine central nervous system. Although each disease has unique histopathological features, these canine disorders collectively seem to be aberrant immune responses directed against the central nervous system. A review of the neurological signs and general neurodiagnostic approach to canine meningoencephalitis is followed by an overview of the specific clinical and neuropathological features of granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis. The aetiopathogenesis of each disorder is explored including potential genetic, immunological, and environmental factors along with the current and prospective immunomodulatory therapies for meningoencephalitis.

AB  - Abstract Deoxynivalenol (DON, also known as vomitoxin) is a common mycotoxin found worldwide, especially in contaminated food. DON is toxic to a variety of cells and tissues in humans. Three kinds of conjugated products (DON-3-glucuronide, DON-15-glucuronide and DON-7-glucuronide) can be found as major metabolites in human urine. Females and males show different patterns of exposure levels, and human exposure to DON also shows some geographical differences because of different DON levels in cereal-based foods, food intake habits and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression. Specifically, the C12, 13-deepoxy metabolite was found predominantly in French adults but was rarely detected in UK adults. However, a cohort of Spanish individuals demonstrated even lower DON levels than the levels in the UK populations, whereas a very high DON exposure level was detected in South Africa and Linxian, China. Recent publications have further indicated that DON could be detected in the urine of pregnant women from different countries, which suggests that there is a potential risk to both mothers and foetuses. Additionally, phytochemicals have been shown to be less toxic to cells and laboratory animals in research studies and may also be used as food additives for reducing the toxic effects of DON. In this review, we provide global information on DON metabolism, human exposure and gender differences in humans. Also, control strategies for this mycotoxin are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Vulvodynia in young women is a significant clinical challenge. This overview focuses on localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV) with regard to medical and physical predictors of the condition. Several causative factors have been proposed and one major conceptual issue is the role of inflammation. Trauma to the vestibular mucosa causes an initial inflammatory response which may result in peripheral and central pain sensitization. In women with LPV, evidence of mucosal nerve fiber proliferation and enhanced systemic pain perception has been found. A dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles is common and many patients also suffer from other bodily pain. In general, the level of scientific quality in published studies on vulvodynia is low. Further research on epidemiology, etiology and conduction of clinical trials with high evidence grade is desired.

AB  - Case Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) caused by Clostridium butyricum is common in neonates; however, a case of NEC in adults has not been previously reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man developed C. butyricum-related NEC during hospitalization for treatment of stab wounds to the left side of the neck and lower abdomen, without organ damage, and concomitant pneumonia. Outcome The patient developed acute onset of emesis accompanied by shock during his admission; partial resection of the small intestine was carried out due to necrosis. Pathologic findings showed mucosal necrosis and extensive vacuolation with gram-positive rods in the necrotic small intestine. Blood culture tests revealed C. butyricum infection. The patient's condition improved after the surgery. He was moved to a rehabilitation hospital on day 66. Conclusion This study suggests that hospitalized adult patients who receive antibiotic treatment are at risk for NEC.

AB  - A 9-year, 6-month old spayed female Jack Russell terrier presented with a 3-week history of intermittent vomiting, diarrhoea and weight loss. Serum biochemistry demonstrated severe panhypoproteinaemia, mild hypocalcaemia and mild hypocholesterolaemia, consistent with protein-losing enteropathy. Full-thickness biopsies obtained from the stomach and different sections of small intestine demonstrated histological features of both myenteric ganglionitis and early intestinal leiomyositis. Complete resolution of clinical signs occurred within 1?week of implementing immunosuppressive therapy. At the time of writing, 9?months following diagnosis, the dog remains in remission.

AB  - Non-erosive polyarthritis is one of the most common clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE has not been well documented and is rarely diagnosed in cats. This article describes an unusual presentation of erosive polyarthritis with SLE in three cats restrospectively identified over a 14-year period. Historical, clinical, serological and radiographical and pathological aspects of these cases are discussed.
