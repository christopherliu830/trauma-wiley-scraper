AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.

AB  - Inflammatory cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical step in the response to diverse insults, including infection, trauma and infarction, as well as immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite considerable advances in understanding immune surveillance and antigen recognition in the CNS, the signals resulting in parenchymal inflammation are incompletely understood. Members of a novel family of chemo-attractant cytokines, the chemokines, are made in the CNS and are emerging as likely mediators of inflammatory cell migration into the CNS.

AB  - Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, characterised by recurrent crops of necrotic self-healing papules and nodules. Although chronic, LyP typically has a benign clinical course in the majority of cases. Histologically, a malignant appearing T-cell lymphoid infiltrate is seen. The atypical cells often resemble the cerebriform cells of mycosis fungoides or Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 10?20% of the patients go on to develop lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides, CD30-positive anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin lymphoma. We report a case of LyP associated with a B-cell lymphoma. A 50-year-old male, presented with scattered erythematous scaly papules, some with central crust, located on the arms, trunk and leg of one-month duration. A skin biopsy revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with many large atypical lymphocytes, resembling Reed Sternberg cells. By immunohistochemistry, the large cells were positive for T-cell markers and CD30. Subsequently, he developed fever, night sweats and diffuse lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy showed a vaguely nodular proliferation of small to medium lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic and flow cytometric studies best characterised the process as mantle cell lymphoma. Although, LyP has been previously associated with lymphomas of above-mentioned types, this is an extremely unusual case presenting with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

AB  - Spectral Imaging Microscopy (SIM) is a technique for performing image-enabled spectroscopic analysis using a standard light microscope. We employed a prototype to a current, commercially available, spectral imaging system (NuanceTM, CRI, Inc.) that electro-optically selects narrow bands of light to be collected by a cooled, monochrome CCD camera. For each sample, images were taken every 10?nm from 420?nm to 720?nm to create a spectral image ?stack.? Analysis of the images with a prototype to the Nuance TM Analyze software (CRI, Inc.) gave both standard color (RGB) and spectral information at each pixel of the images. A representative 40x field was spectrally imaged from H&E slides of 104 biopsy specimens of mycosis fungoides (MF). Optical densities and spectral properties of small lymphocytes were determined. Hyperchromatic cells were pseudocolored to show their distribution. In addition to the important architectural features of MF, SIM can define whether hyperchromatic or normochromatic small lymphocytes are epidermotropic in the lesion by setting appropriate threshold values. Hyperchromasia can be attributed to increased nuclear eosinophilia or basophilia. These differences are difficult to estimate by eye. Since lymphoblasts have enlarged nuclei with dispersed chromatin, a combination of spectral and spatial data is required for their analysis.

AB  - A 65 year-old, well-appearing and asymptomatic man presented with a small non-healing ulcer on the right palm present for 6 weeks. He reported a 15 year history of hand and foot ?eczema? treated with topical steroids. Six months earlier his right 4th toe had been amputated for ?infection?, but additional information was not immediately forthcoming. Punch biopsy from the palm demonstrated superficial ulceration, dermal eosinophils and possible cytoplasmic inclusions within keratinocytes, leading to suspicion of parapox infection. Over the ensuing two months his condition deteriorated markedly, and he developed multiple fungated and ulcerated cutaneous nodules. Incisional biopsy of the nodule on the right palm revealed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, and a perivascular infiltrate of medium to large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei and mitoses. These atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, but were negative for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, TIA-1 and EBER in-situ hybridization. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement revealed a clonal population. Retrospective analysis of the amputated toe demonstrated similar features. He declined conventional treatment, and has been reluctant to pursue follow-up. Our case highlights the fulminant course and dense mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with eosinophils often present in peripheral T-cell lymphoma that may complicate diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a chemokine for T-lymphocytes and as a marker of magnitude of contact allergy. Subjects, Materials and Methods:? Urushiol, the contact allergen of poison ivy, was applied to allergic and anergic volunteers. Suction blisters of urushiol exposed and non-exposed skin were produced 48?h later and the fluids were analyzed for chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes using modified Boyden chambers. Anti-IL-8-antibodies were added to the fluids to investigate their effect on the chemotactic activity. IL-8 protein concentration of the fluids was determined by ELISA and its correlation with visible test responses was investigated. Results:? Significant chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes was only present in blister fluid from urushiol exposed skin and only from the allergic subjects. The chemotactic activity could be neutralized with the anti-IL-8 antibodies. There was an excellent correlation between the IL-8 protein concentration in blister fluids and the clinical appearance of the inflammatory reactions at the skin test sites. Conclusions:? The results support the hypothesis that IL-8 in blister fluid is both chemotactic for T-lymphocytes and is a sensitive marker of an inflammatory response. Determination of the concentration of IL-8 proteins in blister fluid of patch tests may be of future use for objective assessment of clinically important contact allergies.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are a group of molecules with an extremely broad range of activities on a variety of target cells. This review summarizes the known cytokine and cytokine receptor expression in primary brain tumors and derived cell lines. These expression patterns are compared with those occurring in other CNS diseases, such as virus or bacterial infections, experimental allergic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and trauma. A variety of cytokines are expressed during CNS neoplasia; their potential involvement in tumor growth through a variety of mechanisms, such as autocrine or paracrine growth stimulation, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion, are discussed. Finally, results of preliminary therapeutic approaches with cytokines are critically evaluated. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Macaque species, specifically rhesus (Macaca mulatta), are the most common nonhuman primates (NHPs) used in biomedical research due to their suitability as a model of high priority diseases (e.g., HIV, obesity, cognitive aging), cost effective breeding and housing compared to most other NHPs, and close evolutionary relationship to humans. With this close evolutionary relationship, however, is a shared adaptation for a socially stimulating environment, without which both their welfare and suitability as a research model are compromised. While outdoor social group housing provides the best approximation of a social environment that matches the macaque behavioral biology in the wild, this is not always possible at all facilities, where animals may be housed indoors in small groups, in pairs, or alone. Further, animals may experience many housing changes in their lifetime depending on project needs, changes in social status, management needs, or health concerns. Here, we review the evidence for the physiological and health effects of social housing changes and the potential impacts on research outcomes for studies using macaques, particularly rhesus. We situate our review in the context of increasing regulatory pressure for research facilities to both house NHPs socially and mitigate trauma from social aggression. To meet these regulatory requirements and further refine the macaque model for research, significant advances must be made in our understanding and management of rhesus macaque social housing, particularly pair-housing since it is the most common social housing configuration for macaques while on research projects. Because most NHPs are adapted for sociality, a social context is likely important for improving repeatability, reproducibility, and external validity of primate biomedical research. Am. J.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Environmental factors are poorly understood in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The importance of environmental factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants. Results and Discussion We propose the ?AD exposome? to comprehensively assess the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.

AB  - Abstract The 1555 A to G substitution in mitochondrial 12S A-site rRNA is associated with maternally transmitted deafness of variable penetrance in the absence of otherwise overt disease. Here, we recapitulate the suggested A1555G-mediated pathomechanism in an experimental model of mitoribosomal mistranslation by directed mutagenesis of mitoribosomal protein MRPS5. We first establish that the ratio of cysteine/methionine incorporation and read-through of mtDNA-encoded MT-CO1 protein constitute reliable measures of mitoribosomal misreading. Next, we demonstrate that human HEK293 cells expressing mutant V336Y MRPS5 show increased mitoribosomal mistranslation. As for immortalized lymphocytes of individuals with the pathogenic A1555G mutation, we find little changes in the transcriptome of mutant V336Y MRPS5 HEK cells, except for a coordinated upregulation of transcripts for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. Homozygous knock-in mutant Mrps5 V338Y mice show impaired mitochondrial function and a phenotype composed of enhanced susceptibility to noise-induced hearing damage and anxiety-related behavioral alterations. The experimental data in V338Y mutant mice point to a key role of mitochondrial translation and function in stress-related behavioral and physiological adaptations.

AB  - Summary This report describes a case of a multiple-drug resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii associated with bronchopneumonia in a horse. A 6-month-old Thoroughbred colt was examined for a chronic lower respiratory tract disease. Prior to presentation to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UVTH), the colt had been treated intensively in a private equine hospital for presumed antimicrobial-induced enterocolitis following treatment with azithromycin and rifampin, and had been discharged on treatment of doxycycline for continued lower airway abnormalities. At the UVTH, investigation of the lower airway disease included a culture of a percutaneous transtracheal wash, which identified a multiple-drug resistant strain of A. baumannii as the causative agent with sensitivity only to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim sulphonamides. Following treatment with marbofloxacin there was full resolution of the bronchopneumonia. A. baumannii is a major nosocomial pathogen associated with infections in both animals and man and reports of multiple-drug resistant strains have been documented worldwide. Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections have been reported to occur in very ill human patients housed in healthcare settings such as intensive care units, and are characterised by the rapid development of resistance to the majority of antimicrobials. The difficulties in the treatment of such cases as well as the potential risk of transmission within a veterinary clinical setting are discussed.

AB  - Background Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (EAF) is a benign rare lesion of the upper respiratory mucosa. EAF most commonly presents with an obstructive nasal mass. Due to the rarity of EAF, case reports and case studies have predominated the literature. This systematic review discusses the demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, management, and outcomes of this uncommon entity. Methods The PubMed database was searched for all articles describing patients diagnosed with sinonasal EAF. Additional cases were examined from the bibliographies of selected articles. Demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, radiography, management, and outcome were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases were included from 34 articles, including 1 case from our institution. The most common presenting symptom was nasal obstruction (78.8%). Fourteen patients (26.9%) had a previous history of nasal surgery or trauma. Surgical resection alone was the most commonly used primary treatment approach (50.0%), resulting in the greatest proportion of disease-free patients (55.6%) over a median follow-up period of 36 months. A combination of surgery and corticosteroids was the second-most-common treatment modality, used in 28.8% of cases. Of the 40 cases reporting patient outcomes, 100% of patients were alive at follow-up independent of treatment modality. Conclusion To date, this review contains the largest number of patients with sinonasal EAF. Aggressive surgical resection alone constitutes the most common treatment modality and may be most effective at eradicating disease.
