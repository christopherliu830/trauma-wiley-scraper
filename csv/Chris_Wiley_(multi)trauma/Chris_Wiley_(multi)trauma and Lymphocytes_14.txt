AB  - Background Free tissue transfers performed in patients with hematological diseases represent significant challenges for micro-surgeons. There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. Methods A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. Results Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). Conclusions Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) culls pathogenic T lymphocytes, be these the clones of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or mediators of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT-GVHD). Whether or not ECP may have an effect in the rarer instances of solid organ transplantation?associated GVHD (SOT-GVHD) is unclear. Mortality rates in SOT-GVHD rival those of transfusion-associated GVHD, with fatalities preceded by pancytopenia and peripheral blood chimerism (PBC) levels exceeding 20%. ECP has been described in two SOT-GVHD cases to date, with one surviving. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Clinicolaboratory features (including HLA relationships) in a case of multivisceral transplantation were reviewed from the time of surgery to the onset and progression of SOT-GVHD. ECP, which was introduced as a less immunosuppressive and more selective intervention, was assessed for its effect on serial PBC (as measured by short-tandem-repeat analysis) and clinical outcome. RESULTS Multivisceral SOT-GVHD manifested with erythroderma, neutropenic sepsis, and PBC increasing from 6% on Posttransplant Day (PTD) 38 to 78% by PTD 60 (at a doubling time of 6 days despite corticosteroids). ECP was administered on PTDs 62 and 67 and was associated with the first evidence of PBC decay to 67% on PTD 69. Death nevertheless ensued on the last day of salvage antithymocyte globulin (PTDs 69-73) despite further PBC reduction to 41%. CONCLUSION Further study is needed to determine if the sooner or more frequent application of ECP might attenuate the high case fatality rates of SOT-GVHD.

AB  - Summary Isolated angiokeratomas are common benign cutaneous lesions, generally deemed unworthy of further investigation. In contrast, diffuse angiokeratomas should alert the physician to a possible diagnosis of Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by α-galactosidase deficiency. Glycosphingolipids accumulate in cells throughout the body resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Difficulties are encountered when trying to interpret the significance of angiokeratomas because they may also occur in other lysosomal storage disorders and rarely in an isolated manner in Fabry disease. We present an algorithm for the classification of angiokeratomas which might prove useful for the diagnosis and management of Fabry disease. Assessment of the clinical features and location of the lesions, personal and family history, skin biopsy, dermoscopy and electron microscopy imaging are sequential steps in the diagnostic process. Assessing the deficiency of α-galactosidase enzyme activity is essential to confirm the diagnosis in males, while mutation analysis is always needed in females. Potentially this algorithm can change the current approach to patients when Fabry disease is suspected, thus improving the diagnostic strategy and management of this disorder. It remains to be decided whether the use of an algorithm might reduce the number of genetic consultations. As evidence has shown the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in halting progression of the disease before the onset of irreversible organ damage, it is advisable to aim at an early diagnosis in order to achieve timely initiation of effective treatment with benefits for patients and appropriate use of medical resources.

AB  - A hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics scheme is described to explore the structural basis and energetic behavior of short peptide segments binding to HLA-A*0201. This method was used to analyze 50 structurally diverse non-americ peptides and results showed that the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics-derived interaction energy, in conjugation with empirical desolvation free energy, linearly correlate well with the experimentally determined affinity. Further systematic investigations of several HLA-A*0201?peptide complexes confirmed the importance of anchor residues and water molecules in peptide binding, and quantitatively showed that: (i) the primary and second anchor residues provide a larger binding energy contribution (>3?kcal/mol) than the non-anchor residues (<2?kcal/mol), (ii) native hydrophobic anchor residues replaced by polar amino acids will lead to a significant destabilization for bound complexes (>4?kcal/mol), and (iii) water molecules contribute significantly to stabilization of the complexes (>8?kcal/mol). We believe that this work is helpful for elucidating the roles of anchor residues and water molecules in peptides recognized and bound by HLA-A*0201.

AB  - A novel murine experimental wound infection model was used to assess the efficacy of multi-component immunization against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Necrotic lesions were induced in mice with venom from Bothrops asper and infected with a low inoculum, 1 ? 102 CFU. The wound infection model therefore more resembles a clinical case of S. aureus infection compared with conventional infection models where far more bacteria are required. Before infection, mice were immunized with four recombinant S.aureus proteins expressed from Escherichia coli: (i) domains 1?3 of Extracellular adherence protein (Eap), (ii) Efb ? D (fusion protein combining Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) and a fibronectin binding domain (D) of the fibronectin binding protein (FnBP) and (iii) clumping factor A (ClfA). In the immunized group, lower bacterial colonization, undisturbed crust formation and significantly faster wound healing were found compared with the unimmunized control group. Efb and Eap have previously been found to impair wound healing and neutralization of these proteins by antibodies restores a more natural wound healing process. This effect is further also enhanced by the proposed opsonic activity of antibodies against ClfA and FnBP.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of chronic cough caused by non-acid reflux. Methods:? Seven patients with chronic cough due to non-acid reflux, 12 patients with chronic cough due to acid reflux, 10 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without cough and 12 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. All subjects underwent oesophageal multi-channel intraluminal impedance measurements combined with pH monitoring, and assessment of cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin and induced sputum cytology. The concentrations of substance P, mast cell tryptase, prostaglandin D2 and histamine in induced sputum were measured by ELISA. Results:? Cough threshold C2 and C5 did not differ between patients with chronic cough due to non-acid or acid reflux, but the values were significantly lower than those for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without cough and healthy volunteers. Weakly acidic reflux episodes were obviously more frequent in patients with chronic cough due to non-acid reflux than in the other three groups. Sputum substance P and mast cell tryptase concentrations were remarkably increased in patients with chronic cough, but were similar for those with cough due to non-acid or acid reflux. There were significant inverse correlations between substance P levels and cough threshold C2 or C5 in patients with cough due to non-acid or acid reflux, and between mast cell tryptase levels and cough threshold C2 in patients with cough due to acid reflux. Conclusions:? Chronic cough due to non-acid reflux may be related to cough reflex hypersensitivity caused by neurogenic airway inflammation and mast cell activation, in which weakly acidic reflux is possibly a major factor.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Atherosclerotic vascular disease not only remains the leading cause of death in the Western countries, but it has become the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the low- and middle-income countries as well. Therefore, better understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and its prevention are of fundamental importance. It is well known that it affects sequentially the aorta followed by coronary, carotid, peripheral, and intracerebral arteries, with some individual variability. The mechanisms of progression are similar in each of the beds, with increasing lipid accumulation in the arterial wall along with macrophages and T-cell infiltration, paucity of smooth-muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition, and endothelial-cell dysfunction and hypercoagulability playing an important role at the time of acute manifestations of the disease. Fundamental to this inflammatory process is the presence of classic risk factors, regardless of the involved territory. Therefore, the concept of palliative treatment must be reserved for only those who have progressed beyond preventive measures. Mt Sinai J Med 79:641?653, 2012. ? 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Summary We report a case of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent host. Several nodules, isolated or sometimes joint to form plaques, affected the right arm. The arm was paralytic and hypoplastic, and a history of numerous abrasions picking firewood up preceded the onset of the eruption. Histology on skin biopsy documented a dermal infiltrate constituted of histiocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and rare giant cells. Numerous rounded periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) bodies were also present. Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans grew upon culture. Complete blood, biochemical and instrumental examinations resulted in findings within normal range. Treatment with itraconazole 200?mg daily for 4?months led to complete recovery. During a 2-year follow-up, the patient did not present any relapse or dissemination to other organs.

AB  - Conventional classification schemes for canine lymphomas do not discriminate between phenotypically indistinct tumours that may exhibit differences in behaviour. Transcriptional profiling has the potential to afford objective clinically relevant stratification of canine lymphomas, and its sensitivity means that prognostic assays could be performed on tumour needle aspirates collected without anaesthesia. In this pilot study, we compared the expression profiles derived from surgical biopsies and fine needle aspirates of five lymphomas. The aspirates yielded expression profiles of equivalent complexity and strong similarity (median correlation Coefficient = 0.911) to those generated from corresponding surgical biopsies. Differences in gene expression observed between the two tissue sources suggest that the aspirates represent a purer source of lymphocytes. Despite the absence of a standardized sample collection protocol, the aspirates yielded expression profiles of consistently high quality suggesting that they represent a robust source of tumour tissue for a potential transcriptional profile-based prognostic assay for canine lymphomas

Deregulation of apoptosis occurs to a greater or lesser extent in malignant tumours and in certain skin diseases, and also largely accounts for the progressive depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes in HIV infection. Greater understanding of apoptosis modulation by oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes such as c-myc. Fas, p53, bcl-2, and abl will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Abstract? Despite the best efforts of influenza scientists, companies and health officials to prepare for the next pandemic, most of the world?s people will not have access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. They will have to rely on 19th century public health ?technologies? to see them through. In the 21st century, science ought to be able to provide something better. Influenza scientists study the molecular characteristics of influenza viruses and their signaling effects in cell culture and animal models of infection. While these studies have been enormously informative, they have been unable to explain the system-wide effects of influenza on the host, the increased mortality of younger adults in the 1918 influenza pandemic and the much lower mortality rates in children who were more commonly infected with the 1918 virus. Experiments by non-influenza scientists have defined common cell signaling pathways for acute lung injury caused by different agents, including inactivated H5N1 influenza virus. These pathways include several molecular targets that are up-regulated in acute lung injury and down-regulated by anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, including statins, fibrates, and glitazones. These agents also help reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies multi-organ failure, something often seen in fatal Influenza. Observational studies suggest that statins are beneficial in treating patients with pneumonia (there are no such studies for fibrates and glitazones). Other studies suggest that these agents might be able to ?roll back? the self-damaging host response of young adults to the less damaging response of children and thus save lives. Research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other agents that modify the host response might be useful in managing H5N1 influenza and the next pandemic.
