AB  - Summary Supragingival and subgingival plaque appear to be the multifactorial initiating sources of oropharyngeal inflammation in cats. Inflammation may occur secondary to internal triggers and stimulation from antigens and pathogens located within or below the gingiva and oral mucosa. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of periodontal disease where the inflammation is confined to the gingival soft tissues and does not clinically extend into the tooth's support. Periodontal diseases are the most common oral maladies diagnosed in dogs and cats. Furcation involvement or exposure occurs secondary to periodontitis. Oronasal fistula are established communications between the oral and nasal cavities secondary to advanced periodontal disease extending from the palatal surfaces of the maxillary canine in dogs and from traumatic extraction of the maxillary canine teeth. Professional oral care includes mechanical procedures performed in the oral cavity.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Abstract In electrocutions, death may be caused by alterations in the heart conduction system provoking ventricular fibrillation. This study aims to identify histological cardiac markers of high- and low-voltage electrocution. Two groups of decedents were evaluated: group A included 14 fatalities caused by high- or low-voltage electrocution and group B (control) included 14 fatalities due to other traumatic or disease causes. Myocardial sampling with microscopic examination was performed on all the hearts using the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains to investigate morphological characteristics that could indicate the damage caused by high- and low-voltage electrocutions. Interstitial myocardial hemorrhagic infiltration was the only differentiating finding, which was shown only in high-voltage electrocution. This pathological finding has not been previously reported, and it may be specific to high-voltage electrocution deaths. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Tissue approximation and repair are conventionally performed with sutures and staples, but these means are inherently traumatic. Tissue approximation using laser-responsive nanomaterials can lead to rapid tissue sealing and repair, and is an attractive alternative to existing clinical methods. Here, the use of laser-activated nanosealants (LANS) with gold nanorods (GNRs) embedded in silk fibroin polypeptide matrices is demonstrated. The adaptability of LANS for sealing soft tissues is demonstrated using two different modalities: insoluble thin films for internal, intestinal tissue repair, and semisoluble pastes for external repair, shown by skin repair in live mice. Laser repaired intestinal tissue held over seven times more fluid pressure than sutured intestine and also prevented bacterial leakage. Skin incisions in mice closed using LANS' showed indication of increased mechanical strength and faster repair compared to suturing. Laser-activated silk-GNR nanosealants rapidly seal soft-tissue tears and show high promise for tissue approximation and repair in trauma and routine surgery.

AB  - Abstract Wildlife pathogens can alter host fitness. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection is thought to have negligible impacts on wild birds; however, effects of infection in free-living birds are largely unstudied. We investigated the extent to which LPAIV infection and shedding were associated with body condition and immune status in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a partially migratory key LPAIV host species. We sampled mallards throughout the species' annual autumn LPAIV infection peak, and we classified individuals according to age, sex, and migratory strategy (based on stable hydrogen isotope analysis) when analyzing data on body mass and five indices of immune status. Body mass was similar for LPAIV-infected and noninfected birds. The degree of virus shedding from the cloaca and oropharynx was not associated with body mass. LPAIV infection and shedding were not associated with natural antibody (NAbs) and complement titers (first lines of defense against infections), concentrations of the acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp), ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes (H:L ratio), and avian influenza virus (AIV)-specific antibody concentrations. NAbs titers were higher in LPAIV-infected males and local (i.e., short distance) migrants than in infected females and distant (i.e., long distance) migrants. Hp concentrations were higher in LPAIV-infected juveniles and females compared to infected adults and males. NAbs, complement, and Hp levels were lower in LPAIV-infected mallards in early autumn. Our study demonstrates weak associations between infection with and shedding of LPAIV and the body condition and immune status of free-living mallards. These results may support the role of mallards as asymptomatic carriers of LPAIV and raise questions about possible coevolution between virus and host.

The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - ABSTRACT This report presents six cases of canine transmissible venereal tumour (TVT) in the genital organs with metastasis to extragenital locations. These extragenital sites were the skin, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, liver and lung. Foci of metastasis were found in six different organs in one case, two organs in another case and one organ in the remaining four cases. Multiple tumour nodules were, however, found in certain organs such as the skin and spleen. The extragenital tumours were identified as TVT on the basis of their histological similarity to the primary genital tumours. Metastasis appeared to be mainly by lymphatic pathways and by oral implantation. Résumé. Ce rapport présente six cas de tumeur vénérienne transmissible (TVT) dans les organes génitaux avec métastase aux endroits extragénitaux. Ces endroits extragénitaux étaient la peau, les nouds lymphatiques, la rate, les amygdales, le foie et les poumons. Des foyers de métastase ont été trouvés dans six organes différents dans un cas, dans deux organes dans un autre cas et dans un organe dans les quatre cas restant. On a, cependant, trouvé des tumeurs multi-nodulaires dans certains organes tels que la peau et la rate. Les tumeurs extragénitales ont été identifiées comme TVT en se basant sur leur similarité histologique aux tumeurs génitales primaires. La métastase semblait ?tre principalement par voies lymphatiques et par implantation orale. Zusammenfassung. Dieser Bericht stellt sechs Fa?lle dar von ùbertragbar venerischem Hunde-Tumor (TVT) in den Geschlechtsorganen mit Métastase an extragenitalen Stellen. Dièse extragenitalen Stellen waren die Haut, Lymphknoten, Milz, Mandeln, Leber und Lunge. Herden von Metastasen fand man in sechs verschiedenen Organen in einem Fall, zwei Organen in einem anderen Fall und in einem Organ in den ùbrigen vier Fa?llen. Zahlreiche Tumorkno?tchen (Noduli) wurden jedoch in gewissen Organen wie Haut und Milz gefunden. Die extragenitalen Tumoren waren als TVT identifiziert auf Grund ihrer histologischen a?hnlichkeit mit den primaren Geschlechtstumoren. Metastasen traten hauptsàchlich durch lymphatische Bahnen und durch orale Einpflanzung ein.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 92?101. Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of depressed metabolism and reduced body temperature called ?torpor? that are interspersed by normothermic arousal periods. Numerous cellular processes are halted during torpor, including transcription, translation, and ion homeostasis. Hibernators are able to survive long periods of low blood flow and body temperature followed by rewarming and reperfusion without overt signs of organ injury, which makes these animals excellent models for application of natural protective mechanisms to human medicine. This review examines efforts to induce torpor-like states in non-hibernating species using pharmacological compounds. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of natural and pharmacologically induced torpor will speed the development of new clinical approaches to treat a variety of trauma and stress states in humans.

AB  - Abstract An unusual case of breast carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) was reported, for which the diagnosis was made by aspiration biopsy. The OGCs appeared to derive from large mononuclear cells, probably via their cellular fusion. The mononuclear cells had abundant lysosome-like granules, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. They were thought to be histiocytic cells, though active phagocytosis could not be demonstrated. Histologically, the tumor showed a pattern of well differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, of which the stroma was crowded with histiocytic cells, OGCs, and lymphocytes. Marked hemorrhage and fibrosis were also seen. The tumor cells tended to be distorted and greatly diminished in accord with the accumulation of OGCs. Cancer 52:74-78, 1983.

AB  - Abstract A 5·5-year-old male castrated Bernese mountain dog presented with respiratory difficulties and was diagnosed with haemorrhagic pericardial effusion which transformed into chylopericardium. Thoracic duct ligation and subtotal pericardiectomy in combination with biopsy of an enlarged tracheobronchial lymph node were performed. Multiple clusters of mesothelial cell emboli were observed in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. No causative agent for the pericardial effusion could be identified, suggesting that this is a case of mesothelial cell embolisation associated with idiopathic -chylopericardium in a dog.
