AB  - Abstract Radiation-induced skin reactions are an unavoidable side effect of external beam radiation therapy, particularly in areas prone to friction and excess moisture such as the axilla, head and neck region, perineum and skin folds. Clinical studies investigating interventions for preventing or managing these reactions have largely focussed on formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties. However, none of these interventions has emerged as a consistent candidate for best practice. Much less emphasis has been placed on evaluating ways to protect the radiation-damaged skin from friction and excess moisture. This mini review analyses the clinical evidence for barrier products that form a protective layer by adhering very closely to the skin folds and do not cause further trauma to the radiation-damaged skin upon removal. A database search identified only two types of barrier products that fitted these criteria and these were tested in two case series and six controlled clinical trials. Friction protection was most effective when the interventions were used from the start of treatment and continued for several weeks after completion of treatment. Soft silicone dressings (Mepilex Lite and Mepitel Film) and Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film, but not Cavilon Moisturizing Barrier Cream, decreased skin reaction severity, most likely due to differences in formulation and skin build-up properties. It seems that prophylactic use of friction protection of areas at risk could be a worthwhile addition to routine care of radiation-damaged skin.

AB  - This is the author's fifth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more delimited articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited are primarily concerned with medical ailments of the elderly; legal, ethical, and sociological topics receive more limited coverage. The references are divided into categories. The first set (I) deals with some possible causes of aging; the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging; the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients; the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society; and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion of Immunological Origin (RSAI) is currently diagnosed by the occurrence of 2?3 consecutive miscarriages of unknown origin. The psychological trauma incurred by these events is a serious ailment which may be potentially avoided if a method of analysis is derived which may forecast these events and in turn prevent them from occurring. This review intends to examine studies of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) which use laboratory diagnosis and also studies of RSA that do not use laboratory diagnosis. We believe that when laboratory results are incorporated into the diagnosis of RSA/RSAI that treatment is highly successful whereas the absence of laboratory results severely hinders the effectiveness of treatment. It is worth noting that correlating treatment versus outcome is imprudent because of the multiple variables involved in patient cases. It is not imprudent, however, to say that incorporation of laboratory data is essential when diagnosing RSA/RSAI.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Introduction:? The interactions occurring between nervous and immune systems are well documented. These interactions involve several types of chemical messengers including hormones, cytokines, classic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It has been observed that the lymphoid organs receive a dense peptidergic innervation and immune cells produce neuropeptides. Neuropeptides, in turn, are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory processes and in the maturation of the lymphoid organs. Several studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory neuropeptides and their receptors are expressed in the thymus and bursa of fabricius. PACAP is a glucagon/VIP/secretin family peptide. It was originally isolated from the ovine hypothalamus and then it was found in the autonomic nervous system. PACAP is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary function, neurotransmission and neuromodulation. In the immune system, PACAP is expressed in lymphoid tissues of the rat and in the lymphocytes of the duck GALT. PACAP, therefore, could be a messenger of the dialogue between nervous and immune system. It may have a role in the regulation of the inflammatory processes by stimulating histamine and serotonin and modulating the production of the cytokines in immune cells. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of thymus and bursa of fabricius of the duck of different ages by using an antibody anti-PACAP38. Results and Discussion:? In the thymus, PACAP-immunoreactivity was found in lymphoid cells and, with a lesser extent, in epithelial reticular cells. The immunoreactive lymphocytes were primarily observed in the interlobular septa in close vicinity to the interlobular veins. The number of positive lymphocytes increased with ageing. In the bursa of fabricius, PACAP-IR was found in nerve fibres and in a few lymphoid cells. These results suggest that PACAP could play a role in the maturation and involution of these organs and in the immune functions.

AB  - Abstract To investigate ageing-associated changes in cellular immunity, we recruited three groups of healthy subjects based on SENIEUR protocol criteria. In addition, 10 subjects were randomly selected from each group to isolate their T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells; T cell proliferation after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. There were no marked differences in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood T cells, NK cells or B cells among the three groups (P?>?0.05). Also, no significant differences were noted in the numbers of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, or the CD4+/CD8+ ratios (P?>?0.05). After PHA stimulation, T cell proliferation was markedly increased, with the highest level in group C and the lowest level in group A (P?<?0.05). Cytokine-induced killer tumouricidal activities were also dramatically increased, with the highest activity in group C and the lowest activity in group A (P?<?0.05). Our findings suggest that the number of immune cells remains unchanged with advanced age. However, there is a trend for decreased cellular immunity with an increase in age.

AB  - This review summarises the current understanding of immune response and T cell subsets in the context of development of autoimmunity in the dog. Mode of action and rational usage in immune-mediated disease in the dog are discussed for the following drugs: glucocorticoids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, human intravenous immunoglobulin, vincristine, danazol, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil and liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence for drug efficacy is scrutinised for five important immune-mediated diseases: immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, myasthenia gravis, glomerulonephritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Future strategies for more refined manipulation of adverse immune responses are presented.

AB  - Abstract It is still widely believed that while oocytes in invertebrates and lower vertebrates are periodically renewed throughout life, oocytes in humans and higher vertebrates are formed only during the fetal/perinatal period. However, this dogma is questioned, and clashes with Darwinian evolutionary theory. Studies of oogenesis and follicular renewal from ovarian stem cells (OSCs) in adult human ovaries, and of the role of third-party bone marrow-derived cells (monocyte-derived tissue macrophages and T lymphocytes) could help provide a better understanding of the causes of ovarian infertility, its prevention, and potential treatment. We have reported differentiation of distinct cell types from OSC and the production of new eggs in cultures derived from premenopausal and postmenopausal human ovaries. OSCs are also capable of producing neural/neuronal cells in vitro after sequential stimulation with sex steroid combinations. Hence, OSC represent a unique type of totipotent adult stem cells, which could be utilized for autologous treatment of premature ovarian failure and also for autologous stem cell therapy of neurodegenerative diseases without use of allogeneic embryonic stem cells or somatic cell nuclear transfer. The in vivo application of sex steroid combinations may augment the proliferation of existing neural stem cells and their differentiation into mature neuronal cells (systemic regenerative therapy). Such treatment may also stimulate the transdifferentiation of autologous neural stem cell precursors into neural stem cells useful for topical or systemic regenerative treatment.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A 67-year-old Chinese man presented with a longstanding history of asymptomatic, brown-red macules that diffusely involved his trunk and the extremities and was associated with generalized lymphadenopathy. His serum protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. No monoclonal Bence Jones protein was detected in the urine. Flow cytometry of his peripheral blood revealed a normal polyclonal population of B and T cells. Histopathologic examination demonstrated a dense nodular infiltrate of lymphocytes and numerous mature plasma cells in the reticular dermis. Immunoperoxidase studies for kappa and lambda light chains failed to demonstrate clonality. In addition, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies failed to reveal a monoclonal band. A bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormality. Cutaneous and systemic plasmacytosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous infiltrates in which plasma cells predominate.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital for change in mental status. She had a splenectomy five years prior to admission. The white blood cell count was 154,000 cells/microliter with 95% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis and Candida krusei. She developed a wrist lesion at the site of a previous arterial line. The lesion had a striking resemblance to a bulls-eye, with three distinct concentric zones. A bedside touch preparation rapidly processed with Periodic Acid Schiff staining demonstrated a single intact aseptate broad hypha. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae throughout the dermis and subcutis invading both blood vessels and interstitum. A skin biopsy specimen sent for fungal culture grew Rhizopus arrhizus. Cutaneous zygomycosis is a rare, devastating disease that can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. This case illustrates a distinct morphology, which we have coined the ?bulls-eye infarct of cutaneous zygomycosis?. Recognition of this unique appearance allows a rapid bedside diagnosis of this life threatening infection. To our knowledge, this morphology has been reported only twice in the medical literature.

AB  - A 77-year-old white male presented to an outpatient clinic with painful, purpuric macules and papules on his right foot. The patient had recently undergone cardiac catheterization via his right femoral artery. The patient had no other complaints, was afebrile, and generally felt well. The clinical impression was either cholesterol emboli versus vasculitis. A 4?mm punch biopsy was obtained. Histopathology showed a vasculitis with many basophilic organisms consistent with bacteria present within the vascular spaces. There was a perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and neutrophils. A gram stain revealed gram-positive cocci. The clinician was immediately notified and blood cultures were drawn and echocardiogram performed. The cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. While no evidence of endocarditis was found, a psuedoaneurysm of the right femoral artery was noted. Despite rapid admission and treatment, the patient subsequently expired.
