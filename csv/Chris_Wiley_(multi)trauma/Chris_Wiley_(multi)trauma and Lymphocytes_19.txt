AB  - Vocal cord granulomas are rarely observed in brachycephalic breeds but often reported in humans as contact granulomas. Six French bulldogs were included in this retrospective descriptive study. Endoscopic laryngeal examinations were performed on all dogs under general anaesthesia. Vocal cord lesions were exclusively unilateral, exophytic, approximately 3-mm wide ulcerated mucosal nodules, arising from the vocal cord. Histopathological examination mainly revealed chronic inflammatory changes on the laryngeal epithelium which were consistent with laryngeal granulomas described in humans, except for the location: vocal cord in dogs versus vocal process in humans. In humans, granulomas result from chronic physical or chemical insult to laryngeal mucosa (chronic cough or throat clearing, vocal abuse, gastro-esophageal reflux). In brachycephalic breeds, chronic inspiratory efforts and air turbulences and gastro-esophageal reflux are suspected to result in chronic laryngeal inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - Problem? The endocervix is a major target of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, but little is known about the immune repertoire in this tissue, or its response to these common bacteria. Method of study? Using a cytobrush, we isolated cells from the endocervix of 20 women during C. trachomatis infection, and post-antibiotic treatment. Endocervical swabs and blood were taken in parallel. Endocervical cells were enumerated, and endocervical and blood T cells immunophenotyped. Chlamydia trachomatis was genotyped by sequence analysis of the OmpA gene, and quantified by culture. Results? Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes were D, E, F and Ia, and infectious burden varied considerably. Endocervical T cell and neutrophil numbers were highly elevated during infection, with both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets accumulating. Regardless of the presence or absence of infection, the endocervical cell infiltrate was dominated by effector memory T cells, and the numbers of CCR5 and CD103 expressing T cells was significantly higher than in the blood. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) expression by endocervical T cells was significantly increased during infection. Conclusion? The human endocervix exhibits a distinct cellular response to C. trachomatis infection that can be longitudinally evaluated by cytobrush sampling. Infecting organisms can be sampled and analyzed in parallel.

AB  - Summary Over the years, the role of biochemical, immunological, genetic, and other biological aspects in the pathogenesis of vitiligo has been studied. So far, no convincing model describing the interplay of these contributing factors has been formulated. Based on existing research, we propose that vitiligo has a multi-factorial etiology, characterized by multiple steps, but always involving an increase of external or internal phenol/catechol concentration, serving as a preferred surrogate substrate of tyrosinase, competing with its physiological substrate tyrosine. The conversion of these substrates into reactive quinones is reinforced by a disturbed redox balance (increasing hydrogen peroxide). Such reactive quinones can be covalently bound to the catalytic centre of tyrosinase (haptenation). This could give rise to a new antigen, carried by Langerhans cells to the regional lymph node, stimulating the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. However, the activation of such cytotoxic cells is only a first step in skin melanocyte killing, which also depends on a shift in the balance between immune defence and tolerance, e.g. resulting from a decrease in properly functioning T-regulatory cells. With this new model, based on a synthesis of several of the existing theories, in mind, the external and internal factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of vitiligo are reviewed, against the background of reported clinical data, experimental studies and existing and potential new therapies. A similar complex mechanism may also lead to some other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Summary Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by an acute onset of severe headache and multi-focal segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries resolving within 12 weeks. Diagnostic criteria include normal or near-normal findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, especially leucocyte levels < 10/mm?. Distinguishing RCVS from primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is essential to avoid unnecessary and sometimes unfavourable immunosuppressive treatment. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical and diagnostic data of 10 RCVS patients who presented in our neurological department from 1 January 2013 to February 2017. The main purpose was to verify whether CSF leucocyte counts < 10/mm? serve to discriminate RCVS from PACNS. Five of six patients who underwent lumbar puncture presented with CSF leucocyte levels ≥ 10/mm?. Two patients had a history of misinterpretation of CSF pleocytosis as cerebral vasculitis and of immunosuppressive treatment. A complete restitution of cerebral vasoconstriction was evident in all. No patient had further cerebral strokes or bleedings without immunosuppressive treatment over more than 12 weeks. Despite the established diagnostic criteria, RCVS can manifest with CSF leucocyte levels > 10/mm?. Careful anamnesis and the response of ?vasculitis-like angiography? to nimodipine given as a test during angiography and as oral medication are key to differentiate RCVS from cerebral vasculitis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although long recognized in microvascular research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory markers are present in human diseases. Since the inflammatory cascade serves as a repair mechanism, the presence of inflammatory markers in patient groups has raised an important question about the mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory cascade (i.e., the mechanisms that cause tissue injury). Using a severe form of inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, for which there is no accepted injury mechanism, we summarize studies that suggest that the powerful pancreatic digestive enzymes play a central role in the destruction of the intestine and other tissues if their compartmentalization in the lumen of the intestine and in the pancreas is compromised. Further, we summarize evidence that uncontrolled degrading enzyme activity in plasma causes proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane receptors and loss of associated cell functions. For example, in a model of metabolic disease with type II diabetes, proteolytic cleavage of the insulin receptor causes the inability of insulin to signal glucose transport across membranes. The evidence suggests that uncontrolled proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity may trigger the mechanism for tissue injury. The significance of such mechanisms remain to be explored in human diseases.

AB  - The successful acquisition of skin sensitisation requires orchestrated cellular and molecular interactions that collectively result in the induction of a cutaneous immune response of the required quality and vigour. Pivotal roles are played by epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), and by the mature immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DC) into which they mature. LC serve as sentinels of the adaptive immune system with responsibility for surveying changes in the local microenvironment and for processing antigen (and chemical allergens) encountered at skin surfaces. Following such encounters LC are mobilised and stimulated to migrate, via afferent lymphatics, to regional lymph nodes. While in transit they lose the properties of antigen processing cells and acquire instead the characteristics of mature DC that are able to interact effectively with, and present antigen to, T lymphocytes. To gain a greater understanding of the molecular events that induce and regulate cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens, we have used microarray transcript profiling and related experimental approaches to characterise changes in gene expression and protein production associated with the development of skin sensitisation. Our attention has focused particularly on changes in the expression of mRNA and protein resulting from the interaction of chemical allergens with DC, and associated with the presentation of antigen to T lymphocytes.

AB  - Five centimeter segments of the linea alba in mature, female, mixed breed dogs were incised and then approximated with either stainless steel fascial staples or size 0 polypropylene suture material. Breaking strength of the linea alba closures was determined at 0 (Phase I, 18 dogs) and at 7,14, and 31 days (Phase II, 18 dogs). Histology and videointeractive planar morphometry were used to evaluate healing of the linea alba. Breaking strength and histologic and morphometric variables were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance in a split plot design. In a clinical trial, 20 cm linea alba incisions were approximated with stainless steel fascial staples after elective ovariohysterectomy in mature, female, mixed breed dogs (Phase III, eight dogs). The dogs were evaluated at 1, 2, 7,14, 31, 90, and 180 days. Linea alba incisions approximated with polypropylene suture material were significantly stronger than linea alba incisions approximated with stainless steel fascial staples on day 0. There was no significant difference between breaking strength values, histologic, and morphometric appearance of linea alba incisions closed with stainless steel fascial staples or polypropylene suture material when compared 7,14, and 31 days after surgery. All of the dogs in the clinical trial appeared to be normal at all evaluation times. Approximation of linea alba incisions with stainless steel fascial staples compares favorably to closure with a simple continuous pattern of polypropylene suture material with regard to breaking strength, clinical, histologic, and morphometric appearance.

Endocrine manifestations of Erdheim?Chester disease (a distinct form of histiocytosis) (Case Report). J Intern Med 1998; 244: 529?35. Erdheim?Chester disease (ECD) is a disorder of unclear aetiology, characterized by exuberant histiocyte proliferation and a variable clinical course. We report the case of a woman with multi-organ involvement secondary to ECD. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hyperprolactinaemia, gonadotropin insufficiency and decreased insulin-like growth factor I levels were present, suggesting hypothalamic?pituitary dysfunction. The high-intensity signal of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was absent on magnetic resonance imaging, but no sellar mass lesions or stalk thickening were apparent. Additionally, our patient had bilateral adrenal enlargement. Even though ECD is a rare cause of neuroendocrine dysfunction or adrenal enlargement, it should be considered in patients with these disorders in the setting of multiorgan disease.

AB  - Abstract: Background. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after living lobar lung transplantation (LT). Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on peripheral blood monocytes, have been demonstrated to correlate with risk of infection in surgical, trauma, and adult transplant patients. In addition, interleukin (IL)-10 has been shown to be a negative regulator of HLA-DR expression. This study investigates whether HLA-DR expression and serum IL-10 levels correlate with the development of pneumonia after pediatric LT. Methods. Thirteen LT recipients were prospectively monitored with blood samples obtained pre-LT (baseline) and post-LT weeks 1?4. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA from frozen serum collected at the same time points as monocyte HLA-DR expression. Correlates of pneumonia were abstracted from the medical record. Results. Monocyte HLA-DR expression declined in 11 of 13 patients in the first week post-LT. Two patients without an initial decline and four others whose HLA-DR expression recovered by week 2 post-LT, did not develop pneumonia or other infection or rejection. Pneumonia was observed in seven patients, six of whom failed to recover their monocyte HLA-DR expression by 2 weeks post-LT. Six of seven patients with pneumonia recovered, and one patient died of aspergillosis. During weeks 1?4, a statistically significant difference was seen in the profile of mean monocyte HLA-DR expression levels, analyzed as percent of baseline, between the patients with and without pneumonia (P=0.002). The greatest difference between groups over time was seen from post-LT weeks 1?2 (P=0.003). In addition, when comparing the values at each week, a significant difference was seen between the two groups at post-LT week 2 (P=0.006) and week 4 (P=0.05). Analysis of IL-10 concentrations revealed that the overall difference between the groups (patients with and without pneumonia) was statistically significant (P=0.014), with a paradoxical positive correlation between HLA-DR expression at post-LT week 4 and IL-10 concentrations. Conclusions. Persistent low monocyte HLA-DR expression was associated with the risk of post-LT pneumonia in these patients. This measurement may be useful for monitoring risk of infection and stratifying patients into higher and lower risk groups. Increased IL-10 levels may be protective for infection in this group of patients. At present it is unknown whether the predictive power of HLA-DR expression is indicative of a global defect in monocytic function or a specific abnormality.

AB  - Over the last 50 years, the significance of the immune system in the development and control of cancer has been much debated. However, recent discoveries provide evidence for a role of immunological mechanisms in the detection and destruction of cancer cells. Forty years ago veterinary oncologists were already investigating the feasibility of treating neoplasia by enhancing anticancer immunity. Unfortunately, this research was hindered by lack of a detailed understanding of cancer immunology, this limited the specificity and success of these early approaches. The great forward strides made in our understanding of onco-immunology in recent years have provided the impetus for a resurgence of interest in anticancer immunotherapy for canine patients. In this article both these initial trials and the exciting novel immunotherapeutics currently in development are reviewed.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes a collection of miscellaneous organisms that have caused disease in poultry or are a public health concern. The less common pathogens implicated in poultry loss included are Staphylococcosis, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, Erysipelas, avian intestinal spirochetosis, tuberculosis. Disease syndromes included in the chapter include beak necrosis, venereal disease of geese, and liver granulomas, but are not identified to a specific organism responsible because of the multifactorial nature of the disease. Staphylococcosis is diagnosed by culturing suspected clinical material including exudate from joints, yolk material, and stab swabs of internal organs. Staphylococcosis can resemble infection with Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, reoviruses, or any other infection of bones or joints that is hatchery-related, associated with mechanical trauma, or causes septicemia. Prevention and control of Enterococcus infections require reducing stress and preventing immunosuppressive diseases and conditions. Proper cleaning and disinfection can reduce environmental enterococcal resident flora to minimize external exposure.

AB  - Summary Both vitiligo and alopecia areata (AA) are associated together, associated with other autoimmune diseases, and autoimmunity is one of the important theories in their etiology. Nail changes are a known association with AA, thus we hypothesized that nail changes can be found in vitiligo patients. On revising the literature, only two types of nail changes were described in association with vitiligo. Our aim was to study the frequency and types of nail changes among vitiligo patients in comparison with normal healthy volunteers. This multi-centric study was carried on 91 patients with vitiligo, as well as 91 normal healthy control subjects who were age- and sex-matched. Nails were examined for changes in nail plates as regards striations, texture, curvature, dystrophy, and pigmentation. The presence or absence of the thumb lunula was also reported. Nail changes were observed in 62 patients (68.1%) and 46 (50.5%) control subjects with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.016). Longitudinal ridging and absent lunula were significantly higher in patients than in the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.037, respectively). Other reported nail abnormalities in the current study included punctate leukonychia, pitting, flag sign, and Terry's nails. Awareness of this association will widen the clinician's perspective to carefully examine the nail changes in vitiligo patients and conversely examine patients with nail changes for vitiligo.

AB  - Aim To evaluate long-term survival and prognostic factors in elderly Mexican patients who have undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Methods The present study was a retrospective cohort analysis of 110 patients aged older than 70 years without head and neck malignancy who underwent PEG between January 2005 and December 2012. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for demographic and clinical variables, and survival was determined by the Kaplan?Meier method. Results Medium age and follow up were 82.45?±?6.6 years and 688.3?±?394.6 days, respectively. The patients who died in the early postoperative period (n?=?6) were older than those who survived. The Karnofsky performance status and lymphocyte count were non-significantly lower in non-survivors. The body mass index and serum albumin level were lower in non-survivors (P?=?0.03 and 0.01, respectively) and Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) was higher. A total of 32 (29%) patients died later in the postoperative period with a mean follow up of 436.2?±?267.4 days. Risk factors for mortality included Karnofsky Performance Status (odds ratio [OR] 9.76, 95% CI: 3.26?29.3), CCI (OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.31?21.41) and postoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.45, 95% CI: 1.71?6.67). Postgastrostomy pneumonia occurred in 36.8% of the patients who died during follow-up (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.6?1.26). Conclusions Karnofsky performance status, Charlson's comorbidity index and postoperative hypoalbuminemia, were independent risk factors for mortality. Modifiable factors are related to nutritional support. Early PEG may help prevent malnutrition and infection. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2015; 15: 19?26.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.
