AB  - Summary The purpose of this prospective study was to enumerate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)+ cells and measure their function using synthetic oligonucleotides enriched in CG dinucleotide motifs (CpG)-induced proliferation within 48?h after trauma in severely injured patients prone to sepsis. Sixteen consecutive trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS)?>?21 and 16 blood donors (controls) were included in this study. Using two-colour flow cytometry, TLR9 expression was detectable intracellularly and also on the surface of B lymphocytes. The surface expression of TLR9 of B lymphocytes from whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with CpG was significantly increased in B cells of severely injured patients prone to sepsis compared to controls. No significant differences could be observed between CpG-induced proliferation of PBMC of severely injured patients prone to sepsis and controls. As a measure of immunosuppression, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression of monocytes of the trauma patients was significantly diminished compared with controls in PBMC and in whole blood. Immunosuppression in the early phase after trauma seems not to be associated with a disturbed sensing of bacterial DNA.

AB  - Abstract. The DNA synthesis time (Ts) of lymphocytes from spleens and lymph nodes of patients with Hodgkin's disease was determined by the double labeling method. 3H-TdR was administered in vivo and removed tissues minced in 14C-TdR in vitro. Lymphocytes from patients with lymphosarcoma and reticulum cell sarcoma were studied in a similar manner. Lymphocytes were divided into A cells, small with non-basophilic cytoplasm, B cells, small with basophilic cytoplasm, C cells, large with non-basophilic cytoplasm, and D cells, large with basophilic cytoplasm. The Ts of splenic lymphocytes, in four samples not containing Reed-Sternberg cells, in hours, was: B 11.3; C, 7.9; D, 8.4; combined, 8.8. the Ts of B lymphocytes was significantly longer than that of C and D lymphocytes. A lymphocytes did not label sufficiently to measure Ts. C and D lymph node lymphocytes and lymphocytes in tissues containing Reed-Sternberg cells had a longer Ts than splenic C and D cells. the former was: B, 12.7; C, 11.7; D, 11.0; combined, 11.8. the latter was: B, 12.2; C, 11.3; D, 11.2; combined, 11.6. the Ts of Reed-Sternberg cells in one specimen of a splenic Hodgkin's tumor was 13.1 hr. Macrophage Ts was 10.7 and 15.1 hr. Lymphosarcoma cell Ts was 14.2 and 14.6 hr. Reticulum cell sarcoma cell Ts was 7.5 and 7.7 hr. The following minimum times were calculated from observation of 3H-TdR only labeled mitotic figures: S to prophase, 71 min; S to metaphase, 75 min; S to telophase, 100 min.

AB  - Abstract Background: The amount of available intracellular zinc is pivotal to regulate many cellular processes, including oxidative stress response and apoptotic mechanisms. Therefore it is not surprising that zinc homeostasis and dyshomeostasis is involved in many physiological and pathological states, respectively. Cell permeable zinc probes allow intracellular applications with microscopy technology, but flow cytometry (FC) applications have been scarcely explored, albeit they can be suited to study zinc homeostasis in different cell types, including rare cells. Methods: We describe a FC method able to estimate intracellular zinc ion availability and the intracellular capability to activate a zinc signal after treatment with an NO-donor (AcOM-DEA/NO) in human PBMCs, using the fluorescent zinc-specific probe, Zinpyr-1 (ZP1), alone or in association with CD4-PE and CD8-Cychrome mAb. Results: This method was able to detect an increase/decrease of intracellular zinc available in human fresh cultured PBMC and in immune subsets using AcOM-DEA/NO or TPEN, respectively. ZP1 mean fluorescence on gated histograms was sensitive to the amount of zinc added in the culture medium and significantly correlated to metallothioneins and total intracellular zinc. Conclusions: FC applications using ZP1 may be a fast and useful tool to study zinc homeostasis in immune cells. ? 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that increased lymphocyte apoptosis (Ao) detected in peripheral blood T?cells from burn patients appears to contribute to decreased lymphocyte immunoresponsiveness. However, while it is known that sepsis induces a marked depression in the splenocyte immune response (i.e. decreased interleukin-2, interferon-? production and proliferation) in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), it is unknown whether this depression is associated with an increase in inducible Ao and if so, which mediators control this process. To assess this, splenocytes were harvested from mice at 24?hr (a period associated with decreased Con A response) after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis [caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] or sham-CLP (Sham) and then stimulated with 2Â·5??g Con A/ml (24?hr). Septic mouse splenocytes stimulated with Con A, while not showing a change in their phenotypic make-up, did exhibit a marked increase in the percentage of splenocyte that were Ao+ which was associated with altered cytokine release. This appears to be due to an increase in the percentage of Ao+ cells in the CD4+ CD8? population and was associated with enhanced Fas antigen expression as well as an increase in mRNA for the Fas?FasL gene family. To determine if the changes in Ao are due to either endotoxin (a product of Gram-negative bacteria seen in CLP mice) or the expression of Fas ligand (FasL; a mediator of activation-induced lymphocyte Ao), a second set of studies examining Con A-inducible Ao was performed with splenocytes harvested from septic endotoxin-tolerant C3H/HeJ and the FasL-deficient C3H/HeJ-Fasl?gld mice. The results show that increased splenocyte Ao detected following CLP is due to a FasL-mediated process and not to endotoxin. Thus the inadvertent up-regulation of FasL-mediated splenocyte Ao may contribute to the depression of splenocyte immune responses seen during polymicrobial sepsis.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole in dogs with diagnosis of meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology. Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.

AB  - Summary Objective PentraxinÂ 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all PÂ <Â 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62Â ngÂ mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]Â 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR]Â 1.51; 95%Â [CI]Â 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HRÂ 1.23; 95%Â [CI]Â 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HRÂ 1.33; 95%Â [CI]Â 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/Î´ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naÃ¯ve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, nÂ =Â 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, nÂ =Â 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (PÂ <Â 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factorsÂ >Â the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3Â years (range: 54?75Â years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma nÂ =Â 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) nÂ =Â 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma nÂ =Â 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5Â years (range: 51?69Â years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Recently, it has been hypothesized that the BSE-causing agent PrPSc can infect sheep, making these animals a possible source of infection for man. Furthermore, experimental studies in inoculated sheep have demonstrated that PrPSc is not only present in neuronal tissue, but also in lymphoid tissue. Therefore, ovine tonsils are considered as high-risk material and consequently have to be removed after slaughter. The present study is part of an elaborate project in which anatomical, histological and immunological aspects of ovine tonsils are studied within the framework of BSE/TSE research. The tongues of two sheep of 9-months-old were collected immediately after slaughter. The lingual root between the base of the epiglottis and the torus linguae was dissected and the 4.5?cm wide and 8?cm long sample was cut into 24 pieces which were subsequently fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. From each tissue block, ten 8-?m-thick sections with 1000??m interval were cut and stained with eosin?haematoxylin. Microscopic analysis revealed that lymphocytes are mainly present at the lateral side of the tongue forming numerous small aggregates, while in the more central part the amount of aggregates was lower. In both lateral and central parts, the aggregations were located in an area ranging from 1?2?cm till 6?cm rostral to the epiglottis. These lymphatic clusters were in general smaller than the lymphatic nodules seen in the other pharyngeal lymphoid tissue, and a differentiation into secondary nodules was never observed. The epithelium covering these lymphocyte aggregations was a stratified squamous epithelium without infiltration of lymphocytes. It was concluded that the tonsilla lingualis in sheep consists of scattered lymphocyte aggregations without forming a well-defined tonsillar organization. Further studies are planned to examine the tongues of more sheep and to determine the presence of dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells and different B- and T-cell populations. This study was supported by the BOF project grant #011B4101 of Ghent University.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatic granuloma is an uncommon condition considered to be a benign, reactive lesion that usually affects the tongue. The exact pathogenesis implicated in the development of this lesion is not clear. However, trauma has been found to be a contributing factor in a majority of the cases. Clinically, it often presents as an ulceration or an indurated submucosal mass. Microscopically, it is characterized by a diffuse polymorphic cell infiltrate composed predominantly of eosinophils extending deep into the submucosa causing degeneration of the underlying muscle. Recognition of the lesion is important because it often mimics oral squamous cell carcinoma. But traumatic granuloma is self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously. This paper describes a case of traumatic granuloma on the dorsal surface of tongue in a 62-year-old woman. The clinical aspects, pathogenesis and histopathology of this uncommon lesion are discussed with an emphasis on its benign, self-limiting nature.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - Summary As more patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving, despite severe immune suppression, clinicians are faced with atypical manifestations of both common and uncommon dermatoses. A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45Â cells/?L. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.
