AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a leading cause of vision loss in horses. Objectives To assess the prognosis and impact of ERU on affected horses and their owners by evaluating the signalment, treatment and outcome (including the loss of use, vision assessment and economic loss). Study design Retrospective impact study. Methods Medical records of horses presenting to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Health Complex (NCSU-VHC) with ERU between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Signalment, clinical signs, ophthalmic examination findings, treatments and outcomes were evaluated. Owner questionnaires were completed regarding vision, job/role, monetary value, diagnostic and treatment costs, concurrent illness and outcomes. Results Records of 224 horses (338 eyes) with ERU were reviewed. There was an overrepresentation of Appaloosas (54; 24.1%), Hanoverians (11; 4.9%) and other Warmbloods (13; 5.8%). Ninety-six eyes (28.4%) were diagnosed as blind and 38 eyes (11.2%) with glaucoma on initial evaluation. Leptospirosis titres of serum and/or aqueous humour were obtained in 88 horses and were positive in 40 horses (45.5%), with L. pomona being the most frequently isolated serovar. Globe loss at the NCSU-VHC occurred in 41 ERU eyes (12.1% of total). Owner questionnaires were evaluated in 194 horses (86.6%) and 91 horses (46.9%) were reported blind in the affected eye(s). Fifty-seven horses (29.4%) did not return to their previous role, while 61 (31.4%) performed at a reduced level. Equine recurrent uveitis decreased the monetary value of 164 horses. Twenty-nine horses (14.9%) were euthanised and 37 (19.1%) underwent change in ownership as a direct result of ERU. Conclusions The impact of ERU is attributed to the high frequency of blindness, globe loss and loss of function. Euthanasia and change of ownership are common sequelae to the progressive nature of ERU. These factors, along with financial costs of the disease, have a significant impact on affected horses and their owners. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Over time, various treatment modalities for spinal cord injury have been trialed, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods. Among these, replacement of the injured neural and paraneural tissues via cellular transplantation of neural and mesenchymal stem cells has been the most attractive. Extensive experimental studies have been done to identify the safety and effectiveness of this transplantation in animal and human models. Herein, we review the literature for studies conducted, with a focus on the human-related studies, recruitment, isolation, and transplantation, of these multipotent stem cells, and associated outcomes.

AB  - A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented with an eczematous patch on the left proximal inner arm of 12 years duration. She had previously been treated with emollients and topical steroids without complete resolution. The patient denied constitutional symptoms but did note eczematous patches on her buttocks of one-year duration and new eczematous patches on her inner left thigh and right inner upper arm. Upon exam, all lesions were slightly scaly without induration. The primary lesion was a poikilodermatous 4???10?cm rough plaque. No lymphadenopathy was noted. A total of five lesional biopsies were obtained. All of the biopsies demonstrated a superficial infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei and prominent epidermotropism including the formation of Pautrier?s microabcesses. The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was rendered. This case is significant for its onset at two years of age, the benignity of its course over a 12 year period and the long duration before definitive diagnosis was obtained. Mycosis fungoides needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of recalcitrant eczematous disease even in young children.

AB  - Abstract Anti-infectives used to treat chronic exuding wounds are diluted by wound exudates, absorbed into dressings, metabolised by proteases and destroyed by pH. In order to mimic such effects of exudates, the efficacy of six topical wound agents was assessed undiluted and at 10% concentrations, including povidone-iodine ointment and a silver-impregnated wound dressing, to remove biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-species biofilms of Candida albicans and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reactor. Povidone-iodine was also diluted to 3·3% and 33·3% of the commercial concentrations. Viable microorganisms in each preparation were quantified by colony count. No viable P. aeruginosa biofilm material was recovered after 4 and 24 hours of treatment with povidone-iodine ointment at the 100% and 10% concentrations. No C. albicans/MRSA biofilm material was recovered after 4 and 24 hours of treatment with povidone-iodine ointment at the 100% concentration. In general, following dilution, povidone-iodine ointment appeared to exhibit greater biofilm removal than the other agents tested. Further research involving different microorganisms in vitro and in vivo over a longer period of time will help elucidate the full potential of povidone-iodine ointment and liposomal hydrogel.

AB  - Abstract Despite approaches in regenerative medicine using stem cells, bio-engineered scaffolds, and targeted drug delivery to enhance human tissue repair, clinicians remain unable to regenerate large-scale, multi-tissue defects in situ. The study of regenerative biology using mammalian models of complex tissue regeneration offers an opportunity to discover key factors that stimulate a regenerative rather than fibrotic response to injury. For example, although primates and rodents can regenerate their distal digit tips, they heal more proximal amputations with scar tissue. Rabbits and African spiny mice re-grow tissue to fill large musculoskeletal defects through their ear pinna, while other mammals fail to regenerate identical defects and instead heal ear holes through fibrotic repair. This Review explores the utility of these comparative healing models using the spiny mouse ear pinna and the mouse digit tip to consider how mechanistic insight into reparative regeneration might serve to advance regenerative medicine. Specifically, we consider how inflammation and immunity, extracellular matrix composition, and controlled cell proliferation intersect to establish a pro-regenerative microenvironment in response to injuries. Understanding how some mammals naturally regenerate complex tissue can provide a blueprint for how we might manipulate the injury microenvironment to enhance regenerative abilities in humans.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

AB  - Introduction: To report an uncommon case of mycosis fungoides in a 62-year-old female. Case presentation: A 62-year-old Black female presented to our clinic with a wide spread of hyper-pigmented erythematous grayish plaques on trunk, extremities and face. There were no associated systemic illnesses and laboratory work was otherwise within normal range. Two skin biopsies were taken from the trunk and extremity. Both of the biopsies reveal similar features of coexisting like lichen planus and mycosis fungoides. There was interface dermatitis, vacuolar degeneration, prominent colloid body formation and lichenoid lymphonocytic inflammation through out the dermis. Epidermis was atrophic with overlying hyper and parakeratosis. There were many areas of epidermotrophism with collections of atypical lymphocytes. There was also marked pigmentory incontinence in the dermis. Comment: We present an uncommon case of mycosis fungoides with changes of lichen planus. It is important familiarise oneself with uncommon presentations of mycosis fungoides. It may be worthwhile to look for mycosis fungoides, while reviewing a classical case of lichen planus with clinical presentation of lichen planus.

AB  - Abstract Background Fibrosis, a proliferative response of fibrocytes after tissue injury, is a common sequela of external radiotherapy and can vary greatly among patients even in the absence of DNA repair syndromes, due to their different intrinsic radiosensitivity. Fibrosis is also a serious cosmetic problem for patients, and in some cases it can also imply pain. Case Here, we report a case of a severe fibrosis 2 years after breast conserving surgery and postoperative 3D conformal breast irradiation. Furthermore, our patient had the suspicion of tumour recurrence. Our examinations were aimed at diagnosing recurrence or the lack of recurrence and investigating whether the symptoms occurred due to overdosing or extreme intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore, examining the patients' radiosensitivity, a cytogenetic test was performed, which revealed the patient's increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation, and therefore we rejected the prospect of overdosage. As a solution for the fibrosis, mastectomy was effectuated, and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction. Conclusions We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach to manage fibrosis and propose cytogenetic markers to be used as predictors to identify patients who most likely benefit from a certain therapeutic regimen in terms of reduction of therapy-related side effects.

Radiography showed an unusually large cyst in the distal femur. Diagnostic arthroscopy of the stifle did not reveal any significant abnormalities. An extra-articular transcortical approach to the cyst was performed for drainage, curettage, and provision of an autologous, cancellous bone graft, gentamicin-impregnated collagen fleeces and injectable steroid. The horse returned to a higher level of competitive dressage than prior to surgery. This report describes a large cyst in the distal femur of a horse.

AB  - Abstract A 25-year-old Thai housewife had a history of tuberculosis of the lymph nodes for six years that had been successfully treated with a course of anti-TB drugs. She developed several red, circumscribed, infiltrative plaques composed of umbilicated papules and pustules on her face and upper part of the body with cervical lymphadenopathy six months later. A pus smear from the lesion grew acid fast bacilli (AFB). Histopathological examination showed a mixed cell granuloma suggestive of infection. A T cell study showed a low CD4 count, and multi skin tests indicated cutaneous anergy. Culture from a biopsy specimen taken from the skin lesion grew M.chelonae; the cultures from blood, urine, and bone marrow. The lesions were not responsive to an anti TB drug given for 2 months based upon the results of the AFB positive pus smear before the culture and sensitivity reports were obtained. Since then the patient was treated with antibiotics according to the results of the sensitivity tests. A combination of amikacin and clarithromycin was started and hyperthermic therapy was later added with a partial response. Based upon the sensitivity test, kanamycin was introduced but had to be stopped because of ototoxicity. Sparfloxacin was used with an effective result but was discontinued for economic reasons. Finally, clarithromycin in combination with clofazimine and cryotherapy were given for a year before the lesions healed completely. It took a three years duration for the total course of treatment for this patient. She is still in remission after two years of follow-up period. This extensive cutaneous M.chelonae infection needed a prolonged combination of antibiotics with the addition of cryotherapy for the non-responsive lesions.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction mediated by allergen specific T-lymphocytes. Allergen exposure leads to the activation of specific T-lymphocytes, which subsequently start to produce and release a vast array of cytokines and chemokines. However, the list of relevant genes taking part in the elicitation phase of contact dermatitis is not complete. In this study, we evaluate the use of the high-density microarray technology, which enable us to assess the global gene expression in allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We included 3 chromium-allergic patients and 3 non-allergic controls in the study. Cultures of PBMC were established from each participant and stimulated with 100?ug/ul CrCl3 or media alone. The cell cultures were grown for 24 hours and the gene expression was analysed using an Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Array. Of the genes that exhibited differences of expression (p?<?0.01) in allergen-activated PBMC from patients compared to controls, 54%(159/294) displayed increased activity and 46%(136/294) displayed decreased activity. Of the 159 up-regulated genes, 41 genes had a fold change above 1.50 and 30 genes among the 136 down-regulated genes had a fold change below -1.5. A significant number of the genes that showed differential expression in the cell cultures established from the allergic patients are known to be involved in immune responses and inflammation. The data indicates that the method of microarrays is a valuable tool for investigating the gene expression profile in our model system for allergic contact dermatitis.

AB  - Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis with cutaneous, skeletal, ocular, neurological, and dental abnormalities. It has been mapped to chromosome Xq28 encoding the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). NEMO regulates many genes, such as those that prevent apoptosis. IP is usually lethal in males. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are able to survive due to one normal X chromosome. We report a case of a male who presented after birth with multiple vesicles in a linear distribution on the calf progressing to persistent hyperpigmentation. At one month of age a punch biopsy showed verrucous hyperplasia with mild hypergranulosis, necrotic dyskeratinocytes and a lichenoid infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils and melanophages. A diagnosis of IP was rendered. No additional physical findings were noted. The patient was evaluated for Klinefelter syndrome. While his karyotype was 46, XY by conventional cytogenetics, a dual color interphase FISH detected 92.5% 46, XY and 6.5% 47, XXY. Our patient?s unique genetic array allowed a mechanism to escape and otherwise fatal disorder. This case illustrates the potential utility of using FISH analysis to detect Klinefelter syndrome in a male patient with IP and normal conventional chromosomal analysis.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

AB  - Abstract A 37-year-old male presented with a cauliflower-like tumor in the right buccal mucosa, leukoplakia of the tongue and esophagus, and keratotic papules or plaques on the extremities including bilateral palms and soles, associated with borderline diabetes mellitus and a repeated history of infections. A multi-system keratinizing abnormality was suspected, although no distinct disease category has been found showing similar involvements.

AB  - Abstract While laboratory small animal models of cachexia and sarcopenia are well-suited and critical for studying mechanisms and early pre-clinical phases for potential treatments, they are not similar enough to the human conditions to always be good predictors for results in human clinical trials. As a result, translational failures can occur when large-scale human clinical trials are conducted on drugs, even when they appear promising in pre-clinical studies in rodent models. What is needed is a way to more efficiently and successfully translate information gained from basic science and rodent research into human clinical trials that produce effective approved drugs. Naturally-occurring cachexia and sarcopenia in companion animals is a more representative model of human disease that can serve as a stepping stone between basic science and human clinical trials. Many of the common diseases of humans also affect companion animals, particularly pet dogs and cats. Pet dogs and cats commonly develop heart failure, cancer, and kidney disease, as well as acute trauma or illness. The population of elderly companion animals also is increasing as pets' lifespans have become longer. As a result, both cachexia and sarcopenia are very common in companion animals. Studying these conditions in dogs and cats ? either in colonies or in animal clinical trials - can help to identify successful treatments that can benefit both humans and companion animals.

AB  - Abstract Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and carry a dismal prognosis. Despite aggressive therapy with maximal safe surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors invariably are refractory to or become resistant to treatment and recur. Gliomas are highly infiltrative cancers and display remarkable genetic heterogeneity making them challenging to treat. Recent progress has been made in understanding the molecular and genetic composition of these tumors and from this, promising new targets for therapy have emerged. In particular, anti-angiogenesis therapies have led to modest success in disease control. In addition, the growing body of research in cancer immunology as well as cancer stem cells has made inroads in our understanding of tumorgenesis. Translational research has been particularly crucial to the development of these therapies as much preclinical and clinical work is needed to develop the rationale for treatments, to develop biomarkers of drug activity and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance. This brief overview will discuss some of the pivotal advances made in the pursuit of improved outcomes and survival for patients with this devastating disease.

AB  - Background and Objectives Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC. Methods Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (<1 year) recurrence and mortality. Results Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size?>?10?cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP)?>?200?ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio?>?3 and prognostic nutritional index?<?40 were predictors of early recurrence while PLR?>?180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses. Conclusions Tumor size?>?10?cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP?>?200?ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding ?futile surgery? in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients.
