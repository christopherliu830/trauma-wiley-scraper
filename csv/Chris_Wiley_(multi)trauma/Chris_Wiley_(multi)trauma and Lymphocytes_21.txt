AB  - Background and Objectives Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC. Methods Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (<1 year) recurrence and mortality. Results Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size?>?10?cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP)?>?200?ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio?>?3 and prognostic nutritional index?<?40 were predictors of early recurrence while PLR?>?180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses. Conclusions Tumor size?>?10?cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP?>?200?ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding ?futile surgery? in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Abstract The myeloproliferative neoplasms represent a diverse group of hematologic malignancies that have been the subject of intense investigation over the last decade. Although clinical trials of the much anticipated small molecule inhibitors of Janus kinase 2 have shown that these experimental agents are successful in palliating many of the symptoms associated with the myeloproliferative neoplasms, they have not been reported to affect the disease initiating hematopoietic stem cell population or to alter the natural history of these disorders. Investigators remain optimistic that new information about the genetic and cellular origins gained from the efforts of numerous laboratories will ultimately translate in to the identification of new drug targets and more effective therapies. We hypothesize that ultimately, the use of combinations of drugs including chromatin modifying agents, immunomodulatory agents, anti-apoptotic agents, cellular therapies and monoclonal antibodies will be required to effectively treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Malnutrition is frequent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, infections, and death. We determined the prevalence of malnutrition by various methods and its clinical importance in patients with cirrhosis. Methods Consecutive patients of cirrhosis from August 2013 to February 2015 were assessed. Nutritional status was assessed by traditional model (mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, serum albumin, creatinine height index, total lymphocyte count), handgrip, and body composition analysis measuring skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. All patients were followed up for 12 months to assess the outcome. Results 247 patients (age 42.10?±?10.14?years, 81% male) were included in the study. Etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol in 53% patients. Prevalence of malnutrition was 59.5% according to traditional model, 66.8% by body composition analysis and 71.4% by handgrip. Nutritional status was poor in alcoholic cirrhotics versus nonalcoholics as assessed by triceps skinfold thickness (9.33?±?2.9 vs 11.64?±?3.5?mm; P?=?0.001), serum albumin (25.1?±?4 vs 28.1?±?4?g/L; P?=?0.001), and body fat mass (7.6?±?3.1 vs 8.7?±?3.3?kg; P?=?0.008). Prevalence of malnutrition was 12/27 (44.5%), 96/131 (73.3%) and 84/89 (94.4%) in Child's class A, B, and C respectively. Complications requiring hospitalization (71.3% vs 38.2%; 0.002) and mortality (41.1% vs 18.2%; P?=?0.001) were more in malnourished patients compared to well nourished. Nutritional assessment parameters significantly correlated with the liver disease severity (P?<?0.05). Conclusions Prevalence of malnutrition is high in patients with cirrhosis. It is associated with increased complications and mortality.

AB  - Abstract The Lions Eye Bank of South Australia was established six years ago and has collected corneas from 790 donors. The consent rate is currently 82% of requests made. Two-thirds of donors have been male, with mean donor age/year varying from 54 to 64 years (range two to 93 years). Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, trauma and haemorrhage account for 80% of all donor deaths. Mean death to enucleation time is five hours. Corneas assessed as being of excellent or very good quality are released preferentially from the bank; those with central endothelial cell counts of less than 1500 cells/mm2 are discarded. Fewer than 1% of donors have returned a positive result for HIV or hepatitis B. Of the 1580 corneas collected by the bank, 863 (55%) have been used for transplantation with a primary non-function rate of 0.46%. The evolving policies, logistics of operation and methodologies employed by the bank are described in detail.

AB  - Summary The ability to cure increasing numbers of individuals for malignant and non-malignant diseases with the use of stem cell transplantation has resulted in a growing number of long-term survivors with unique medical issues. Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) continues to be a significant problem in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting and, as we continue to use alternative stem cell sources and attempt to modulate the immune system to increase an anti-tumour effect, we will probably see rising numbers of patients with this complication. The capacity to treat this problem and improve both the immediate quality of life as well as long-term effects is imperative and requires the ability of haematologists/oncologists to identify chronic GvHD and its multi-organ system presentations. We describe the risk factors for developing chronic GvHD, its presentation and the current treatment options for both initial therapy and secondary treatment.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Summary Patient posture refers to head, trunk, and tail position in space, with equal distribution of weight between limbs, to maintain balance. Note that posture is age specific. Newborn kittens and puppies lack the ability to maintain the body, as a whole, in an upright position. However, by one month of age, the posture of a pediatric patient should mirror that of an adult. Abnormal posture may be due to skeletal, muscular, and/or nervous system dysfunction. A head tilt is a specific type of abnormal posture that occurs with frequency in clinical practice. In dogs and cats, head tilts commonly result from infectious or inflammatory middle or inner ear disease, neurologic insult, or ischemic injury. Head tilts may occur in isolation; however, more commonly they are concurrent with other manifestations of neurologic disease, including ataxia, circling, facial nerve paralysis, falling, leaning, rolling, nystagmus, and/or positional strabismus. The presence of one or more of these clinical signs facilitates prioritization of differentials. This chapter cannot provide an exhaustive review of each clinical sign and differential diagnosis. Instead, the chapter emphasizes those conditions that are most commonly seen in clinical practice: peripheral vestibular syndrome, as caused by otitis media, otitis interna, and old dog vestibular syndrome; central vestibular syndrome, as caused by intracranial neoplasia and metronidazole toxicity; as well as canine hypothyroidism, which causes both.

AB  - With the advance of our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of the immune system and inflammatory process, biological modulators, such as anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, are increasingly used in the treatment of immune disorders and hematogenous neoplasm. Side effects of those biological modulators, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichenoid drug reaction, acute folliculitis, and superficial granuloma annulare, have been reported. Recently, we encountered two patients who developed interstitial granulomatous drug reaction while receiving anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. The patients, a 48 year-old male and a 54 year-old female, both have severe rheumatoid arthritis and responded poorly to conventional therapies, received Remicade (Infliximab). Pruritic erythematous skin eruptions developed on the trunk and extremities one month after starting the therapy. The lesions are multiple irritated papules and plaques; some are targetoid, measuring several centimeters, with raised borders. Skin biopsies showed an interstitial granulomatous infiltrate in the mid- and deep dermis. The infiltrate is composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils, palisade around degenerating collagen. Pathological diagnosis was drug-induced interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. Discontinuation of Remicade led to resolution of the skin lesions in both patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a drug eruption caused by anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

AB  - Rosai-Dorfman disease, or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), is a rare benign disease of unknown etiology that involves the cervical lymph nodes. Histologic findings include emperiopolesis of lymphocytes and S-100 protein positivity. Extranodal involvement occurs in 30?40% of cases, often involving skin. However, cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease without lymph node involvement is uncommon. We describe a case of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease and discuss its clinical and histopathologic findings. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-year history of a slowly enlarging violaceous mass on the mid-upper abdomen. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma two-year ago and was asymptomatic without any systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed a large, violaceous mass of mid-upper abdomen with several violaceous nodules surrounding the periphery. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Punch biopsy showed diffuse dermal infiltrates composed of central xanthomatous cells surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Focal germinal center was noted. Immunostaining revealed strong S-100 and CD68 reactivity of central xanthomatous cells and kappa and lambda polyclonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Special stains for infectious disorder were negative. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign reactive process, often under-recognized due to lack of systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. A high index of diagnostic awareness is required for its recognition.

AB  - A 32-year-old immunocompromised African American male on multiple medications with a history of psoriasis and prurigo nodularis presented with a new generalized, painful, pruritic, papular eruption. Histologic sections revealed epidermal changes of lichen simplex chronicus with superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and frequent eosinophils. Two important histological features also identified were eosinophilic panniculitis and prominent perineural eosinophilic infiltrate with focal areas showing eosinophils extending into the substance of the nerve. A right thigh sample was also sent for Gram stain, AFB and fungal cultures, all of which were negative. Laboratory findings at this time were significant for a peripheral blood eosinophilia. The patients? topical corticosteroid prescription was increased with minimal relief. Hypereosinophilic syndrome with dermatoses in HIV infected patients is well documented. We present a patient with advanced AIDS, generalized painful, pruritic, papular rash and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The pattern of inflammation on HIV dermatoses seen in our patient not previously described in the literature is the perineural eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic panniculitis. We propose two possible explanations for these histological findings: (1) hypereosinophilic syndrome in AIDS patients is a heterogeneous disorder and may include eosinophilic neuritis with panniculitis, or (2) an exuberant drug reaction.

AB  - The inconsistent use of the term ?erythema annulare centrifugum? has created confusion, in that it has been applied to a group of distinct diseases as if they were a single condition. The literature becomes more ambiguous when different names are given to annular eruptions that have a similar pathogenesis. We present two neonates who presented at birth with similar diffuse erythematous annular eruptions, but differed in their serologic and histopathologic findings. The first child was otherwise healthy and had normal laboratories findings that excluded both infectious and autoimmune diseases. His biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate throughout the entire dermis that was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous eosinophils. The second neonate had elevated anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, thrombocytopenia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. His biopsy showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. There was a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate that extended throughout the dermis which consisted primarily of nuclear debris. Within the cytoplasm of the few intact histiocytes and neutrophils, were hematoxylin bodies, giving these cells the appearance of LE cells. We discuss the clinical and histopathological findings in these two neonates and attempt to clarify the nomenclature pertaining to the annular erythemas.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - A 61-year-old female presented with blurry vision. Questioning revealed ?Flu-like? symptoms preceding the blurry vision by two weeks. An ophthalmologist diagnosed anterior granulomatous dermatitis, which improved with prednisolone drops. One month later, an ?itchy rash? and constitutional symptoms including fever, night sweats, and weight loss were reported. Physical examination revealed a viral-type maculopapular eruption over the trunk and proximal extremities. A few weeks later, repeat examination showed progression to a diffuse, reddish-brown, slightly edematous, papular eruption. Lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia, a polyclonal gammopathy, and an elevated ESR. Punch biopsies on two occasions showed a proliferation of mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytic cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. Emperipolesis was easily demonstrated. A background of plasma cells and small lymphocytes were noted. Stains for organisms were negative, and polarizable material was not present. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes marked with S-100 but were negative for CD1a. A diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai Dorfman was made. The cutaneous symptoms improved over six months without medical therapy. Cutaneous Rosai Dorfman disease with constitutional symptoms and laboratory evidence of systemic involvement but without lymphadenopathy has not been previously described. This unusual case suggests that a wider spectrum of disease presentation may exist.

AB  - Abstract Background We aim to study the level of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous of post-vitrectomy eyes. Methods Aqueous samples were obtained from post-vitrectomy eyes that underwent cataract surgery. Samples from age-related cataract patients were also collected as controls. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by array-based multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and microparticle-based multiplex cytokine assay. Results Eighteen post-vitrectomy eyes from 18 patients were included; all received one vitrectomy with gas injection for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The mean interval between vitrectomy and cataract surgery was 22.33?months (range 6 to 80). Primary results show that in post-vitrectomy eyes the levels of many cytokines, such as B-lymphocyte chemo-attractant, I-309, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, were higher than control. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly elevated in post-vitrectomy eyes, even after the subjects were divided by their refractive state. Conclusions The concentrations of some cytokines were increased in the anterior chambers of post-vitrectomy eyes even a long time after vitreous surgery. This surge in post-operative cytokines might cause changing in the micro-environment of the anterior, and this might contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma or fasten the development of cataract in these eyes.

AB  - Skin biopsies of 8 patients diagnosed with herpetic folliculitis by light microscopy were retrieved from the files of the UCSF Dermatopathology Service. Clinical and microscopical features were reviewed and tabulated, and PCR analysis was employed to seek DNA sequences specific for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The study group included 4 women and 4 men, ages 15 to 54. Five patients (62%) were immunosuppressed, with underlying conditions including HIV infection, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus with polyarteritis nodosa. Microscopically, herpetic cytopathic changes involved the isthmus in 7/8 cases (87%), and involved the sebaceous apparatus in 4/8 cases (50%). Herpetic viropathic changes were not found within eccrine epithelium. A moderate to dense perifollicular infiltrate, comprised mostly of lymphocytes, was evident in 7/8 cases (87%). After PCR expansion of genetic material extracted from the original paraffin blocks, VZV-specific DNA sequences were detected in 8/8 cases. We conclude that herpetic folliculitis is a consequence of VZV infection. Because follicular herpetic infection is often accompanied by a dense perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate, the microscopical presentation can simulate inflammatory skin diseases such as lupus erythematosus. Level sections may be required for a specific diagnosis to be made.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, due to a poorly understood combination of genetic, environmental, and immune factors. The JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program recovers transplantation quality pancreas from organ donors throughout the USA. In addition to recovery of donors with T1D, non-diabetic donors include those with islet autoantibodies. Donors with type 2 diabetes and other conditions are also recovered to aid investigations directed at the full spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting beta cells. One central processing laboratory conducts standardized procedures for sample processing, storage, and distribution, intended for current and future cutting edge investigations. Baseline histology characterizations are performed on the pancreatic samples, with images of the staining results provided though whole-slide digital scans. Uniquely, these high-grade biospecimens are provided without expense to investigators, working worldwide, seeking methods for disease prevention and reversal strategies. Collaborative working groups are highly encouraged, bringing together multiple investigators with different expertise to foster collaborations in several areas of critical need. This mini-review will provide some key histopathological findings emanating from the nPOD collection, including the heterogeneity of beta cell loss and islet inflammation (insulitis), beta cell mass, insulin-producing beta cells in chronic T1D, and pancreas weight reductions at disease onset. Analysis of variations in histopathology observed from these organ donors could provide for mechanistic differences related to etiological agents and serve an important function in terms of identifying the heterogeneity of T1D.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare yet potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity via autoantibody formation has been associated with idiopathic TTP; however, specific triggers are poorly defined. Previous studies have reported seasonal associations of TTP, with warm-weather seasons appearing to have the strongest predilection. We characterized the seasonal distribution of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP at our multi-hospital institution. Methods: Apheresis records from 2005?2012 were queried for patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP, accompanying pre-plasmapheresis ADAMTS13 activity <10%, and no other explanations for thrombotic microangiopathy. Date of admission and ADAMTS13 activity were collected. Both initial episodes and relapses in patients whose initial episodes occurred since 2005 were included in the analysis. Goodness-of-fit chi-square analysis was performed and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: Of 237 consecutive new patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of TTP, 73 patients met inclusion criteria and had a total of 110 unique presentations for either initial TTP episodes or TTP relapses. Sixteen patients had 37 relapses of their idiopathic TTP (range 1?7). No statistically significant seasonal or monthly associations were identified with either initial or any TTP episodes. Conclusion: A seasonal association of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP was not observed. Unknown variables may explain previous observations of seasonal associations of idiopathic TTP in other regions of the United States. Thus, individual institutions should characterize their own seasonal distributions of idiopathic TTP as part of the exploration of possible disease triggers in their respective areas. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Natural cytotoxicity, mediated by natural killer (NK) cells and cells with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity, is believed to play an important role in host anti-cancer defense mechanisms. METHODS The authors critically review recent publications on the role of natural cytotoxicity in patients with cancer. RESULTS In patients with cancer, several studies have noted variations in the numbers and activity of NK and cells with LAK activity in different body compartments. NK cell activity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) is higher than that found in lymph nodes and within tumors, and this appears to be due to the presence of suppressor factors. The natural cytotoxicity of PBLs in patients with different types of cancers varies. However, there appears to be a trend for natural cytotoxicity to be reduced in certain cancer patients, possibly related to tumor volume or dissemination. Anti-cancer treatments (e.g., surgery, hormonal modulation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) can also result in suppression of natural cytotoxicity, although the long-term effect on response to treatment and development of metastases is at present unknown. CONCLUSIONS NK and LAK cells, through the use of immune biologic modifiers, have been demonstrated to have a therapeutic role in the treatment of human cancers. Further studies are required to determine the optimal dosages and combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, the timing of surgery, and the adjuvant use of immune biologic response modifiers. An increasing awareness and understanding of this field, may allow for the future development of anti-cancer therapies. Cancer 1996;77:1226-43.

AB  - Background In preclinical studies with cynomolgus macaques, it is common to have one or more females presenting with menses. Published literature indicates that the blood lost during menses causes decreases in red blood cell mass variables (RBC, HGB, and HCT), which would be a confounding factor in the interpretation of drug-related effects on clinical pathology data, but no scientific data have been published to support this claim. Objectives This investigation was conducted to determine if the amount of blood lost during menses in cynomolgus macaques has an effect on routine hematology and serum chemistry variables. Methods Ten female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), 5 to 6.5 years old, were observed daily during approximately 3 months (97 days) for the presence of menses. Hematology and serum chemistry variables were evaluated twice weekly. Results The results indicated that menstruation affects the erythrogram including RBC, HGB, HCT, MCHC, MCV, reticulocyte count, RDW, the leukogram including neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and chemistry variables, including GGT activity, and the concentrations of total proteins, albumin, globulins, and calcium. The magnitude of the effect of menstruation on susceptible variables is dependent on the duration of the menstrual phase. Macaques with menstrual phases lasting ≥ 7 days are more likely to develop changes in variables related to chronic blood loss. Conclusions In preclinical toxicology studies with cynomolgus macaques, interpretation of changes in several commonly evaluated hematology and serum chemistry variables requires adequate clinical observation and documentation concerning presence and duration of menses. There is a concern that macaques with long menstrual cycles can develop iron deficiency anemia due to chronic menstrual blood loss.
