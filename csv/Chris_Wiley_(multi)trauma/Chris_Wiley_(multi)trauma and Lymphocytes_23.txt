AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Cases were solicited from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology Diplomate listserv. Medical records of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma diagnosed via a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry with or without analysis of polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, chemotherapy protocol, response to treatment, date of first progression, rescue therapies and date and cause of death or last follow-up visit were collected. Results Twenty cases were included. Males and small breed dogs were over-represented. Frequent clinical signs included weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most lymphomas were T-cell phenotype (95%), and epitheliotropism was commonly described (60%). Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement or both were frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Two dogs had resection of an intestinal mass, and all dogs were treated with chemotherapy; chlorambucil and prednisone were most commonly prescribed. Overall response rate was 70%, and median survival time was 424?days (95% confidence interval: 105 to 1206?days). Clinical Significance Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma appears to be a rare condition in dogs, and treatment with chemotherapy results in a high response rate and favourable survival times. Further study is needed to determine its prevalence in dogs with chronic enteropathies.

AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT The features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The disease is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis characterized by erosive, destructive changes within the joint. The latter can be identified on radiographs by loss of mineral, the presence of discrete erosions or an irregular joint margin. Increased periarticular soft tissue is common and periosteal new bone is not unusual. The most obvious clinical feature is generalized stiffness particularly after rest. Joints are often thickened and painful on manipulation. A third of cases present with pyrexia, lethargy and inappetence in addition to lameness. Synovial fluid evaluation shows an increased number of white cells, most of which are polymorphs; the mucin clot is poor. The ESR is generally increased and rheumatoid factor (an antiglobulin auto-antibody) is present in 73 per cent of cases. Treatment is often unrewarding, although many dogs can cope for considerable periods of time.

AB  - Abstract The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) is a multi-site naturalistic cohort study to: (1) describe the long-term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders, and (2) to integrate biological and psychosocial research paradigms within an epidemiological approach in order to examine (interaction between) predictors of the long-term course and consequences. Its design is an eight-year longitudinal cohort study among 2981 participants aged 18 through 65 years. The sample consists of 1701 persons with a current (six-month recency) diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder, 907 persons with life-time diagnoses or at risk because of a family history or subthreshold depressive or anxiety symptoms, and 373 healthy controls. Recruitment took place in the general population, in general practices (through a three-stage screening procedure), and in mental health organizations in order to recruit persons reflecting various settings and developmental stages of psychopathology. During a four-hour baseline assessment including written questionnaires, interviews, a medical examination, a cognitive computer task and collection of blood and saliva samples, extensive information was gathered about key (mental) health outcomes and demographic, psychosocial, clinical, biological and genetic determinants. Detailed assessments will be repeated after one, two, four and eight years of follow-up. The findings of NESDA are expected to provide more detailed insight into (predictors of) the long-term course of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. Besides its scientific relevance, this may contribute to more effective prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of ciclosporin in cats with allergic skin disease. Methods: Ten cats with signs of allergic skin disease were administered ciclosporin daily at a dose of 3·6 to 8·3 mg/kg for one month. None of these cats had previously responded to a hypoallergenic diet trial, and all animals had previously been treated with endectoparasiticidal drugs, with no improvement two weeks before entering the trial. On days 0 and 30, owners assessed pruritus with a visual analogue scale, and veterinarians evaluated cutaneous lesions. Results: All the cats had pruritus and erythema, five had alopecia, two had an eosinophilic plaque, one had miliary dermatitis and two had both alopecia and an eosinophilic plaque. Good or excellent improvement was observed in 40 per cent of cats for pruritus, 57 per cent of cats for alopecia and 60 per cent of cats for erythema. A significant decrease in mean scores was observed for pruritus only, while for erythema and alopecia, it was close to being significant (P<0·052). Clinical Significance: Ciclosporin may be helpful in symptomatically treating signs of feline allergic skin disease. However, it is important to remember that ciclosporin is not licensed for use in cats.

AB  - Abstract Fibrotic disorders are multistage progressive processes that often arise from different causes and are commonly associated with chronic inflammation. Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix is the hallmark of many fibrotic diseases. This may be due to an excess of fibroblast recruitment and activation, as well as to their differentiation in myofibroblasts. These events may be triggered by cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released by lymphocytes or macrophages. The excessive production of extracellular matrix is apparently due to alterations of metabolic pathways in activated fibroblasts. It has been suggested that a defective autophagy, an important subcellular pathway with multiple homeostatic roles, also recognized as a key component of both innate and acquired immunity, could play a role. In this review we illustrate recent insights in the field, suggesting the possible implication of the immune system in orchestrating the fibrotic response via the modulation of autophagic pathways.

AB  - At a workshop coordinated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer and Precancer in the UK issues related to terminology, definitions and classification of oral precancer were discussed by an expert group. The consensus views of the Working Group are presented here. The term, ?potentially malignant disorders?, was recommended to refer to precancer as it conveys that not all disorders described under this term may transform into cancer. Critically evaluating all definitions proposed so far for oral leukoplakia, the Working Group agreed that the term leukoplakia should be used to recognize ?white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer?. An outline was proposed for diagnosing oral leukoplakia that will prevent other oral white disorders being misclassified as leukoplakia. The Working Group discussed the caveats involved in the current use of terminology and classification of oral potentially malignant disorders, deficiencies of these complex systems, and how they have evolved over the past several decades. The terminology presented in this report reflects our best understanding of multi-step carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa, and aspires to engender consistency in use.

AB  - Background Anecdotal reports suggest a recent high prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in Irish wolfhounds, prompting further investigation into the incidence of the disease in this breed. Objectives To investigate the possibility that Irish wolfhounds have an increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and to consider possible predisposing causes in this breed. Methods Retrospective review of medical records from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Sydney, from January 2008 to December 2012 inclusive to determine the total hospital incidence and individual breed incidences of aspiration pneumonia. Results The total hospital incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 0?·?5%. The Irish wolfhound had the highest breed incidence, with 9 of 25 dogs (36%) diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Four of the Irish wolfhounds had a predisposing cause identified; one having a choking episode, one having gastric bloat, while two were diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis after it was specifically investigated because of clinical suspicion. Five had no underlying cause of their aspiration pneumonia determined. Clinical Significance On the basis of the hospital population studied, the Irish wolfhound has a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation into the possible predisposing cause(s) in this breed is warranted.

Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3?years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. Clinical Significance Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Development of inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII), the major complication of haemophilia A treatment today, is influenced by multiple factors. Genetic (F8 mutation, family history, ethnicity, polymorphisms in immune modulating genes) and non-genetic (intensive exposure to FVIII, presence of pro-inflammatory signals as might occur with large bleeds, infections, surgery, or other immune stimulants [e.g. vaccines]) risk factors as well as their complex inter-relationships contribute to the inhibitor risk profile of haemophilia patients, particularly in the previously untreated patient (PUP) population. Studies in PUPs have been fundamental to furthering the understanding of FVIII inhibitor development, as well as discovering previously unappreciated risk factors. The multi-factorial nature of inhibitor development makes it difficult to ascertain the contribution of FVIII products in inhibitor development through individual PUP studies. Sufficiently powered studies of large cohorts may overcome these limitations but interpretations should be conducted cautiously. Proper design and implementation of PUP safety studies will become even more important with the introduction of new molecules, such as extended half-life or human cell-line derived FVIII that propose reduced immunogenicity. Despite these difficulties, carefully performed clinical studies in PUPs may provide important insights into the natural history of the immune response to FVIII and may suggest targets for intervention to reduce immunogenicity.

AB  - Summary Dysfunction of T cells is a common feature in chronic persistent viral infections, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), and although hepatic and peripheral T cells have been studied extensively in chronic HCV hepatitis, the role of splenic T cell responses in such patients is poorly defined. This is an important issue, as thrombocytopenia is a complication of HCV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), due to splenic platelet sequestration and bone marrow suppression; splenectomy has been proposed to treat such patients. Herein, we studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenic lymphoid subpopulations from a total of 22 patients, including 15 with HCV-related LC with marked thrombocytopenia treated with splenectomy, and seven controls. CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and spleen were isolated and phenotype and function evaluated. Splenic CD4+ T cells in patients with LC expressed molecules associated with inhibitory signalling, including increased frequency of negative markers such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) and decreased production of cytokines. Patients with LC manifest higher levels of splenic CD4+ regulatory T cells and PD-L1- and PD-L2-expressing cells than controls. Blocking of PD-1/PD-1 ligand interaction reconstituted proliferative and cytokine responses of splenic mononuclear cells (SMC) from patients with LC. Splenectomy was followed by an increase in the ratio of interferon (IFN)-? to interleukin (IL)-10 and a reduction of PD-1-expressing CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. Our data suggest that peripheral tolerance is promoted by the spleen in LC via the up-regulated expression of PD-1 ligands.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating and often progressive condition leading to exercise intolerance and frequently the demise of the animal. Although uncommonly encountered in horses, the condition is intensely researched both in human medicine and animal models. Viral infections have long been suspected to play a part in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions in other species. In 2007, an association between equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection and nodular pulmonary fibrosis in horses was suggested and the name equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) was introduced. Recently, the presence of EHV-5 in equine lymphoma has also emerged. The case report by Schwarz et?al. in this issue describes a horse suffering from concurrent T cell leukaemia and EMPF in association with EHV-5. This article summarises current knowledge about EMPF and EHV-5 infections in horses, recent developments in the understanding of pulmonary fibrosis in man and the proposed contribution of viral infections to pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions.

AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - This is the second annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 200 new references. Since the literature pertinent to geriatrics is growing ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Almost all of the references date from the past four years. Preference is given to recent publications, since they provide a list of the important earlier articles. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional review article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, studies of which, it will be noted, are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. A few articles concern diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study specifically from a geriatric viewpoint exists; e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, and the fourth (IV) with non-physician services available to the elderly, including ethical quandaries. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Inconsistencies and inadequacies in both the approach to post-mortem examination of the heart and the subsequent reporting of findings have been blamed for a lack of progression of understanding about great ape cardiovascular disease. In order to minimize and confront these issues in the United States, Association of Zoos and Aquariums-member zoos have necropsy data collated by the Great Ape Heart Project using a protocol developed by their pathology advisors. In Europe, however, there does not appear to be in existence any standardization or process for consistent cardiac post-mortem examination, data collection and/or relevant research. This article provides those readers working within/for European collections with a suggested protocol for the initial post-mortem inspection and sampling of the hearts of great apes. This article also outlines the detailed macroscopic and histopathologic examination that is currently carried out at The University of Nottingham, UK, as part of an ongoing prospective, multi-centre study into great ape cardiovascular disease aetiopathogenesis. Finally, readers are offered guidance on the reporting and description specifically of idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (also referred to elsewhere as fibrosing cardiomyopathy). The standardized post-mortem examination of the great ape heart across European zoological collections will ensure a more uniform sampling procedure resulting in the availability of consistent good-quality data. It is hoped that this will, in turn, inform diagnostic pathology and research in this area, and enhance understanding about the aetiopathogenesis of great ape cardiovascular lesions.
