AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted to heart transplant recipients by donor organs. Mid-term results were reported using HCV-positive donors in patients at risk of imminent death (group I, n?=?10), or in patients who otherwise would not have been offered heart transplantation (group II, n?=?10) because of age (9/10) or associated medical risk (1/10). Medical records pertaining to patients receiving HCV-positive allografts between July 1994 and December 1999 were reviewed. The recipients consisted of 19 males and one female, with a median age of 54?years for group I and 66 for group II. The HCV RNA level, seroconversion of anti-HCV antibody, biochemical liver dysfunction, and causes of death were examined. Older recipients received reduced immunosuppression. Two patients in group II were HCV positive and were also retransplants. The hospital mortality rate was 10% in group I and 20% in group II; both hepatitis C-positive recipients died postoperatively prior to discharge. All predischarge deaths were related to multi-system organ failure (MSOF). All 17 survivors were HCV negative prior to transplant. Of these, 4/17 seroconverted. HCV RNA was detected in two of them. At a median follow-up of 26.4?months, 2/11 current survivors continue to test anti-HCV positive and are RNA negative. Three-year actual survival was 40% for group I and 70% in group II. Transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) accounted for one postoperative death in group I. Current data show that four out of 11 survivors had developed TCAD at 3-year follow-up, yielding an actual freedom from TCAD rate of 12/17 (70%) at 3-year follow-up. Hepatitis C transmission using a donor heart as the reservoir is moderate (25%). Limited use of such donors is justified in selected patients. The risk for hepatic disease may be reduced by tailoring immunosuppression specifically for such recipients, particularly if they are at low risk of rejection. Further studies are necessary to define a possible association between HCV and TCAD.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.

AB  - Summary Background Equine herpesvirus-associated myeloencephalopathy is the result of endothelial cell infection of the spinal cord vasculature with equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) during cell-associated viraemia. Endothelial cell infection requires contact between infected peripheral blood mononuclear and endothelial cells. Inflammation generated during viraemia likely upregulates adhesion molecule expression on both cell types increasing contact and facilitating endothelial cell infection. Objectives Evaluating the role of anti-inflammatory drugs in decreasing endothelial cell infection with EHV-1. Study design In vitro assay, crossover design, multiple drug testing. Methods In vitro modified infectious centre assay using immortalised carotid artery endothelial cells or primary brain endothelial cells with plaque counts per well as outcome. Cells were either anti-inflammatory drug treated or left untreated. Results Significant reduction of plaque count when cells were treated compared with untreated cells. No dose-dependent effect when drug concentrations were increased to 10? dose. Treatment of both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and endothelial cells (EC) is required for significant plaque count reduction. Main limitations In vitro study. Conclusions Anti-inflammatory drugs decrease infection of endothelial cells likely by reducing contact between EHV-1 infected PBMC and endothelial cells in vitro. The role of adhesion molecules in this process needs further investigation. In vitro results suggest anti-inflammatory drug therapy during EHV-1 infection and viraemia in horses could be clinically relevant.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was an objective in vivo assessment of skin properties after reconstruction with two artificial dermal substitutes, Integra? and Hyalomatrix?. Twenty-seven patients underwent reconstruction of 36 skin-loss sites with full-thickness skin graft, split-thickness skin graft, Hyalomatrix? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft and Integra? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft. Objective assessments were carried out using three instrumental devices: Multi Probe Adapter System MPA; 22?MHz ultrasound skin scan; and Primos Pico for a three-dimensional (3D) skin scan. The skin parameters under study in our sample were: corneometry, transepidermal water loss, elastometry, colorimetry, skin thickness and 3D skin surface pattern. A skin reconstruction with Hyalomatrix seemed to most closely approach the hydration, transepidermal water loss and skin surface 3D pattern of normal skin. A skin reconstruction with Integra seemed to demonstrate the best skin colour feature and elastic properties. Although no statistically significant differences were observed, the descriptive analysis of the outcomes might suggest a better cell regulation, regenerated extracellular matrix and neoangiogenesis with the use of Hyalomatrix, and the formation of a more elastic regenerated dermis, with overall better physical, mechanical and optical properties, with the use of Integra. ? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Although both heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy have enjoyed clinical success in the treatment of patients with end-stage heart disease, newer left ventricular assist devices currently undergoing testing are likely to have a tremendous impact on the management of these patients. Smaller, more durable devices with improved safety profiles will allow for longer duration of therapy and make biventricular support more feasible, obviating the need for the total artificial heart. In this article we review the historical aspects of both forms of therapy and highlight the current use of left ventricular assist device therapy on patients awaiting heart transplantation.

AB  - Two littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University?s Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period. Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - An intrathoracic mass was discovered as an incidental finding in a 14-year-old, spayed, female Rottweiler cross during evaluation of urinary incontinence. Computed tomography suggested a pericardial or pleural location and high adipose content of the mass. The mass was removed via lateral thoracotomy with partial pericardectomy and was diagnosed as a pericardial lipoma. The dog recovered well, and there was no evidence of recurrence approximately one year later. Adipose tumours of the heart and its associated structures are rare in dogs and have been associated with both successful and fatal outcomes.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Accumulations of mucus within the trachea are often found during endoscopic examinations of the airways of poorly performing racehorses, but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of tracheal mucus, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) and cytological indices of tracheal aspirate on racing performance in Thoroughbred horses assessed by race place and whether the horse was raced. Methods: Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea was performed, and a tracheal aspirate obtained monthly at Thistledown racetrack from April to December, 2002 and 2003. Horses received a score of 0?4 for the degree of PLH and 0?4 for the amount of mucus visible in the trachea. The tracheal aspirate was assessed for turbidity, and total and differential cell counts. Generalised estimating equations models were used as repeated measures models for each risk factor and the level of association assessed through the risk factor's P value in the model. Results: Moderate to severe tracheal mucus (2?4) was a risk factor for poor racing performance. There was no association between degree of PLH, cell counts or turbidity of tracheal wash fluid and racing performance. However, horses that raced had higher total neutrophil counts in tracheal wash aspirates than horses that did not race. Conclusions: Grades 2?4 tracheal mucus should be considered a potential cause of poor racing performance in Thoroughbred horses. Clinical relevance: Because moderate to severe tracheal mucus accumulation, and not increased tracheal neutrophils, was a risk factor for poor racing performance, functionally significant airway inflammation may best be confirmed by the presence of mucus rather than increased number of neutrophils in the trachea.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The aim of this article was to describe our experience in the field of preoperative ear, nose and throat (ENT) assessment in each candidate for (maxillary) sinus floor elevation (SFE) after the introduction of a systematic protocol. The protocol evaluates the sinus compliance by means of ENT preliminary examination with nasal fiberoptic endoscopy to identify all of the situations that may predispose to post-lifting complications, i.e. potentially irreversible (PIECs) and presumably reversible (PRECs) ENT contraindications to SFE, and to evaluate its impact on SFE success. Material and methods Patient candidates for SFE were carefully assessed by means of case-history collection, complete ENT evaluation with nasal fiberoptic endoscopy and imaging to detect PIECs, PRECs, or no ENT contraindications for SFE. In case of PRECs, SFE was postponed until complete clinical recovery. Impact of preoperative ENT assessment on SFE outcome was assessed by means of post-lifting telephonic interview and ENT evaluation. Results PRECs were detected and resolved before SFE was performed in 38.2% of our 34 patients; no intra- or post-lifting complications occurred in the patients with no ENT contraindications or PRECs. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that a careful multi-tasking preoperative management, including an ENT assessment with fiberoptic endoscopy and a radiological evaluation extended to the ostio-meatal complex, is very useful in candidates for SFE.

AB  - Gangliosides (Gs) have been implicated as potential antigens in autoimmune neuropathies and anti-tumoral immune response, but their role in paraneoplastic neuropathy has been poorly investigated. We describe one patient affected by lung adenocarcinoma and subacute motor axonal neuropathy with high titres of IgG1 and IgG3 to several Gs. Expansion (3% of total T cells) of peripheral g/d T lymphocytes was found, as compared to healthy controls (<0.5%) and to patients with lung neoplasia without neuropathy (1.1%). At three months after neoplasia removal, we observed stabilization of the neuropathy, decline of anti-Gs IgG and of g/d T cells, which dropped to normal values. Expression of GM1, GD1a, GM2 and GM3 was found by immunohistochemistry on patient's neoplastic cells, but not in control lung neoplasia. Absorption experiments of anti-Gs IgG revealed that only GD1a and GM1, among all Gs tested, significantly decreased anti-Gs IgG reactivity. Indirect immunohistochemistry with biotinylated IgG purified from the patient showed positive signals on motoneurons, dorsal root ganglia, axonal structures and Schwann cells and his own neoplastic cells. At autopsy, IgG deposits were found on the same neural targets. Purified IgG from the patient exerted high levels of cytotoxicity on both Schwann and neuroblastoma cells, as compared to healthy controls. The association of neoplasia, peripheral neuropathy and autoimmune responses to Gs observed in our patient proposes a pathogenetic role for Gs as putative autoantigens in paraneoplastic neuropathy.

AB  - A 12-month-old beagle presented for anorexia, pyrexia and vomiting. The dog had been treated intermittently with antibiotics and corticosteroids for inappetence and lethargy since five months of age. Previous laboratory abnormalities included macrocytosis and neutropenia. At presentation, the dog was lethargic, febrile and thin. Laboratory examination findings included anaemia, a left shift, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Multiple, small, hypoechoic, round hepatic lesions were observed on abdominal ultrasound. Cytological examination of hepatic fine needle aspirates revealed a fungal infection and associated pyogranulomatous inflammation. The dog's general condition deteriorated despite supportive measures and treatment with fluconazole, and owners opted for euthanasia before hypocobalaminaemia was identified. Subsequent genomic analysis revealed a CUBN:c.786delC mutation in a homozygous state, confirming hereditary cobalamin malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Similar to human infants, dogs with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome may rarely be presented for infectious diseases, distracting focus from the underlying primary disorder.

In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.

AB  - Objectives To assess the prevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in a population of dogs with a diagnosis of suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis. Materials and Methods Medical records of three referral centres were reviewed from 2008 to 2016 to identify a cohort of dogs diagnosed and treated for suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis after testing for evidence of exposure to these pathogens. Results In our sample of 400 dogs the prevalence for exposure (IgG>1:50) to Toxoplasma gondii was 8/201 (3∙98%). Active infection (IgG titre >1:400 or/and an IgM titre >1:64 and/or positive PCR in CSF) was suspected in 1/400 (0∙25%). The prevalence for exposure [Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titre >1:50] and active infection (IFA titres ≥?1:400 and/or positive PCR in CSF) with Neospora caninum were 14/201 (6∙96%) and 9/400 (2∙25%), respectively. Clinical Significance In view of the low prevalence of protozoan infections, the risk associated with starting immunosuppressive medication in dogs with evidence of inflammatory meningitis or encephalitis in the UK appears low.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex remains a significant cause of calf morbidity and mortality in both dairy and beef production in the UK. The respiratory tract offers a vulnerable interphase between the animal and the viruses and commensal bacteria involved in the complex. The defence systems of the respiratory tract are described and the main factors that impair these are explained, allowing a systematic farm specific approach to the management and prevention of BRD to be developed. The article is further informed by the experience and views of four bovine practitioners.
