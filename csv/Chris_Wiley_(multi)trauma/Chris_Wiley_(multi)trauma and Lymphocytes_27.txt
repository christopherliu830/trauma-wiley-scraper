AB  - Abstract Introduction This study reports the incidence, anatomic location, and outcomes of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) at a single active intestine transplant center. Methods Records were reviewed for all patients receiving an intestine transplant from 2003 to 2015. Pathology reports and pharmacy records were reviewed to establish the diagnosis, location, and therapeutic interventions for GVHD. Results A total of 236 intestine transplants were performed during the study period, with 37 patients (16%) developing GVHD. The median time to onset of disease was 83 days, with 89% of affected patients diagnosed in the first year post-transplant. Mortality for affected patients was 54% in the 1 year after GVHD diagnosis. Skin lesions were the most common manifestation of GVHD. Other sites of disease included lungs, bone marrow, oral mucosa, large intestine, and brain. The incidence of GVHD was 16% in adult patients, and slightly lower in pediatric recipients (13%). In adults, increasing graft volume (isolated vs multi-organ) and liver inclusion were associated with increasing risk of GVHD, though this was not seen in pediatric patients. Conclusion Overall, 16% of intestine transplant recipients developed GVHD. GVHD is associated with high mortality, and disease in the lungs, brain, and bone marrow was universally fatal.

AB  - This series describes five dogs with nasal polyps diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. Clinical signs included reverse sneezing, nasal discharge, epistaxsis, and stertor when breathing. Computerised tomographic findings included soft tissue mass, turbinate destruction, extension through the bony nasal septum and partial lysis of bones surrounding the nasal cavity. Three dogs were treated by dorsal rhinotomy, one dog was treated by ventral rhinotomy, and in one dog the polyp tissue was removed during nasal flushing. Three dogs have no clinical signs of nasal disease. One dog had confirmed recurrence of nasal polyps and was successfully treated with megavoltage radiation. One dog had recurrent nasal disease eight months after dorsal rhinotomy. Nasal polyps are a possible cause of nasal disease in dogs with nasal discharge, epistaxsis and stertor, and a differential diagnosis for dogs with extensive soft tissue lesions of the nasal cavities on computerised tomography. Nasal polyps can be treated successfully by rhinotomy in some cases but may reoccur.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrastructure, and autopsy findings are reported for four Greyhounds with a myeloproliferative disorder. In all dogs abnormalities were found in the granulocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, resulting in granulocytic leukaemia, impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryocytic dysplasia. The presence in blood of many small platelet producing cells (micromegakaryocytes) led to initial diagnostic confusion in three dogs with two of them suspected of having lymphatic leukaemia. An approach to the diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, including the awareness of other clinical possibilities, is presented. The significance of the presence of micromegakaryocytes in the peripheral blood stream is discussed with reference to other veterinary reports and similar findings in man.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - This study examined cellular and vascular changes in gingival connective tissue samples by stereologic point-counting procedures and interactive digital analyzing systems in long-term insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. Gingival connective tissue capillaries representing a clinically healthy sulcus with no evidence of periodontal disease at the site of biopsy were studied in 29 patients with diabetes. Based upon their long-term medical records, 19 were identified as having poorly controlled (PIDD) and 10 as controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (CIDD). Ten nondiabetic, age- and gender-matched individuals served as controls. Thirty-nine biopsies were processed for light microscopy, and the blood vessel area was analyzed using an interactive digital analyzing system; 9 gingival biopsies, 5 diabetic and 4 controls, were processed for morphometric electron microscopic analysis. For each individual, site-specific recordings were made for the plaque index, bleeding index, probing depth, loss of attachment, and radiographic loss of interproximal alveolar bone. No evident signs of periodontitis occurred at the biopsy sites. For each PIDD patient, respective volumetric and numeric densities of cellular components including fibroblasts, neutrophilic granulocytes, monocyte/macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, blast cells, and plasma cells were recorded in the inflamed connective tissue (ICT). Non-cellular components such as collagen fibers and blood vessels were also recorded. PIDD patients had elevated plasma cell levels relative to controls and they appeared also to have a decreased collagen fiber density. In addition, fibroblasts occupied less volume in the ICT of PIDD patients than in controls. PIDD patients had the largest mean area of cross-section of the blood vessels, but this difference was not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.211; f-test). No specific characteristics of ICT or vascular changes were detectable in adult well-controlled long-term diabetics under similar plaque conditions. Swollen and proliferated endothelial cells were frequently found in PIDD patients and the mean distance from the lumen to the outer border of basement membrane was greater in the PIDD than in the controls (P < 0.001; t-test). Overall, our findings that cellular, vascular, and connective tissue changes indicative of increased catabolism rather than anabolism detected in gingiva are especially associated with poorly controlled long-term insulin-dependent diabetes.

AB  - Abstract To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key cytokine and innate immunity genes influence risk for childhood lymphomas, we genotyped 37 children with Hodgkin?s (HL) and 48 with non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma (NHL), aged (1?month?14?yr), along with their 85 age- and gender-matched controls suffering from mild medical conditions. Genotypic analysis was performed for 10 SNPs from nine genes with important role in immunoregulatory pathways (IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL10, IL12, IL18, TNFα, IFN?, CD14). Analysis of SNPs genotypes revealed that the CD14 ?159 C>T polymorphism was associated with significantly increased risk for HL regarding both the CC and CT genotypes (ORCC: 5.36; 95% CI, 1.30?22.14; P?=?0.02, ORCT: 3.76; 95% CI, 1.00?14.16; P?=?0.05). An indicative association between IL18?137?G>C polymorphism with the CC genotype and NHL did not reach, however, statistical significance (ORCC, 3.78; 95% CI, 0.87?16.38; P?=?0.08). In conclusion, our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CD14?159 loci may be associated with childhood HL risk; these preliminary findings need to be further confirmed in sizeable multi-centre studies along with determination of cytokines, which could provide an insight on the biologic basis underlying these findings.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - The sequence of events involved in effector focus formation around challenge schistosomula in the lungs of mice vaccinated with radiation-attenuated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni has been characterized following intravenous administration of lung stage larvae. Histopathological analysis of the lungs of vaccinated animals revealed that infiltrating cells were present around larvae within 24?h. The main increment in cell recruitment occurred between 2 and 4 days, with foci reaching maximal diameter on day 8. No additional infiltration of the airways was detected by bronchoalveolar sampling before day 4 when the maximum number of cells, predominantly lymphocytes, was recovered. In contrast, responses in challenge control animals were relatively slight prior to day 12. IFN? was the major cytokine in airway cultures from vaccinated mice, the greatest increment in production coinciding with peak cell recruitment. A similar pattern of IFN? mRNA expression was observed in whole lung extracts, highlighting the dominance of Th1 responses in the effector mechanism. The slow start to focus formation may be due to the need for antigen, released by the intravascular parasite, to be translocated across the endothelium, processed by accessory cells and presented to the helper T cells which orchestrate the effector mechanism. The delay is of the same order as the period of development which the parasite must undergo in the lung, to facilitate further migration. This similarity in the timing may explain why some larvae are able to avoid the consequences of the pulmonary effector response.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MM) is a new generation immunosuppressant, which has been successfully used for treatment of renal, heart and liver transplants, and other immune-mediated diseases. MM is also a safe and steroid-sparing agent for treating neuromuscular diseases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myastenia gravis. MM is an ester of mycophenolic acid, an agent that inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Side effects are modest and there is a lower risk for late malignancies than other immunosuppressive drugs. We assessed MM in the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The therapy of MMN largely depends upon the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg induce and maintain improvement in MMN, but they do not eradicate the disease and are very expensive. No randomized controlled trials are available to indicate whether immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in MMN. We treated with MM four patients who fulfilled the clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN, aiming to assess whether the drug is safe and may help in reducing or discontinuing IVIg infusion in this disease. MM administration, at 1?g twice daily, was started when patients were still under IVIg treatment and showed minimal or no disability, as judged by the INCAT disability scale. At the third month of MM therapy, IVIg infusion was discontinued in 2 patients and reduced by 20 % in 2 patients. After a follow up ranging from 1 to 6 months, no worsening in the INCAT disability scale was observed in all the patients. One patient discontinued the medication after four months because of gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhea, weight loss and increased amylase/lipase levels. The promising response to MM and the lack of major side effects, warrant further multicentric controlled trials in MMN.

AB  - Periodontitis is a multi-factorial disease and in most cases also a disease with a chronic progression. Exposure to factors which contribute to periodontitis occurs over a long period, so that at the time of diagnosis it may be difficult to identify and evaluate what co-factors have contributed to its development. These include exposure to bacteria and viruses, inflammation, genetic factors, health behaviours and a variety of social factors, socio-economic status, behavioural and nutritional habits, the ability to cope with stress and the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Many patients in their 50s also experience other conditions such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or rheumatoid arthritis and recent reports on the associations and potential biological mechanisms by which periodontitis can be linked to other systemic diseases suggest that the patient with periodontitis is a challenged individual. Neither individuals nor their oral health care providers are currently prepared for the challenges in oral health care as the expectation of successful ageing with remaining and aesthetically functional teeth is increasing. The scientific evidence is, however, growing, and while the opportunities to prepare for successful ageing exist they must be included in the educational process of both current and future oral health care providers and their patients.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - Double layer dermal substitute (DS) consist of a 3-dimensional collagen structures and a superficial silicon layer that are positioned within the defect provide to promote tissue regeneration in skin wounds. DS often have unique physical characteristics due to differences in manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study is the clinical and histological comparison of Nevelia and Integra double layer DSs in patients with post-traumatic injury wounds. Thirty patients with post-traumatic wounds localised on the inferior limbs were randomised in 2 groups Nevelia or Integra, followed by autologous dermal epidermal graft (DEG). Clinical results were evaluated through the healing time; Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks and after 1 and 3 years. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation were performed at 0, 2, and 3 weeks. The difference in healing time between groups (P?=?.467, log-rank test), pain and self-estimation was not statistically significant after 35, 42, and 49 days and at 1-year follow up. Histological data showed evident healing of wound after 2 weeks compared with preoperative with both DSs. At 3 weeks reepithelialisation and dermal regeneration were evident with both substitutes; however Nevelia showed early regenerative properties in terms of epidermal proliferation and dermal renewal compared with Integra. Nevelia showed also a more evident angiogenesis vs Integra evaluated as α-SMA immunohistochemistry. Differences in the MSS score were statistically significant at 3 years follow up in favour of Nevelia group (P?=?.001). At long-term follow up, Nevelia showed a better clinical outcome measured as MSS score vs Integra measured as MSS. Histological and immunohistochemistry data showed that Nevelia allows faster neoangiogenesis and tissue regeneration with neoformed tissue architecture closer to the physiology of the skin.

AB  - Abstract This retrospective study aimed to describe and classify cats with intraocular lymphoma, determine the proportion of cases with presumed solitary ocular lymphoma (PSOL) compared with ocular manifestations of multicentric disease and assess the clinical outcomes of these patients. One hundred seventy-two cases identified through biopsy submissions were reviewed histologically; 163 of these cases were subtyped according to the WHO classification system. Cases were categorized as having PSOL or ocular lymphoma with suspected systemic involvement (SSI) based on submission forms and follow-up data. The majority of cases exhibited concurrent uveitis (75%) and secondary glaucoma (58%). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common subtype (n = 86; 53%), followed by peripheral T-cell lymphoma (n = 44; 27%). Other subtypes included anaplastic large T- (n = 8; 5%) and B-cell (n = 4; 2.5%) lymphomas, and 15 cases (9%) were negative for all immunohistochemical markers. In sixty-nine cases (40%), adequate clinical data and sufficient survival data were obtained to distinguish PSOL from SSI. PSOL comprised the majority of cases (64%), while 36% had SSI. When covarying for age at diagnosis, the median survival time was significantly higher (P = 0.003) for cases of PSOL (154 days) versus those with SSI (69 days); hazards ratio of 0.47 for PSOL (95% CI: 0.241-0.937). The subtype of lymphoma did not affect survival time. Cats with PSOL represent a greater proportion of the disease population, and this subset of cats with intraocular lymphoma has a better clinical outcome.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Neonatal encephalopathy is the most common neurological abnormality identified in neonatal foals, but its clinical course has been rarely characterised. Objectives To describe factors associated with nonsurvival in a population of foals diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional clinical study. Methods Cases were selected from equine neonatal (≤14 days of age) admissions between 1996 and 2007. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical parameters, laboratory variables and therapeutic interventions associated with nonsurvival. Results A total of 94 foals were included in the study. Median age at admission was 12 h (range 0?96 h). The most frequently identified clinical signs included abnormal udder seeking (59%), abnormal suckle (55%), inability to stand (42%), abnormal gastrointestinal motility (37%), abnormal consciousness (34%) and seizure activity (22%). Overall, 75 (79.8%) foals survived to be discharged from the hospital and 19 foals died or were subjected to euthanasia. Variables significantly associated with nonsurvival in the multivariable model were serum total calcium concentration, serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, recumbency, number of concurrent diseases, and use of vasopressors/inotropes. The model correctly classified 92.0% of cases. Conclusions Overall survival was good and similar to previous reports. Vasopressors/inotropes were the only therapeutic intervention associated with nonsurvival, suggesting that persistent hypotension is associated with nonsurvival in the current population. Foals with concurrent disease, high total calcium and low alkaline phosphatase at admission, and that were recumbent or required treatment with vasopressors/inotropes during hospitalisation, were significantly less likely to survive.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Joint inflammation and septic arthritis are both potential complications of intra-articular injections of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Clinicians may prophylactically co-inject BM-MSCs admixed with either antimicrobials or hyaluronic acid; however, the effect of these agents on cultured BM-MSCs is unknown. Objective To determine the effects of therapeutic levels of gentamicin, amikacin and hyaluronic acid on cultured equine BM-MSCs in vitro. Study design In vitro experimental study. Methods Equine BM-MSCs from 4 healthy mature horses were isolated. Cultured BM-MSCs from each donor were incubated with gentamicin (150?mg), amikacin (250?mg), hyaluronic acid (22?mg) or 1% penicillin/streptomycin (control) under sterile conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells viability, proliferation, mediator secretion and culture media pH were measured. Results Incubation of BM-MSCs with gentamicin resulted in >95% MSC death after 45?min, and incubation of BM-MSCs with amikacin resulted in >95% MSC death after 2?h. Incubation of BM-MSCs with hyaluronic acid or penicillin/streptomycin (control) for up to 6?h resulted in sustained BM-MSC viability of 80% and >93%, respectively. All additives resulted in decreased media pH in the first minute; however, the pH then remained constant over the 6 h incubation period. No significant differences in BM-MSC proliferation or mediator secretion between the penicillin/streptomycin (control) and cells treated with hyaluronic acid were observed. Conclusion Therapeutic concentrations of aminoglycoside antimicrobials are toxic to cultured equine BM-MSCs. The effects of hyaluronic acid on cultured MSC viability, proliferation and mediator secretion are minimal. Potential relevance Based on these findings, the mixing of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and cultured equine BM-MSCs prior to therapeutic use is not recommended.
