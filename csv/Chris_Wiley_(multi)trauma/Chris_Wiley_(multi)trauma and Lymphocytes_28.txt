AB  - Abstract Cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon gamma are associated with active pulmonary inflammation in sarcoidosis and they upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The objectives of this study were to examine iNOS upregulation in sarcoidosis by showing raised exhaled nitric oxide and increased iNOS activity in lung biopsy specimens of these patients utilizing immunohistochemistry. Exhaled NO was measured by a chemiluminescence analyser in 12 patients with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven sarcoidosis before and after 6 weeks of corticosteroid therapy. Lung biopsy specimens from these patients were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with a specific iNOS antibody. Exhaled NO was raised in newly diagnosed sarcoidosis (mean±sem): 9.8±0.4 versus 4.1±0.2 parts per billion (ppb) in 21 healthy controls, p<0.001; and fell significantly after 6 weeks treatment with corticosteroids to 5.9±1.4 ppb; p<0.01. There was no correlation between exhaled NO and other markers of disease activity. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated iNOS activity in respiratory epithelium and granulomas in patients with sarcoidosis. Exhaled nitric oxide is raised in patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis and may be a result of inducible nitric oxide synthase upregulation. The fall in exhaled nitric oxide following corticosteroid therapy may reflect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the respiratory epithelium and granulomas.

AB  - Abstract Acetylcholine signaling is essential for cognitive functioning and blocks inflammation. To maintain homeostasis, cholinergic signaling is subjected to multi-leveled and bidirectional regulation by both proteins and non-coding microRNAs (?CholinomiRs?). CholinomiRs coordinate the cognitive and inflammatory aspects of cholinergic signaling by targeting major cholinergic transcripts including the acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Notably, AChE inhibitors are the only currently approved line of treatment for Alzheimer's disease patients. Since cholinergic signaling blocks neuroinflammation which is inherent to Alzheimer's disease, genomic changes modifying AChE's properties and its susceptibility to inhibitors and/or to CholinomiRs regulation may affect the levels and properties of inflammasome components such as NLRP3. This calls for genomic-based medicine approaches based on genotyping of both coding and non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in cholinergic signaling. An example is a SNP in a recognition element for the primate-specific microRNA-608 within the 3? untranslated region of the AChE transcript. Carriers of the minor allele of that SNP present massively elevated brain AChE levels, increased trait anxiety and inflammation, accompanied by perturbed CholinomiR-608 regulatory networks and elevated prefrontal activity under exposure to stressful insults. Several additional SNPs in the AChE and other cholinergic genes await further studies, and might likewise involve different CholinomiRs and pathways including those modulating the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. CholinomiRs regulation of the cholinergic system thus merits in-depth interrogation and is likely to lead to personalized medicine approaches for achieving better homeostasis in health and disease. This is an article for the special issue XVth International Symposium on Cholinergic Mechanisms.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Abstract Severe traumatic injuries and infections are frequently accompanied by life-threatening shock and are associated with increases in the proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The body's first perception of injury is the nociceptive or pain response. This response is induced at the site of injury and is transmitted systemically by sensory neuropeptides, the tachykinins, released from sensory afferent c-fiber neurons. We studied the role of tachykinins in regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Destruction of terminal sensory nerve endings before lipopolysaccharide administration abrogates tachykinin synthesis and down-regulates TNF-α transcription and secretion. In contrast, the responses of interleukins-1 and -6 are unaffected. Pretreating animals with an antagonist for the substance P-specific NK-1 receptor also down-regulated the TNF-α response, whereas blockade of the NK-2 receptor had no effect. These findings indicate that substance P contributes to the induction of those cytokines that are involved in precipitating the shock response. J. Leukoc. Biol. 63: 602?605; 1998.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder mainly of children, whose pathogenesis is still unknown. Some studies have demonstrated that LCH lesions produce different cytokines abnormally that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in saliva from children with different clinical subtypes of LCH. We studied 29 children with LCH: seven unifocal (Group I), seven multifocal (Group II), 15 multisystemic (Group III) and 12 healthy volunteers (Group IV). Salivary IL-1? and PGE2 levels were significantly higher in LCH than in normal children. A multi-comparison test showed significantly (P?<?0.001) higher levels of both IL-1? and PGE2 in saliva from Group III compared with Groups II and I. A significant correlation (r?=?0.05) between IL-1? and PGE2 concentrations in saliva from each group was determined. Our findings demonstrated an association between high concentrations of salivary IL-1? and PGE2 and advanced stages of the disease. This allows us to suggest that the abnormal amount of these factors in saliva may serve as a risk marker for disease progression.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Transfusion is a corner stone treatment of sickle cell disease complications. However one of the serious complications of transfusions is represented by the delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) with a significant mortality. It is due to a massive intravascular haemolysis of both transfused and autologous red blood cells. It occurs between 5 to 20 days after a transfusion and is accompanied by a vaso-occlusive crisis and haemoglobinuria in almost all cases. The evolution can be life-threatening because of the appearance of a severe acute chest syndrome or a multi organ failure. About half patients are transferred in Intensive Care Unit. The biological diagnosis of DHTR is made by the rapid decline, or disappearance, of Hb A in sickle cell patients who were previously transfused. This event is associated with a significant increase of lactico-dehydrogenase (LDH) and worsening of anemia due to haemolysis. Allo antibodies are not found in 30%. DHTR is under diagnosed because of the delay between the transfusion and the symptoms, which mimic sickle cell vaso occlusive crises. This can lead to further transfusions that worsen the evolution and are ineffective. Because of the severity of this manifestation many treatment have been tried to improve the outcome as steroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab or eculizumab, without consensual guidelines. Early diagnosis of DHTR should help to decide the appropriate treatment, and avoid reiteration of transfusions. Transfusion indications should be maximally restricted in patients with previous post-transfusion haemolysis.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

AB  - Abstract Background Survival after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has improved because of advancements in allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT has been performed in Australia since the late 1970s. However, there are few published data about health problems of allo-HSCT survivors in Australia. Aims Identify health issues in long-term survivors of allo-HSCT in an Australian centre to manage better and prevent long-term complications. Methods The health records of all patients of allo-HSCT in a single centre from January 2000 to December 2007 and survived beyond 2 years were assessed. Results Ninety-nine of the 200 allo-HSCT patients survived beyond 2 years, and the median time from allo-HSCT was 74 months. Twenty-eight?per?cent died at a median of 37 months after allo-HSCT because of relapsed malignancy (12%), stroke (1%), infection (3%), chronic graft versus host disease (9%), secondary malignancy (2%) and unknown cause (1%). Ninety-one?per?cent reported one or more chronic health conditions. Health issues were chronic graft versus host disease (70%); respiratory (66%), ophthalmic (40%), bone (33%), and renal (26%) problems; and malignancies (14% skin, 3% solid organ). Seventy-nine?per?cent resumed vocation at full or reduced capacity 2 years after allo-HSCT. Clinicians identified 40% with quality of life (QOL) issues, but survivors? self-reported QOL was comparable with the general Australian population. Conclusion This study shows that allo-HSCT patients are living with high burdens of chronic diseases that warrant lifelong surveillance and engagement with healthcare. Structured, multi-disciplinary care as recommended by published guidelines for allo-HSCT survivors may reduce long-term effects and improve their outcomes.

AB  - Abstract. This case report of severe periodontitis concerns a young male patient with chronic idiopathic neutropenia seen between 1981 and 1983 by the School of Dental Medicine of Geneva and from 1984 to 1988 by the Eastman Dental Hospital of London. The patient was maintained by intermittent systemic antibiotics, subgingival chlorhexidine irrigation, conventional debridement, brushing, and wire-mesh and composite splinting of loose teeth. After leaving school, at the patient's express wish, the extreme downhill pattern of the periodontitis resulted in removal of affected teeth and overdenture construction. The extracted teeth and associated soft tissues were examined for relevant plaque and host response features. The intact morphotypes associated with the advancing front of the lesion were invariably Gram-negative or positive coccoid cells, or less commonly short rods, as in all documented forms of periodotitis. Connective tissue destruction was associated with a leucocyte accumulation comprising mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and plasma cells. Both were observed degenerated more deeply than in routine adult periodontitis, including PMN lysosome loss and lymphocyte maturation within peripheral blood vessels. Only in one instance, one part of the superficial connective tissue of one block contained bacteria. It was concluded that the features of plaque and the lesion suggest a typical first line of defence response as in other forms of periodontitis. From the consideration of the 10 years clinical history of the patient, it is clear that non-surgical management is possible even in extreme cases, without any compromise of the patient's oral or systemic health, and in accord with the patient's wishes.

This emerging disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, colic and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinaemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed upon abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L.?intracellularis in faeces. Although the clinical entity, diagnostic approach and treatment of EPE are well established and described, the epidemiology for this disease has remained largely unaddressed. This article focuses on new developments in the field of EPE, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting information.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.
