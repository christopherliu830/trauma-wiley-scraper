AB  - Abstract Background To examine the outcomes of the implementation of a multidisciplinary nutrition support team (NST) that included a pharmacist for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records and compared between the pre-NST group (n = 73) and post-NST group (n = 75). Patients were included if they received enteral or parenteral nutrition support for at least 72 hours in the ICU of an approximately 900-bed, top-tier university medical center. The percentage of goal kcal, the percentage of goal protein, serum albumin level, total lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, duration of mechanical ventilation use, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and mortality were evaluated. Results There were significant differences in the percentage of goal kcal (66.9% ± 25.9% vs 86.2% ± 27.5%; P < 0.001) and the percentage of goal protein (67.0% ± 29.9% vs 81.7% ± 30.7%; P < 0.05) between the pre-NST and post-NST groups. A higher percentage of goal kcal was associated with a significant decrease in the ICU LOS (P < 0.05) and hospital LOS (P < 0.05). The percentage of goal kcal was associated with mortality rate (odd ratio, 0.977; 95% confidential interval, 0.959?0.996; P = 0.016). Conclusion Implementation of a multidisciplinary NST service for critically ill patients was associated with higher percentages of goal kcal and goal protein, as well as a shortened duration of mechanical ventilation use. Higher energy supply was associated with a reduced mortality rate.

AB  - Leishmaniases are a globally widespread group of parasitic diseases from the group of anthropozoonoses. They are caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and dogs worldwide. In fact, the dog is considered one of the most important reservoir. The spleen is one of the several haematopoietic and immunocompetent organs involved. As this organ is a blood filter, the authors looked for the expression of this infection over the microvascular environment and modifications of the spleen cell population related to immunological responses to this parasitic condition. Tools:? Scanning electronic microscopy over intact tissue and corrosion casts, transmission electronic microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry (MAC 387 and CD3). Results:? Our results show three important modifications concerning the microvascular architecture of the spleen when compared to the normal pattern. A striking scarcity of the sinusoidal system sheath that surrounds the central arteries of the white pulp, a huge development of pulp venules and veins, differentiation of typical features of high endothelial venular cells. Remarks:? According to our results it seems that independent of the virulence of the parasite involved and the kind of immunity prevalent in a particular host, the spleen develops blood dynamic conditions that allows a sluggish blood flow so that cells involved in immunological processes can proliferate and differentiate and it also contributes to the trapping of lymphocytes to the area through the differentiation of typical characteristics of HEV endothelial cells.

AB  - Summary Diarrhoea is a common problem in the neonatal and suckling foal. In certain circumstances supplemental nutrition is necessary depending on the age of foal, severity of diarrhoea and presence of other systemic manifestations. Nutritional supplementation can be provided either enterally or parenterally. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition because it is the most natural and physiologically sound means to provide nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition may be warranted if the foal is unable to receive or tolerate enteral nutrition. Dextrose alone or with amino acids and lipids can provide appropriate nutrition when enteral feeding is not tolerated. As soon as the foal stabilises enteral feeding can be reintroduced.

AB  - Summary Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of several infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first-line immunosuppressive drugs used for controlling neuroinflammation. A delayed diffusion of GCs molecules and the high systemic doses required for brain-specific targeting lead to severe undesirable effects, particularly when lifelong treatment is required. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improving this current therapeutic approach. The intranasal (i.n.) route is being employed increasingly for drug delivery to the brain via the olfactory system. In this study, the i.n. route is compared to the intravenous (i.v.) administration of GCs with respect to their effectiveness in controlling neuroinflammation induced experimentally by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. A statistically significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the central nervous system (CNS) in the percentage of CD45+/CD11b+/lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D [Ly6G+ and in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining was observed in mice from the i.n.-dexamethasone (DX] group compared to control and i.v.-DX-treated animals. DX treatment did not modify the percentage of microglia and perivascular macrophages as determined by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunostaining of the cortex and hippocampus. The increased accumulation of DX in brain microvasculature in DX-i.n.-treated mice compared with controls and DX-IV-treated animals may underlie the higher effectiveness in controlling neuroinflammation. Altogether, these results indicate that IN-DX administration may offer a more efficient alternative than systemic administration to control neuroinflammation in different neuropathologies.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.

AB  - Objectives To describe the history, clinicopathological abnormalities, diagnostic imaging findings, lymph node cytological/histological appearance, treatment and outcome of English springer spaniels diagnosed with idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis. Materials and Methods In this retrospective UK-based multicentre study, 64 dogs were recruited from 10 referral centres, 32 first-opinion practices and three histopathology/cytology laboratories, between 2010 and 2016. Results The median age at presentation was 6 years (range: 0.17 to 11.75). Neutered females were frequently affected. Pyrexia (83.8%), peripheral lymphadenomegaly (78.4%), dermatological lesions (72.9%), lethargy (67.6%), hyporexia (54%), diarrhoea (29.7%), coughing (24.3%), epistaxis, sneezing or nasal discharge (21.6%), ocular signs (21.6%) and vomiting (16.2%) were reported in dogs for which the history and physical examination records were available. Popliteal (45.3%), superficial cervical (35.9%) and submandibular (37.5%) lymphadenomegaly were frequently reported. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed non-specific changes. When undertaken, testing for infectious diseases was negative in all cases. Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27%), pyogranulomatous (24%), neutrophilic (20%) or granulomatous (11%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38 dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15?weeks (range: 1 to 28?weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. Clinical Significance Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels. The characteristics of the disease, absence of identifiable infectious aetiology and response to glucocorticoid therapy suggest an immune-mediated aetiology.

AB  - Abstract Dermal substitutes offer alternative approaches for wounds of all thicknesses where sufficient donation sites are not available for self-grafts. Several dermal substitutes are described in literature. This study included 20 patients treated with a dermal induction template after the removal of malignant skin cancers situated in various parts of the body. The participants were especially aged patients with multiple skin cancers, and complex clinical conditions, often affected by pathologies such as cardiopathy, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia, and receiving pharmacological multi-therapies, particularly antiplatelets and anticoagulants. In many of these patients, the general complex clinical picture provided significant contraindication for complex reconstructive surgery because of the high risk involved. All patients achieved complete healing about 8?weeks after the first surgery. By using a dermal induction template, it was possible to cover substantial loss of substances without the need of autologous tissue, with smoother and less apparent scar, minor occurrence of hypertrophic and retracted scars, better flexibility of healed skin and therefore a better result from an aesthetic point of view.

AB  - Summary:? During the past several years, there has been increasing interest in the role of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) in epilepsy. Advances in neuroradiology have enhanced our ability to image and study the human cerebrovasculature, and further developments in the research of metabolic deficiencies linked to seizure disorders (e.g., GLUT1 deficiency), neuroinflammation, and multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have amplified the significance of the BBB's relationship to epilepsy. ?Prior to 1986, BBB research in epilepsy focused on three main areas: ultrastructural studies, brain glucose availability and transport, and clinical uses of AEDs. However, contrast-based imaging techniques and medical procedures such as BBB disruption provided a framework that demonstrated that the BBB could be reversibly disrupted by pathologic or iatrogenic manipulations, with important implications in terms of CNS drug delivery to ?multiple drug resistant? brain. This concept of BBB breakdown for therapeutic purposes has also unveiled a previously unrecognized role for BBB failure as a possible etiologic mechanism in epileptogenesis. Finally, a growing body of evidence has shown that inflammatory mechanisms may participate in the pathological changes observed in epileptic brain, with increasing awareness that blood-borne cells or signals may participate in epileptogenesis by virtue of a leaky BBB. In this article we will review the relationships between BBB function and epilepsy. In particular, we will illustrate consensus and divergence between clinical reality and animal studies.

AB  - The avian lung shows fundamental differences to its mammalian counterpart and is characterized by a larger surface area and a thinner gas-blood barrier. These features provide the morphological basis for the enhanced respiratory efficiency of the avian lung. However, they also predispose this organ to an increased risk of injury by pathogenic microorganisms. In order to investigate the host?pathogen interaction during pulmonary infection and vaccine delivery by aerosol immunization a detailed knowledge of the structure and ontogenesis of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is required. For this reason the BALT of chickens aged from 1?day to 6?months was studied by immunohistochemistry (ICC), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as by FACS analysis. During the first 2?weeks after hatching no organized lymphatic structures were found. At this time, the defence system was based on the presence of cells of the unspecific innate immune system. In the third week after hatching lymphoid follicles begin to develop at the branching of primary and secondary bronchi. These develop into a highly organized bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) characterized by high endothelial venules and a follicle associated epithelium (FAE) with ?M-cell-like? cells. However, pathogens that have successfully crossed this initial barrier are additionally confronted with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages distributed around the parabronchi. Our results imply that the BALT is the first and most important structure encountering antigen and microbial pathogens, thus playing a central role in the initiation of a specific immune response.

AB  - Summary In the mid-1950s, the need of mass cultivation techniques for vaccine production led to the development of large-scale cell culture bioreactors. The rapid growth in biopharmaceutical industry, with a surge of protein, antibody, and peptide drugs expected in the next 10-20 years, has been led by various products produced by mammalian cells. Mammalian cells can be grown as suspension cells or as anchorage-dependent cells. A deep understanding of cell metabolism is crucial for designing feeding strategies to improve productivity and decrease culture costs. The metabolic pathways of glutamine and glucose have been reported to be quite similar to all mammalian cells including stem cells. Static culture systems such as multi well-plates, T-flasks, or tissue culture Petri dishes are the most widely used options for expanding mammalian cells. Two case studies focusing mammalian cell culture for antibody production and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, in bioreactors systems, are presented.

AB  - Fish leukocyte heterogenity with respect to morphology, morphometry and immunological function has been object of some controversy, mostly because, in lower vertebrates, there are several interspecies differences. Leukocyte enzyme cytochemistry permits cellular differentiation, which is otherwise not possible with routine stains, and may also indicate cell function. In fish, phagocytic performance is principally operated by monocyte-macrophages (M?) present in tissues and in circulating blood. Fish thrombocytes (FTHR), even if they are the equivalent of platelets in mammals, are complete cells with cytoplasm and nucleus. They vary in shape from round, like small lymphocytes, to spindle-shaped or rod-shaped cells. Several cytochemical methods, as periodic acid Schiff (PAS), naphthol chloroacetate esterase (ASD), α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), peroxidase (PEROX), acid phosphatase (Ac. Phos.) with and without tartaric acid (ta) and alkaline phosphatase (Alk. Phos.) have been applied in Salmo gairdneri Richardson to investigate the expression of M? and FTHR enzyme patterns. Here, we compared cytochemistry between fish M? and FTHR, and between human M? and platelets/megakaryocytes, respectively, as indicated in the table. It appears that positivity to some enzyme cytochemistry is phylogenetically maintained in M?, while in FTHR the enzyme pattern has undergone modification during evolution. For instance, this is the case of ANAE, Ac. Phos. and Alk. Phos., which changed in the phylogenesis, while PAS, AS-D, PEROX are still present in the evolution.

AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Abstract Vitiligo is a complex disorder in which autoimmune destruction of melanocytes results in white patches of skin and overlying hair. Over the past several years, extensive genetic studies have outlined a biological framework of vitiligo pathobiology that underscores its relationship to other autoimmune diseases. This biological framework offers insight into both vitiligo pathogenesis and perhaps avenues towards more effective approaches to treatment and even disease prevention.

AB  - Summary Inflammatory conditions of the stomach are among the most common pathological entities of the gut. Helicobacter-associated gastritis is the most common single agent infection worldwide. In the west reactive gastropathy is becoming more common, usually due to drugs and/or alcohol. There are now considerable grounds for regarding reactive gastritis as a gastropathy because one characteristic of its pathology is a singular lack of an inflammatory cell infiltrate. There are other forms of reactive gastropathy, usually with prominent vascular components, such as portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Peptic ulceration is becoming less common in the west. One important factor is the decreasing prevalence of helicobacter infection, a major cause of peptic ulceration worldwide. As with gastritis, drugs are becoming the most important causative factor. However, peptic ulceration, as a whole, remains important, in both the stomach and the duodenum, not least because of the very considerable morbidity of its complications. Although less common than reactive gastropathy and Helicobacter-associated gastritis, there are other important forms of gastritis. Chronic atrophic gastritis is now accepted, principally, as a long-term consequence of helicobacter infection in the stomach. It is often difficult to diagnose on biopsy, but is an important predisposing factor to carcinoma and primary endocrine tumours of the stomach. Not surprisingly, given the highly acidic surroundings, infections other than with Helicobacter sp., which is especially adapted for life in the harsh environment of the stomach, are unusual but they do occur, especially viral gastritides. Lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous gastritis, collagenous gastritis and eosinophilic gastritis all provide interesting pathological problems and have important associations.
