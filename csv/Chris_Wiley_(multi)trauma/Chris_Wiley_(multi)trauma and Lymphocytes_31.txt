AB  - Natural hydrogels have been investigated for three-dimensional tissue reconstruction and regeneration given their ability to emulate the structural complexity of multi-component extracellular matrices (ECM). Hydrogels rich in ECM can be extracted and assembled from soft tissues, retain a composition specific to the tissue source, and stimulate vascularized tissue formation. However, poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation hinder their performance in regenerative applications. This study investigates the effect of glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking on the mechanical properties, biological activity, and degradation of dermis-isolated ECM-rich hydrogels. Compression tests indicated that hydrogel elastic moduli and yield stress values increased significantly with GA exposure time. Lyophilization was shown to decrease yield stress values with respect to non-lyophilized gels. Crosslinked ECM, unlike non-crosslinked gels, was resistant to pepsin degradation in vitro. In a rodent subcutaneous implant model, crosslinking for 0.5 hours or longer drastically slowed degradation relative to controls. Inflammation was low and mature vascularized granulation tissue was observed in all gels, with an increase in vessel density at 1 week in crosslinked gels relative to controls. These results support the potential use of dermis-derived hydrogels as materials for tissue engineering applications and suggest that crosslinking can enhance mechanical properties and prolong hydrogel lifetime while promoting vascularized tissue formation. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary It would seem like stating the obvious to draw the following conclusions. 1 ?The eyes are not isolated organs, but rather they are very much an integral part of the total body system physiologically and immunologically. The inherent 2-way connections are seen in the general circulatory system and the 4 exit routes of drugs from the eye ? the conjunctiva, the iris, the tear and aqueous drainage systems (Holden 1973). This is significant in the context of the multi-factor-etiology (genetic, infection, hapten, cross-sensitization, acquired metabolic disorders, and the environmental elements) for the general and ocular allergies. Primary and secondary ocular allergies are but a few of the many other indicators which point to the departure from good general health of the patient. 2 ?In the affluent and industrial societies one of the common economic-socio-medical aspects of life is typified by the circular connection of these phenomena: the massive supply of diverse range of drugs, the medication-conscious public that demands and consumes more and more drugs, which are ?sometimes? unwittingly prescribed (Pennington 1973). Therefore among the many exogenous allergens both ophthalmic and systemic medicines are likely to play an increasingly dominant role either in cross sensitization or in various forms of haptens. 3 ?More immunologic and clinical data should be published in optometry's literature, so that the profession may be better informed on the indications for referal. The external eye, especially the conjunctiva tissue, like any other mucous membrane, is a vulnerable site for contact dermatitis. 4 ?The future ? optometry as one of the paramedical groups involved in community health care, should not be just an independent isolated profession, but should also be involved in multiprofessional communication. The vision of team-approach to public health, with optometry playing its unique role, such as early detection of ocular and some systemic pathologies, has been convincingly presented by Smith (1971). If Smith's enlightened ideal of mainstream public health prevails, optometry has no need to adopt a defensive attitude about being a relatively young profession; and ? in theory ? I see no reason why the older health professions should be hypersensitive about co-operating and communicating with optometry in the interest of the people and the society.

AB  - Abstract: The splenic marginal zone of adult humans contains B cells, of which most express CD27, an antigen only recently identified as a marker for somatically mutated memory B cells. We investigated whether and to which extent the developing marginal zone in infants and children is populated by either memory (CD27+) or naive (CD27?) B cells. Frozen sections of 32 spleens of infants and children ranging in age from 6 days to 15 years and 6 adult spleens were investigated. The expression of CD27 in combination with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD21, IgM, IgD and ASM-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The marginal zone was already present at 4 months after birth but CD21 expression was observed first after 2 years. CD27-positive marginal zone B cells were observed firstly 2 years after birth and increased in number to adult levels at the age of 5 years. We demonstrated that the MZ of infants and young children is populated by naive B cells, which are replaced by memory B cells in a time frame of 2 to 5 years. Before the age of 2 years, although present, memory B cells appear to be unable to colonize the marginal zone. Because of the absence of memory B cells in the marginal zone, the immune system of a child is not capable to initiate a rapid secondary humoral immune response comparable to the adult immune response.

AB  - Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is an uncommon finding in the breast. Sixteen cases of xanthogranulomatous mastitis were reviewed to determine the characteristic clinicopathological features. Xanthogranulomatous mastitis involved foamy histiocyte clusters interspersed with inflammatory cells. Foamy histiocytes were bland with small pyknotic nuclei. Xanthogranulomatous mastitis was associated with fat necrosis in five cases (31%), multinucleated giant-cell reactions in six cases (38%), and cholesterol crystals in five cases (31%). In three cases (19%), xanthogranulomatous mastitis coincided with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma. Duct ectasia with foamy histiocyte aggregates were noted in five cases (31%). It is suggested that the etiology of xanthogranulomatous mastitis is obstruction and rupture of the ectatic duct with foamy histiocyte aggregates. In breast core biopsy, granular cell tumor and invasive carcinoma such as histiocytoid carcinoma and lipid-rich carcinoma could demonstrate similar pathological features to xanthogranulomatous mastitis. In conclusion, xanthogranulomatous mastitis could be encountered in breast core biopsy and surgical excision tissue. Diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous mastitis can be made by excluding other diseases that elicit xanthogranulomatous inflammation in the breast. In breast core biopsy, xanthogranulomatous mastitis could be distinguished from granular cell tumor, histiocytoid carcinoma and lipid-rich carcinoma by using cytokeratin and histiocytic marker such as α1-anti-trypsin and CD68 stain.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to analyze brain death interval and outcomes of pediatric cardiac transplantation using national registry data. Methods We retrospectively evaluated a pediatric cohort from the UNOS registry from 2005 to 2014. We restricted the donor cohort to those with a primary central nervous system event as the cause of hospitalization. Brain death interval (BDI) was defined as the time between hospital admission and organ procurement. Primary outcomes were recipient and graft survival time. Logistical regression modeling was used for multivariable analysis. Results The donor cohort included 2565 cases. Multivariable analysis demonstrated no relationship between BDI and recipient or graft survival time. For patient survival time, the lowest HR was 0.94 (0.63-1.39), P = 0.531; for graft survival time, the lowest HR was 0.89 (0.53-1.49), P = 0.563. We obtained similar results using a non-restricted donor cohort. Conclusions There was no clear relationship between BDI and recipient or graft survival after pediatric cardiac transplantation.

A planned hydrocelectomy was converted to a high orchiectomy because of bloody fluid, suggestive of paratesticular malignancy. The histopathology showed vaginalitis, which was finally diagnosed as immunoglobulin G4-related disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of immunoglobulin G4-related disease representing hydrocele testis.

AB  - Summary Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and telomere biology disorder characterized by dysplastic nails, reticular skin pigmentation and oral leucoplakia. Androgens are a standard therapeutic option for bone marrow failure in those patients with DC who are unable to undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but there are no systematic data on its use in those patients. We evaluated haematological response and side effects of androgen therapy in 16 patients with DC in our observational cohort study. Untreated DC patients served as controls. Seventy percent of treated DC patients had a haematological response with red blood cell and/or platelet transfusion independence. The expected age-related decline in telomere length was noted in androgen-treated patients. All treated DC patients had at least one significant lipid abnormality. Additional treatment-related findings included a significant decrease in thyroid binding globulin, accelerated growth in pre-pubertal children and splenic peliosis in two patients. Liver enzymes were elevated in both androgen-treated and untreated patients, suggesting underlying liver involvement in DC. This study suggests that androgen therapy can be effectively used to treat bone marrow failure in DC, but that side effects need to be closely monitored.

AB  - In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest the efficacy of various skin protection measures in the prevention of hand dermatitis (HD). The aims and objectives of this intervention study was to quantify the efficacy of skin protection (SP) measures and UVB hardening in the prevention of HD. SP measures were compared against UVB hardening in a controlled clinical trial of 94 apprentices. The apprentices were assigned to the intervention arms class-wise. Baker apprentices involved in a previous follow-up study served as an additional historic control group representing no intervention. The apprentices were interviewed and examined in a standardised way at the beginning of the vocational training and at four follow-ups. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured at the back of the hands. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the controls (C)(29.1%) followed by the UVB-group (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7%(95%CI ?8.5 to 28.1) and 15.8%(95%CI ?2.4 to 33.9), respectively. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed atopy (OR?=?4.74, 95%CI 1.12?20.11, p?=?0.035) and skin care (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16?0.86, p?=?0.023) to be independent risk factors. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95%CI 0.17?3.70) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.09?1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. The trends in the clinical results were confirmed by statistically significant differences in TEWL values. Apprentices in the SP group consistently had a lower prevalence of HD compared to the apprentices in the UVB and C group. These trends were reinforced by statistically significant differences in TEWL levels. A multi-centre trial is recommended to confirm the efficacy of SP measures in a larger randomised study.

AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. We report a case of temporal arteritis with a sympathetic component in the orofacial region, which responded to stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs). Case. An 81-year-old woman with limited mouth opening and pain upon chewing was referred to the Orofacial Pain Clinic at Nihon University Dental Hospital. The patient also presented with blurred vision and a burning sensation on the right side of her face. On clinical examination, the temporal artery was tender to palpation, and there was increased sensitivity in the temporal region bilaterally. The patient reported jaw pain and limited mouth opening. Laboratory examination showed elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The burning sensation was due to a sympathetic component, and SGBs substantially reduced both the burning sensation and right temporal pain. Blocking the sympathetic chain on the ipsilateral side also improved jaw movement. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist, after which she was admitted to hospital with a tentative diagnosis of temporal arteritis. Treatment with oral prednisone 30?mg daily was initiated, and the dose was tapered as her symptoms resolved. Discussion. The reason for the gradual pain relief after SGB is unclear, but we believe it was effective for ischemia in temporal arteritis because it led to dilation of affected arteries or suppression of inflammation/edema of the vascular wall. Conclusion. This case demonstrates that SGB may relieve pain related to temporal arteritis and sympathetically maintained headache and orofacial pain by reducing noxious stimulation peripherally and decreasing central pain transmission centrally.

AB  - Abstract In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory properties of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as microglia activation and inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that NBP improved the locomotor recovery of SD rats after SCI an significantly diminished the lesion cavity area of the spinal cord, apoptotic activity in neurons, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells at 7 days post-injury. NBP inhibited activation of microglia, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and reduced the upregulation of microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression at 1 day post-injury. In a co-culture system with BV-2 cells and PC12 cells, NBP significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of BV-2 cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. In addition, NBP reduced the activation of BV-2 cells, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibited microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression in BV-2 cells. Our findings demonstrate that NBP may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of SCI by inhibiting the activation of microglia via TLR4/NF-?B signalling.

AB  - The location, size and histological structure of the ovine paraepiglottic tonsils were determined in 20 sheep. Macroscopic examination of the pharyngeal tonsils was performed in 10 sheep of 9 months of age, of which the heads were fixed in acetic acid 2% for 24?h, and in non-fixed heads of five sheep aged between 6 and 9?months. The paraepiglottic tonsil is located lateral to the epiglottis in the ventromedial segment of the pharyngeal sidewall, i. e. at the floor of the piriform recess. The tonsil appears as a cluster of small nodular elevations, which are white after fixation in acetic acid and are called hereafter tonsillar nodules. The number of these nodules per tonsil ranged from 1 through 8. The length of the tonsil varied from 5 till 14?mm, and the width ranged from 2 till 5?mm. The tonsils of 5 sheep aged between 6 and 9?months and of five sheep aged between 9 and 12?months were excised and fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde. The blocks were processed routinely for histology and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (8??m thick) were stained with eosin and haematoxylin. Histology revealed that each tonsillar nodule consisted of several lymphoid follicles (noduli lymphatici) surrounded by parafollicular tissue. Most lymphoid follicles were secondary follicles consisting of a germinal centre, a dark zone and a mantle zone. Primary follicles devoid of germinal centres were most obvious at the periphery of the tonsillar nodules. The stratified squamous pharyngeal epithelium covering the lymphoid tissue was frequently infiltrated by numerous lymphocytes, forming a follicle-associated epithelium. Crypts were absent, but in some cases the pharyngeal epithelium was slightly infolded into the lymphoid tissue. The tonsillar nodules were almost completely encapsulated by dense connective tissue from which septa extended into the larger nodules. Acknowledgement:?

Access and take the CME test online and receive 1 hour of AMA PRA category 1 credit atCME.TheOncologist.com Increasingly, anemia is being recognized as a negative prognostic and predictive factor for patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatment modalities. The results of clinical studies have shown correlations between anemia and shorter survival times in patients with a wide variety of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including lung, ovarian, breast, and head/neck cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Also, anemia has been shown to predict treatment response in patients with ovarian, cervical, and urothelial cancers, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as refractory/relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia. Based on the presumed causal relationship between anemia and poor patient outcome, several studies have examined the influence of epoetin alfa (a recombinant human erythropoietin) on outcomes in anemic patients undergoing cancer treatment. The results of these studies have been encouraging, with indications of greater locoregional tumor control and higher response rates in epoetin alfa-treated patients. Additionally, epoetin alfa therapy, by correcting anemia, has been shown to improve a patient's energy level, ability to perform daily activities, and overall quality of life (QOL). Such effects not only enhance a patient's general well-being, but may also increase their tolerance of, and willingness to undergo, full courses of their cancer therapy in a timely manner. These findings support the use of epoetin alfa to achieve gains in QOL and cancer treatment outcomes in anemic cancer patients and suggest that additional studies be conducted to further investigate the potential benefits of this agent in regard to improved outcomes.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Essentially, all VCA recipients have experienced episodes of rejection. At the time this chapter was written, acute rejection episodes have been observed in up to 85% of VCA recipients within the first year. Due to the infrequent application of VCA, no single group has accumulated sufficient experience to determine histologic patterns of rejection. As such, this chapters focuses on the histopathological aspects of graft rejection within the context of the early stage of VCA development. We also provide a historic perspective of the study of VCA histopathology primed by the Banff Working Group, and considerations on non-alloimmune pathology.

AB  - The term baboon syndrome was introduced 20 years ago. It was proposed for a particular eruption mimicking the red gluteal area of the baboon after systemic exposure either to the contact allergens nickel and mercury or to oral ampicillin. Previously this phenomen was e.g. termed flexural exanthema to mercury. Since then similar incidences have been reported after systemic exposure to betalactam antibiotics and other drugs, sometimes under different terms. Clinically sharp demarcation of a V-shaped erythema is present in inguinal/genital and gluteal/perianal areas. Additionally papules, vesicles and hemorrhagic lesion may be found. In most patients presence of exanthema in other anatomical flexural regions (axilla, elbow, knee, ventral neck) has been identified. However, involvement of the plantar/palmar regions, face and mucosal sites has not been documented. Typically blood tests are normal and systemic symptoms are absent. Histological results vary but a predominance of superficial perivascular infiltrate with mononuclear cells has been reported. Occasional positive patch tests or stimulation of lymphocytes in the LTT may be suggestive for a type IV allergic reaction. Since the drug-related baboon syndrome shows clinically and histologically different findings to systemic contact dermatitis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), it should be seen as a separate entity. The mainstay for the diagnosis of systemic contact dermatitis requires contact sensitization and elicitation by a contact allergen. In contrast in the baboon syndrome and AGEP history for sensitization is often negative, although sometimes positive patch and LTT results can be found. AGEP, on the other hand, requires a distinct score including systemic signs and leucocytosis. In all three symptoms typically occur within 1 to 2 days. The term baboon syndrome does not reflect the whole range of symptoms and signs. And, although it is easily remembered, the comparison to an animal may be insulting. Therefore, we suggest that drug-induced baboon syndrome should be separated from the contact allergen-induced form, and should be recognized as a separate entity within the spectrum of drug eruptions. For this reason we propose the acronym SDRIFE (symmetrical drug related intertriginous flexural exanthema). This refers to the distinctive clinical pattern of this drug eruption without implicating any pathomechanism, which has not been clearly elucidated. The following criteria are proposed: 1) Exposure to a systemically administered drug, 2) Sharply demarcated erythema of the gluteal/perianal area and/or V-shaped erythema of the inguinal/perigenital area, 3) Involvement of at least one other intertriginous/flexural fold, 4) Bilaterally or symmetrically affected areas, and 5) Absence of systemic symptoms and signs.

AB  - Ramdial P K?(2010) Histopathology56, 39?56?Dermatopathological challenges in the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome era The histopathological assessment of cutaneous lesions is critical to the definitive diagnosis of many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated dermatoses, infections and tumours. Dermatopathological challenges stem mainly from the altered histopathological profile of established cutaneous entities compared with that in the HIV-unaffected population, the emergence of new diseases and the impact of therapeutic modalities on cutaneous lesions. This review focuses on some of these diagnostic dilemmas, with emphasis on the following challenges: (i) infective diagnostic pitfalls; (ii) itchy papular skin lesions; (iii) co-lesional comorbid diseases; (iv) drug-induced disease alterations; and (v) neoplastic and pseudoneoplastic proliferations. The drug-induced alterations include highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated disease modifications.

AB  - Minocycline is a second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been in therapeutic use for over 30 years because of its antibiotic properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is mainly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris and some sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, it has been reported that tetracyclines can exert a variety of biological actions that are independent of their anti-microbial activity, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. These findings specifically concern to minocycline as it has recently been found to have multiple non-antibiotic biological effects that are beneficial in experimental models of various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatitis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, minocycline has also emerged as the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotection. This effect has been confirmed in experimental models of ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain, and of several neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Moreover, other pre-clinical studies have shown its ability to inhibit malignant cell growth and activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus, and to prevent bone resorption. Considering the above-mentioned findings, this review will cover the most important topics in the pharmacology of minocycline to date, supporting its evaluation as a new therapeutic approach for many of the diseases described herein.
