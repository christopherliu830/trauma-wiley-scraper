AB  - Abstract Regulatory frameworks within the European Union demand that chemical substances are investigated for their ability to induce sensitization, an adverse health effect caused by the human immune system in response to chemical exposure. A recent ban on the use of animal tests within the cosmetics industry has led to an urgent need for alternative animal-free test methods that can be used for assessment of chemical sensitizers. To date, no such alternative assay has yet completed formal validation. However, a number of assays are in development and the understanding of the biological mechanisms of chemical sensitization has greatly increased during the last decade. In this MiniReview, we aim to summarize and give our view on the recent progress of method development for alternative assessment of chemical sensitizers. We propose that integrated testing strategies should comprise complementary assays, providing measurements of a wide range of mechanistic events, to perform well-educated risk assessments based on weight of evidence.

AB  - Glia cells are mediators as well as targets of the chronic inflammatory process in the central nervous system of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. They are involved in the control of autoimmunity, in the propagation and termination of the inflammatory reaction, in the induction of demyelination and neurodegeneration, and in remyelination and scaring. Demyelination, as well as neuronal and GLIA cell damage are induced by different immunological mechanisms including components of the adaptive and innate immune system. Oxidative injury resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction is one important mechanism of tissue injury. It is in part driven by the inflammatory response and the production of oxygen radicals mainly in microglia and macrophages. With increasing age of the patients and disease progression, oxidative injury is further amplified by additional mechanisms including central nervous system damage related microglia activation, progressive mitochondrial damage, and age-dependent iron accumulation within the human central nervous system. The inflammatory mechanisms associated with lesion formation in MS are to a large extent reflected in experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis. This is not the case for the amplification mechanisms of oxidative injury, which mainly operate in the progressive stage of the disease. GLIA 2014;62:1816?1830

AB  - Abstract Ring chromosome 21 syndrome is a rare condition with a well-characterized phenotype. Affected individuals have recognizable dysmorphic features, developmental delays, growth retardation, and a predisposition for congenital malformations involving the neurologic, craniofacial, digestive, genitourinary, skeletal, and hematologic systems. Structural cardiac anomalies have also been described, but dilated ascending aorta has not been previously reported in association with ring 21 (r(21)). Although rarely seen in this syndrome, the presence of ectopia lentis, abdominal herniae, and dilated ascending aorta suggest an underlying connective tissue disorder. A possible explanation is haploinsufficiency of the COL6A1, COL6A2, and/or COL18A genes located on the distal portion of chromosome 21q, which are lost when the ring chromosome is formed.

AB  - Abstract Repair of long ureteral defects often requires extensive surgical procedures and graft tissue, which is associated with various complications, for example, graft site morbidity or lack of suitable tissue. Tissue engineering might provide an alternative therapeutic approach in these cases. Reinforced tubular collagen-Vicryl scaffolds (l?=?5?cm, lumen ??=?6?mm, thickness?=?3?mm) were developed with or without vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, and evaluated in a pre-clinical porcine model. The reinforced scaffolds were successfully implanted in 20 pigs, and functional, macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was performed at 1 and 3?months. Two animals without scaffold implantation served as control. All animals survived until their predetermined evaluation time point, and grafted scaffolds showed urothelial regeneration, smooth muscle cell ingrowth and neovascularization. Loopogram and macroscopic evaluation revealed constriction of the scaffold lumen and hydroureteronephrosis. Enhanced muscle ingrowth was observed in growth factor-loaded scaffolds, but this was not significant. We conclude that reinforced collagen-Vicryl scaffolds are mechanically suitable for ureteral repair, but further optimization to prevent strictures is required.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To describe the clinical signs, management, histopathologic findings, and outcome of three dogs with a corneocentric presentation of nodular granulomatous episcleritis (NGE). Methods Three dogs of varying breeds were presented for a unilateral, nonpainful, and infiltrative corneal lesion in the dorsal aspect of the eye. Clinical response to symptomatic topical treatment directed at a presumed inflammatory or immune-mediated cause was poor. Due to this, and concerns of neoplasia, ultrasonography (n = 1), incisional biopsy (n = 2), and/or enucleation (n = 2) were performed. Results The inflammatory infiltrate observed on histopathology was identical to that seen in nodular granulomatous episcleritis in all three cases. However, atypically the inflammation was confined to the cornea and limbus, without episcleral or conjunctival involvement. Inflammation of the cornea was full thickness to Descemet's membrane. Following enucleation (n = 2), there were no postoperative complications, and no reported ophthalmic disease in the remaining eye. Currently, the single non-enucleated case remains controlled with systemic and topical immunosuppression. Conclusion To the best of the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an NGE condition purely affecting the full thickness of the cornea, without episcleral or conjunctival involvement. The authors propose this to represent an atypical corneocentric variant of NGE. This clinical presentation can resemble neoplasia; incisional biopsy is recommended for a definitive diagnosis. Further research into the optimal treatment strategies for this variant of NGE is required.

AB  - Abstract Aim Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare, fibrosing disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue. This study was undertaken to describe its clinical and laboratory features and identify prognostic factors associated with outcome. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all EF patients evaluated at our institution from 1 January1997 to 30 December 2016. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine treatment response rates over time. Potential associations between baseline characteristics and complete response were examined using Cox models adjusted for age and sex. Time-dependent covariates were used to examine treatment effects. Results We identified 89 EF patients, with a female-to-male ratio of 1:1. Clinical features included groove sign in 26 (29%), peau d'orange/dimpling in 22 (25%), inflammatory arthritis in 9 (10%) and muscle weakness in 9 (10%). Aldolase was elevated in 11/36 (31%). Complete response rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35-75) at 3 years. Diagnostic delay was inversely associated with treatment response (hazards ratio: 0.84 per 1 month increase; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). No baseline characteristics correlated with treatment response, but a trend toward positive association of elevated aldolase, hypergammaglobulinemia and presence of hematologic disorders was noted. Methotrexate was the most commonly used immunosuppressant in 79%, hydroxychloroquine in 45%, mycophenolate mofetil in 18% and azathioprine in 8%. No single immunosuppressant agent was associated with a superior response during treatment. Conclusions EF is characterized by relatively high response rates. Consensus diagnostic criteria, standardized management algorithms, and large prospective multi-center cohorts are needed to develop an evidence-directed approach to this challenging condition.

AB  - Summary Reduced HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been suggested as a predictive marker of immunosuppression following very high risk surgery, but there are few reports in lower risk surgery. In 32 patients undergoing low to intermediate risk surgery, blood samples were analysed by flow cytometry for HLA-DR expression and numbers in both CD14high and CD14lowCD16+ monocyte subsets. The numbers of CD14high monocytes increased at 24?h (mean (SD), 5.0 (2.2) vs 7.6 (3.9)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01) while CD14lowCD16+ monocytes decreased (0.68 (0.36) vs 0.44 (0.36)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01). HLA-DR expression was significantly reduced in both subsets by 24?h (mean (SD) fluorescent intensity 440 (310) vs 160 (130) for CD14high and 1000 (410) vs 560 (380) for CD14lowCD16+ subsets; p?<?0.01). This reduction of monocyte HLA-DR expression 24?h following lower risk surgery raises questions about the purported clinical utility of this biomarker as an early predictor of postoperative complications. Our results also suggest that surgery induces significant trafficking (i.e. mobilisation, margination and extravasation) of monocyte subsets, and that monocyte HLA-DR depression is the result of a down-regulatory phenomenon (decreased protein expression on each cell) rather than the differential trafficking of monocyte subsets.

AB  - Introduction Viscosupplementation can improve function in haemophilia patients. Viscosupplementation results can be improved by prior joint lavage and triamcinolone administration. Aim To objectively assess whether viscosupplementation and associated triamcinolone use in patients with severe haemophilic arthropathy following joint lavage improves force and balance and reduces bleeding events. Methods Fourteen patients with haemophilic knee arthritis with and without the involvement of other joints underwent joint lavage and subsequent injections of Hylan G-F20 and triamcinolone into all affected joints. Patients were evaluated with NeuroCom? force and balance platforms using the step-up-and-over task (STP), sit-to-stand test (STS), one-leg stance (UNI) and weight-bearing squat (WBS) at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Bleeding events in the year prior to and the year after the procedure were analysed. Results Sixteen knees, 15 ankles, eight elbows and one shoulder were treated. The STP results indicated improvements in the lift-up indices (right leg) at all time points evaluated (P = 0.03). The STS results revealed coupled improvement in weight transfer and the rising index for up to a year (P = 0.02). Balance (UNI) with eyes open or closed improved in all evaluations. The WBS results revealed improvements at all degrees of flexion (0, P = 0.003; 30°, P = 0.001; 60°, P < 0.001 and 90°, P < 0.001). The numbers of total and traumatic bleeding events were reduced (P = 0.04). Conclusion Joint lavage followed by injections of triamcinolone and Hylan G-F20 improved balance, function and bleeding events in severe haemophilic arthropathy patients.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Iron (Fe) is essential to almost all organisms, as required by cells to satisfy metabolic needs and accomplish specialized functions. Its ability to exchange electrons between different substrates, however, renders it potentially toxic. Fine tune-mechanisms are necessary to maintain Fe homeostasis and, as such, to prevent its participation into the Fenton reaction and generation of oxidative stress. These are particularly important in the context of inflammation/infection, where restricting Fe availability to invading pathogens is one, if not, the main host defense strategy against microbial growth. The ability of Fe to modulate several aspects of the immune response is associated with a number of ?costs? and ?benefits?, some of which have been described in this review. ? 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):442?450, 2017

AB  - During a 2 year period, 229 non-intensive care patients received total parenteral nutrition (tpn) for a mean of 23.2 days. Nutritional parameters of weight, triceps skin-fold thickness (tsf), mid-arm muscle circumference (mamc), total lymphocyte count (tlc), serum albumin and serum transferrin were measured prior to commencement of tpn and then at weekly intervals. All parameters showed an upward trend during the period of tpn. This was small and not statistically significant for weight, tsf, mamc and albumin; the trends were greater and statistically significant for transferrin (p= 0.001) and tlc (p= 0.002). In contrast, in the 14.4% of patients who died, albumin, transferrin and tlc all fell. Patients who died had a significantly lower initial albumin (p= 0.05), transferrin (p= 0.04) and tlc (p= 0.04). The last values obtained in patients who died were very significantly lower for albumin (p < 0.001), transferrin (p < 0.001) and tlc (p= 0.003). Single-lumen tunnelled subclavian catheters had a significantly lower incidence of catheter sepsis (4.8%) compared with double-lumen (17.4%) and triple-lumen (13.7%) catheters (p= 0.01). There was also a greater incidence of mechanical and thrombotic complications with multiple-lumen catheters compared with single-lumen catheters (p= 0.02). This study shows that the nutritional indices albumin, transferrin and tlc have prognostic significance. Single-lumen rather than multiple-lumen catheters should be used for administration of tpn whenever possible.

Aetiologies include: lymphadenopathy due to inflammation, malignancy and degenerative causes; soft tissue tumours such as haemangioma, lymphangioma, peripheral nerve sheath tumours and lipomas; post-surgical complications such as seroma, lymphocoele and haematoma; lesions arising in accessory breast tissue such as fibroadenoma and carcinoma. Some of these entities have distinctive imaging appearances knowledge of which can be helpful in suggesting the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Cetaceans, occupying the top levels in marine food chains, are vulnerable to elevated levels of potentially toxic trace elements, such as aluminium (Al), mercury (Hg) and nickel (Ni). Negative effects associated with these toxic metals include infection by opportunistic microbial invaders. To corroborate the link between the presence of cutaneous fungal invaders and trace element levels, skin samples from 40 stranded false killer whales (FKWs) were analysed using culture techniques and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. Twenty-two skin samples yielded 18 clinically relevant fungal species. While evidence for bioaccumulation of Hg in the skin of the FKWs was observed, a strong link was found to exist between the occurrence of opportunistic fungal invaders and higher Al?:?Se and Al?:?Zn ratios. This study provides indications that elevated levels of some toxic metals, such as Al, contribute to immunotoxicity rendering FKWs susceptible to colonization by cutaneous opportunistic fungal invaders.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in an immediate loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site and is associated with a poor prognosis. The inhibitory environment that develops in response to the injury is mainly due to local expression of inhibitory factors, scarring and the formation of cystic cavitations, all of which limit the regenerative capacity of endogenous or transplanted cells.Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective.Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Abstract Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPS; OMIM 259770) is an autosomal-recessive genetic disorder characterized by severe osteoporosis and visual disturbance from childhood. Biallelic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 gene (LRP5) have been frequently detected, while a subset of patients had only one or no detectable mutation. We report on the clinical and molecular findings of four unrelated Japanese patients with the syndrome. The four patients had typical skeletal and ocular phenotypes of OPS, namely severe juvenile osteoporosis and early-onset visual disturbance, with or without mental retardation. We undertook standard PCR-based sequencing for LRP5 and found four missense mutations (p.L145F, p.T244M, p.P382L, and p.T552M), one nonsense mutation (p.R1534X), and one splice site mutation (c.1584+1G>A) among four OPS patients. Although three patients had two heterozygous mutations, one had only one heterozygous splice site mutation. In this patient, RT-PCR from lymphocytic RNA demonstrated splice error resulting in 63-bp insertion between exons 7 and 8. Furthermore, the patient was found to have only mutated RT-PCR fragment, implying that a seemingly normal allele did not express LRP5 mRNA. We then conducted custom- designed oligonucleotide tiling microarray analyses targeted to a 600-kb genome region harboring LRP5 and discovered a 7.2-kb microdeletion encompassing exons 22 and 23 of LRP5. We found various types of LRP5 mutations, including an exon-level deletion that is undetectable by standard PCR-based mutation screening. Oligonucleotide tiling microarray seems to be a powerful tool in identifying cryptic structural mutations. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
