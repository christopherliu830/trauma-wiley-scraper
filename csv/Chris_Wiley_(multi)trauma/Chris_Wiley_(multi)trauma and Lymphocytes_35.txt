AB  - Abstract Cutaneous atrophic conditions are typically caused by changes in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, sometimes consisting of the loss of a single fiber type. Since a significant decrease of subepidermal tissue is necessary for these lesions to be macroscopically atrophic, many conditions may not be appreciated as atrophy in the clinical setting. Clinicians should be familiar with the common or classic disorders causing cutaneous atrophy; however, there are a few new or rarely described atrophic conditions which are more difficult to identify and may not be atrophic clinically. This paper serves to describe the salient clinical and histological features of these new or rare disorders.

AB  - Nodular fasciitis is a benign self-limited myofibroblastic neoplasm, which usually involves the upper extremities and trunk of young patients. These tumors have been shown to harbor a translocation involving the MYH9 and USP6 genes, leading to overexpression of the latter. We report seven cases of nodular fasciitis with cutaneous presentations. All cases involved the dermis, with six involving the superficial subcutis, and one auricular tumor extending into cartilage. All cases showed USP6 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization; in two of three cases, the characteristic MYH9-USP6 fusion was shown by RT-PCR. All patients underwent conservative resection. Nodular fasciitis is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that can occasionally present in superficial locations and is sometimes mistaken for a malignant process. Molecular testing can be useful to distinguish this entity from other cutaneous spindle cell tumors.

AB  - Lumbar disc protrusion is common. Its clinical manifestations and treatments are closely related to the pathological changes; however, the pathological classification of lumbar disc protrusion is controversial. This article introduces a new pathological classification comprising four types of lumbar disc protrusion according to intraoperative findings. The damage-herniation type is probably caused by injury and is characterized by soft herniation, the capsule can easily be cut and the broken disc tissue blocks overflow or is easily removed. The broken disc substances should be completely removed; satisfactory results can be achieved by minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. The degeneration-protrusion type is characterized by hard and tough protrusions and the pathological process by degeneration and proliferative reaction. The nerve should be decompressed and relaxed with minimally invasive removal of the posterior wall; the bulged or protruded disc often need not be excised. The posterior vertebral osteochondrosis with disc protrusion type is characterized by deformity of the posterior vertebral body, osteochondral nodules and intervertebral disc protrusion. The herniated and fragmented disc tissue should be removed with partially protruding osteochondral nodules. Intervertebral disc cyst is of uncertain pathogenesis and is characterized by a cyst that communicates with the disc. Resection of the cyst under microscopic or endoscopic control can achieve good results; and whether the affected disc needs to be simultaneously resected is controversial. The new pathological classification proposed here is will aid better understanding of pathological changes and pathogenesis of lumbar disc protrusion and provides a reference for diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary In 2008 and 2009 a large number of cases of haemorrhagic diathesis (HD) in neonatal calves were reported in different European countries. In Flanders, 84 cases of neonatal HD in 30 herds were reported in this period. The disease typically affects calves younger than 1?month old from different breed and gender. Prominent clinical signs are cutaneous bleeding, petechiae on all mucosae, melena and often high fever. Early in the disease, the mental state of the animals is uncompromised. The typical haematological finding is pancytopenia, with severe to complete thrombocytopenia being the cause of the increased susceptibility to bleeding. In seven of the affected herds blood samples of calves of the same age group as the clinical case were collected and on six of those farms at least one subclinical case could be identified. Necropsy findings were generalized petechiae, ecchymoses or haemorrhages and variable lymphadenopathy. Histopathology of haemorrhagic lesions revealed multifocal extravasation of red blood cells (haemorrhage) with preservation of tissue architecture and absence of other abnormalities. Total bone marrow aplasia and depletion of all lymphoid tissue was the most prominent finding on histology. Activated macrophages and haemophagocytosis were seen on bone marrow cytology from two live calves. Polymerase chain reaction for bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus was negative. Several attempts to isolate a viral agent were unsuccessful.

AB  - Abstract In tendon rupture repair, improvements such as higher primary repair strength, anti-adhesion and accelerated healing are needed. We developed a potential carrier system of an electrospun DegraPol? tube, which was tightly implanted around a transected and conventionally sutured rabbit Achilles tendon. Histomorphometric analysis of the tendon tissue 12?weeks postoperation showed that the tenocyte density, tenocyte morphology and number of inflammation zones were statistically equivalent, whether or not DegraPol tube was implanted; only the collagen fibres were slightly less parallelly orientated in the tube-treated case. Comparison of rabbits that were operated on both hind legs with ones that were operated on only one hind leg showed that there were significantly more inflammation zones in the two-leg cases compared to the one-leg cases, while the implantation of a DegraPol tube had no such adverse effects. These findings are a prerequisite for using DegraPol tube as a carrier system for growth factors, cytokines or stem cells in order to accelerate the healing process of tendon tissue.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Abstract Presymptomatic DNA-testing for Huntington's disease has made it possible to predict whether or not at-risk individuals are gene-carriers with a reliability of about 98%. In our retrospective study of 18 tested individuals, most of the newly identified carriers function apparently well. They use avoidance and repression of affect as psychological defense strategies. However, 8 out of 9 non-carriers do not experience the expected relief about their test results. They experience survivor guilt and emotional numbness and find it difficult to cope with the effects of the test results on the family system. The partners of gene-carriers are at risk of becoming emotionally isolated by putting aside their own feelings for fear of seeming self-centered. Appreciation of these effects on tested individuals is important and professional support is needed to prevent post-traumatic stress disorders. Whatever the test result may be, the working through process may take years rather than months. These findings have important implications for patient care and necessitate an extended period of observation after presymptomatic testing. ? 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), which is caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11, is the most common benign neoplasm of the larynx among children and the second most frequent cause of childhood hoarseness. After changes in voice, stridor is the second most common symptom, first inspiratory and then biphasic. Less common presenting symptoms include chronic cough, recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive, dyspnea, dysphagia, or acute respiratory distress, especially in infants with an upper respiratory tract infection. Differential diagnoses include asthma, croup, allergies, vocal nodules, or bronchitis. Reports estimate the incidence of RRP in the United States at 4.3 per 100,000 children and 1.8 per 100,000 adults. Infection in children has been associated with vertical transmission during vaginal delivery from an infected mother. Younger age at diagnosis is associated with more aggressive disease and the need for more frequent surgical procedures to decrease the airway burden. When surgical therapy is needed more frequently than four times in 12 months or there is evidence of RRP outside the larynx, adjuvant medical therapy should be considered. Adjuvant therapies that have been investigated include dietary supplements, control of extra-esophageal reflux disease, potent antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents, and photodynamic therapies; although several have shown promise, none to date has ?cured? RRP, and some may have serious side effects. Because RRP, although histologicallybenign, is so difficult to control and can cause severe morbidity and death, better therapies are needed. The potential for a quadrivalent human papilloma vaccine is being explored to reduce the incidence of this disease.

AB  - The success of a robust vertebrate inflammatory response is in part because of the migratory potential of its haematopoietic components. Once these cells converge at an inflammatory site, they interact with each other as well as non-immune tissues and infectious agents to help manage both the scale and the duration of any ensuing response. Exactly how these blood cells, that constitute the innate and adaptive immune systems, contribute to such immune responses remain largely unknown. Traditionally, assessing these contributions relied upon histological analysis of fixed tissue sections complemented with in vitro dynamic data. Although informative, translating results from these studies into the multicellular whole-animal setting remain difficult. Recently, non-invasive live imaging of the immune system in animal models is providing significant insights into how immune cells function within their intact natural environment. Although the majority of these studies have been conducted within mice, another vertebrate, the zebrafish Danio rerio is being recognized as an ideal platform for non-invasive live imaging applications. The optical transparency, rapid development, genetic tractability and highly conserved innate and adaptive immune systems of this well-established developmental model have been exploited in a number of recent studies evaluating the immunocompetence of fluorescently tagged blood cells. In addition, similar live imaging studies are helping to dissect the ontogeny of blood-cell development by tracking various haematopoietic precursor cells to assess their contribution to different blood lineages. This review will examine some recent advances that have helped D. rerio emerge as a live imaging platform as well as its potential to offer valuable insights into the genetics behind diseases associated with immune cell dysfunction.

AB  - Summary It has recently been appreciated that patients with severe sepsis and septic shock suffer from altered innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to an impaired clearance of microorganisms. This explains their difficulty to fight their primary bacterial infection and their propensity to develop superinfections. A depressed immunological surveillance in some of these patients is also responsible for a reactivation of dormant viruses, such as cytomegalovirus. Leukocyte functions are profoundly affected during sepsis. Circulating phagocytes show a marked decrease in their capacity to mount a proinflammatory reaction in response to microorganisms. Monocytes express low levels of major histocompatibility class II molecules. These phenotypic changes are known as ?immune paralysis?. Massive lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis has also been reported in patients dying of sepsis, responsible, at least in part, for the impairment of adaptive responses. This was highlighted by the defective skin tests to common antigens documented already three decades ago in patients with sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may therefore benefit from treatments aimed at stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. The aims of immune stimulation are: (1) to help bacterial killing at the primary focus of infection; (2) to prevent the development of nosocomial infections; and (3) to prevent the reactivation of dormant viruses. Therapeutic strategies based on ?boosting? immune responses with interferon ?, G-CSF, and more recently with GM-CSF have been initiated. Although results of pilot studies are encouraging, these will need to be confirmed in larger clinical studies. As a word of caution, one should not induce deleterious overwhelming inflammatory reactions, and therefore close monitoring of immune and inflammatory responses during immune stimulation therapy is necessary.

AB  - Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alters both specific and nonspecific immune functions, resulting in immunosuppression. Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to improve the adaptive responses of the gut after surgery. The following study investigates the effects of adding short-chain fatty acids to TPN on the immune system after an 80% small bowel resection. Methods: Rats (237 ± 3 g) were infused with either TPN (n = 25) or TPN supplemented with short-chain fatty acids (n = 26) for 3 or 7 days. Hematologic analysis was performed on peripheral blood and splenocytes were isolated to characterize cell phenotypes, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and to estimate proliferative response. Results: The relative percent of T (CD3+) cells increased (p <.05) and the relative percent of macrophages decreased (p <.001, n = 13) in the spleens of the 3-day TPN-fed rats. By day 7, these differences disappeared. The natural killer cells from rats that were supplemented with short-chain fatty acids had higher (p <.0001) cytotoxic activity than the TPN groups at day 3. Mitogenic response did not differ between groups but were depressed compared with sham-treated rats. By day 7, rats on standard TPN had larger (p <.0001) spleens than all other groups. This group also had a higher total white blood cell count because of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (p <.02). Conclusion: Short-chain fatty acids improve components of nonspecific immune responses and may be beneficial in reducing certain aspects of TPNassociated immunosuppression after major surgery.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - Summary Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base-derived products, DNA?protein cross-links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen-binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8-hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its pathogenesis. Increased apoptosis and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells as observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might well be a contributory factor in systemic autoimmunity. Clinically, titres of autoantibodies are closely related to the degree of renal inflammation. Anti-DNA antibodies may combine with circulating antigen and contribute to the deposition of immune complexes in renal glomeruli.

AB  - Abstract A panel of monoclonal antibodies with well-defined specificities were used as probes to investigate the phenotypes and lineage of circulating lymphoid cells and splenocytes in untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease. A signficant relative and absolute reduction in T cells (anti-T3+) was found only in patients with B-symptoms. There was no alteration in the fraction of helper (anti-T4+) or cytotoxic/suppressor (anti-T5+) T cells circulating in peripheral blood when compared to normals, nor was there activation of these cells as measured by the development of surface Ia (anti-I1+). Circulating T cell subsets were not altered 5 to 14 days after splenectomy. Splenic T cells were increased equally in involved and uninvolved spleen when compared with control spleens obtained from accident victims. These findings indicate that abnormal T cell function in Hodgkin's disease may be the result of subtle alterations in T cells or non-T immunoregulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Abstract Breakdown in gastrointestinal mucosal integrity may be due to increased aggressive factors, including an excessive inflammatory response, decreased mucosal defence or a combination of the two. Our understanding of the control processes underlying these changes has rapidly expanded over the last decade and it is becoming clear that rather than being distinct elements, inflammation and repair are interrelated processes mediated by common cytokines and growth factors, with the division of factors as being a cytokine or a growth factor being somewhat artificial. The use of biological therapies, such as antibodies that cause receptor blockade or administering recombinant growth factors, has now progressed from the laboratory to the clinical arena. This review summarizes current thoughts on the use of these factors in general, but with particular emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease.
