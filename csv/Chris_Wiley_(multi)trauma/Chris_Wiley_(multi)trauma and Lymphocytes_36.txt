AB  - Abstract Breakdown in gastrointestinal mucosal integrity may be due to increased aggressive factors, including an excessive inflammatory response, decreased mucosal defence or a combination of the two. Our understanding of the control processes underlying these changes has rapidly expanded over the last decade and it is becoming clear that rather than being distinct elements, inflammation and repair are interrelated processes mediated by common cytokines and growth factors, with the division of factors as being a cytokine or a growth factor being somewhat artificial. The use of biological therapies, such as antibodies that cause receptor blockade or administering recombinant growth factors, has now progressed from the laboratory to the clinical arena. This review summarizes current thoughts on the use of these factors in general, but with particular emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: Despite good success rates of osseointegrated oral implants, failures do occur. To minimize losses, failure mechanisms should be elucidated. Purpose: This study sought to describe the morphology of tissues surrounding late failed Brånemark implants in relation to their clinical and radiographic findings to acquire a better understanding of the etiologic factors. Material and Methods: Ten failed implants and their surrounding tissues were consecutively retrieved from nine patients after prosthesis placement (late losses). On radiographs, a radiolucent line was visible around nine clinically mobile implants. Tightening of the abutment screw evoked pain at seven mobile implants. Clinically, no other visual inflammatory sign or symptom was manifest. A fistula originated from one stable implant, surrounded on radiographs by a diffuse bone rarefaction. Retrieved implants were electrochemically dissolved. Intact tissue-implant thin (1 ?m) and ultrathin (70?80 nm) sections were analyzed with light and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Peri-implant marginal tissues displayed moderate inflammatory infiltrates located adjacent to and beneath the junctional epithelium. One patient affected by oral lichen planus displayed an intense lymphocyte/plasma cell-dominated immune reaction. Deep peri-implant tissues surrounding mobile implants consisted of a dense, fibrous tissue capsule with minimal inflammation. Epithelial downgrowth was observed around four implants. Small areas of nonmineralized bone in contact with the implant were noticed in the apical portion of two implants. One implant was almost entirely colonized by bacterial plaque with the exception of its apical portion, where bone-implant contact was observed. The stable implant was characterized by bone-implant contact. Conclusion: Altogether clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings indicated that two major etiologic factors might have been implicated in the failure process of the investigated implants: excessive occlusal load in relation to the bone-supporting capacity and, in two cases, infection.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that has emerged as a prevalent source of nosocomial infections, most frequently causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. The emergence of pan-drug resistant strains magnifies the problem by reducing viable treatment options and effectively increasing the mortality rate associated with Acinetobacter infections. In light of this rising threat, research on A.?baumannii epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis is accelerating. The recent development of both in vitro and in vivo models has enabled studies probing the host?Acinetobacter interface. Bacterial genetic screens and comparative genomic studies have led to the identification of several A.?baumannii virulence factors. Additionally, investigations into host defence mechanisms using animal models or cell culture have provided insight into the innate immune response to infection. This review highlights some of the key attributes of A.?baumannii virulence with an emphasis on bacterial interactions with the innate immune system.

AB  - The P2X7 receptor has been widely studied for its ATP-induced pro-inflammatory effect, but in the absence of a ligand, P2X7 has a second function as a scavenger receptor, which is active in the development of the human brain. The scavenger activity of P2X7 is only evident in the absence of serum but is fully active in cerebrospinal fluid. P2X7 on the cell surface is present as a membrane complex, and an attachment to non-muscle myosin of the cytoskeleton is required for particle engulfment. Selective antagonists of P2X7 pro-inflammatory function have little effect on phagocytosis, but inheritance of a variant haplotype spanning the P2RX7 and P2RX4 genes has been associated with loss of P2X7-mediated phagocytosis. Recent studies in mice suggest that the innate phagocytosis mediated by P2X7 receptors declines with ageing. Thus, defective P2X7-mediated phagocytosis may contribute to age-related neuro-degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration and primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Background: The presumed etiology and prevalence of pancreatic abnormalities in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have been controversial. We conducted a controlled (cross-sectional) study of patients with UC compared with non-UC controls to determine the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities in patients with UC and to determine if these are specific to UC using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Methods: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed on 79 unselected patients with UC and 45 non-UC controls, without a history of pancreatitis attack, between February 2000 and May 2003. Results: Among patients with UC, the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities was 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 8.3%-24.6%): coexisting dilatation and narrowing of the main pancreatic duct were found in 5; diffuse narrowing of pancreatic ducts in 5; and dilatation of pancreatic ductal branches in 3. These abnormalities were compatible with chronic pancreatitis. Among the controls, no pancreatic duct abnormality was found. Conclusions: Changes in the pancreatic duct were found in approximately one-sixth of patients with UC, none of whom had a history of overt pancreatitis. These pancreatic duct abnormalities are likely to be specific to patients with UC.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and disease progression are poorly understood, in part as a result of the lack of non-invasive methods to measure and monitor neurodegeneration in vivo. Sodium MRI is a topic of increasing interest in MS research as it allows the metabolic characterization of brain tissue in vivo, and integration with the structural information provided by 1H MRI, helping in the exploration of pathogenetic mechanisms and possibly offering insights into disease progression and monitoring of treatment outcomes. We present an up-to-date review of the sodium MRI application in MS organized into four main sections: (i) biological and pathogenetic role of sodium; (ii) brief overview of sodium imaging techniques; (iii) results of sodium MRI application in clinical studies; and (iv) future perspectives.

AB  - Summary Systemic inflammation can be investigated by changes in expression profiles of neutrophil receptors. Application of this technology for analysis of neutrophil phenotypes in diseased tissues is hampered by the absence of information regarding the modulation of neutrophil phenotypes after extravasation to tissues under non-inflammatory conditions. To fill this gap we measured the expression of neutrophil receptors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, which included both smokers and non-smokers. Blood and BALF neutrophils were identified by CD16bright/CD45dim cells, and triple-stained with antibodies directed against integrins, chemokine- and Fc?-receptors. BALF neutrophils of healthy volunteers showed an activated phenotype characterized by Mac-1 (CD11b)bright, L-selectin (CD62L)dim, intrecellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (CD54)bright, Fc?RII (CD32)bright, C5a receptor (CD88)bright and CD66bbright. A similar phenotype was observed for BALF neutrophils of patients affected by sarcoidosis. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a modulated expression of C5a receptor (CD88) and ICAM-1 (CD54) in neutrophils of sarcoidosis patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that neutrophils found in the lung exhibit an activated phenotype under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Summary Heterogeneity of dendritic cells (DC) is evident in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and determined, in part, by incompletely understood local environmental factors. Bacterial signalling is likely to be a dominant influence on precursor cells when recruited to the mucosa. We assessed the influence of commensal bacteria on DC differentiation and function. Murine bone marrow progenitors were exposed to Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium breve or Bifidobacterium infantis. Differences in cell surface phenotype and function were assessed. Myeloid differentiation factor 88?/? (MyD88) cells were used to determine the influence of Toll-like receptor signalling. While bacterial strains varied in impact, there was a consistent dose-dependent inhibition of DC differentiation with a shift toward a Gr-1+?CD11b+ monocyte-like phenotype. A single bacterium on a per cell basis (1?:?1) was sufficient to alter cell phenotype. The effect was only evident in early precursors. Enhanced interleukin-10 production correlated with increased Forkhead box P3 expression and reduced T-cell proliferation. The bacterial effect on DC differentiation was found to be MyD88-dependent. Signalling by enteric commensals through pattern recognition receptors on precursor cells alters DC differentiation and results in cells that are phenotypically monocyte-like and functionally suppressive. This may account for some of the features of mucosal immune tolerance to the microbiota.

AB  - Abstract Effective translational methodologies for knowledge representation are needed in order to make strides against the constellation of diseases that affect the world today. These diseases are defined by their mechanistic complexity, redundancy, and nonlinearity. Translational systems biology aims to harness the power of computational simulation to streamline drug/device design, simulate clinical trials, and eventually to predict the effects of drugs on individuals. The ability of agent-based modeling to encompass multiple scales of biological process as well as spatial considerations, coupled with an intuitive modeling paradigm, suggests that this modeling framework is well suited for translational systems biology. This review describes agent-based modeling and gives examples of its translational applications in the context of acute inflammation and wound healing. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Porocarcinomas are thought to be differentiated into the acrosyringeal portion of the sweat duct, and they are relatively rare. It may develop from a long standing eccrine poroma undergoing malignant transformation or may arise de novo. We evaluated pathological and immunohistocheimical findings of six cases of eccrine porocarcinoma. Special stains (PAS and PAS with diastase) and immunohistochemical stainings (CEA, CAM5.2, CK7, bcl-2, p53 protein, and MIB-1) were performed. We observed asymmetrical architecture, cytological pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, ductal differentiation, intracytoplasmic lumina, mitotic activity, and melanin colonization. Three patients were male and four patients were female. The average age was 76 years. The time interval from tumor onset to treatment ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The mean size was 3.2?cm, and the mean depth of invasion was 1.0?cm. Four tumors were found on the head, one on the hip, and one on the foot. Regional lymph node metastases were noted in one case. Microscopically, luminal spaces and intracytoplasmic lumina were noted in all cases. Immunohistochemically, the mean MIB-1 index was 41%. P53 immunoreactivity was detected in five cases. Interestingly, a case of porocarcinoma with lymph node metastases showed high mitotic figures as well as less lymphocytic infiltration.

On examination hundreds of discrete, palpable 1-mm projections were present on the upper torso and arms. Histopathology showed a small focus of acanthotic epidermis forming a small spire. Overlying the subtle epidermal elevation was a column of compact hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. Epidermal atrophy and dermal lymphocytic inflammation, characteristic of Flegel?s disease, were not observed. No features of keratosis pilaris were noted. A diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses was rendered. Relatively rare multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses is a non-follicular disorder of keratinization of unclear etiology. Previously ascribed names include, but are not limited to, disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and minute aggregate keratoses. A classification scheme with sporadic, post-inflammatory (recently challenged as another entity) and familial (autosomal dominant) types has been proposed. Other classifications are based on topography and histology or age of onset: early (20?s and 30?s) and late (40?s-50?s). Paraneoplastic syndromes have been associated with late onset type. In summary, we report a sporadic case of late-onset multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, an unusual and relatively rare disorder.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

Skin biopsies revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate involving the dermis and the subcutis in a lobular and septal pattern. No overt cytological atypia was present. Notably, several features resembling lupus erythematosus were present, including vacuolar interface change and abundant dermal mucin deposition. The patient developed pulmonary nodules, and a lung biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate without overt atypia. The cutaneous and pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates showed similar immunohistochemical profiles: CD3+CD4?CD8+/?CD56+. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma gene with similar migration patterns were identified from both locations. The patient developed fatal hemophagocytic syndrome, involving liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This case is amongst rare reports of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) with systemic involvement.

AB  - We report unique histologic findings in scalp biopsies from two family members with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. Rapp-Hodgkin and the related AEC syndrome show a primary scarring alopecia and pili torti. The syndromes, which are related to ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome, have been credited to mutations in the TP63 gene. Most notable on biopsy is a primary scarring alopecia and abnormal hair shaft shape. Calcification in the outer root sheath epithelium, the basement membrane of the lower segment and within naked hair shafts is present. Neutrophils and bacterial rods and cocci are adjacent to the hair shaft in the superior segment, associated with dilated follicular ostia. Perifollicular fibrosis is associated with a variety of inflammatory cell types, mostly lymphocytic. One sample shows interfollicular irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, compact orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intraepidermal neutrophils. Follicular architecture is abnormal with abrupt and linear loss of nucleated matrical cells (B fringe of Adamson). The line of Ayber measures 0.30?mm on average. Hair shafts measure up to 0.16?mm, with variable abnormal cross sectional shape, usually square. Outer root sheath epithelium is disorganized with slight cellular pleomorphism, and the cuticle of the inner and outer root sheath is irregular in thickness.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.
