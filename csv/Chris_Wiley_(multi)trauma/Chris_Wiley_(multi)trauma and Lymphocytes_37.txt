AB  - We report a 43-year-old woman, in otherwise excellent health, who presented with a 4 year history of an asymptomatic, papular condition described as ?tiny little spines? involving the skin. On examination hundreds of discrete, palpable 1-mm projections were present on the upper torso and arms. Histopathology showed a small focus of acanthotic epidermis forming a small spire. Overlying the subtle epidermal elevation was a column of compact hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. Epidermal atrophy and dermal lymphocytic inflammation, characteristic of Flegel?s disease, were not observed. No features of keratosis pilaris were noted. A diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses was rendered. Relatively rare multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses is a non-follicular disorder of keratinization of unclear etiology. Previously ascribed names include, but are not limited to, disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and minute aggregate keratoses. A classification scheme with sporadic, post-inflammatory (recently challenged as another entity) and familial (autosomal dominant) types has been proposed. Other classifications are based on topography and histology or age of onset: early (20?s and 30?s) and late (40?s-50?s). Paraneoplastic syndromes have been associated with late onset type. In summary, we report a sporadic case of late-onset multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, an unusual and relatively rare disorder.

AB  - Abstract Effective translational methodologies for knowledge representation are needed in order to make strides against the constellation of diseases that affect the world today. These diseases are defined by their mechanistic complexity, redundancy, and nonlinearity. Translational systems biology aims to harness the power of computational simulation to streamline drug/device design, simulate clinical trials, and eventually to predict the effects of drugs on individuals. The ability of agent-based modeling to encompass multiple scales of biological process as well as spatial considerations, coupled with an intuitive modeling paradigm, suggests that this modeling framework is well suited for translational systems biology. This review describes agent-based modeling and gives examples of its translational applications in the context of acute inflammation and wound healing. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - Abstract Progressively sophisticated understanding of cellular and molecular processes that contribute to age-related physical deterioration is being gained from ongoing research into cancer, chronic inflammatory syndromes and other serious disorders that increase with age. Particularly valuable insight has resulted from characterization of how senescent cells affect the tissues in which they form in ways that decrease an organism's overall viability. Increasingly, the underlying pathophysiology of ageing is recognized as a consequence of oxidative damage. This leads to hyperactivity of cell growth pathways, prominently including mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), that contribute to a build-up in cells of toxic aggregates such as progerin (a mutant nuclear cytoskeletal protein), lipofuscin and other cellular debris, triggering formation of senescent cellular phenotypes, which interact destructively with surrounding tissue. Indeed, senescent cell ablation dramatically inhibits physical deterioration in progeroid (age-accelerated) mice. This review explores ways in which oxidative stress creates ageing-associated cellular damage and triggers induction of the cell death/survival programs? apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and ?necroapoptophagy?. The concept of ?necroapoptophagy? is presented here as a strategy for varying tissue oxidative stress intensity in ways that induce differential activation of death versus survival programs, resulting in enhanced and sustained representation of healthy functional cells. These strategies are discussed in the context of specialized mesenchymal stromal cells with the potential to synergize with telocytes in stabilizing engrafted progenitor cells, thereby extending periods of healthy life. Information and concepts are summarized in a hypothetical approach to suppressing whole-organism senescence, with methods drawn from emerging understandings of ageing, gained from Cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and anemones) that undergo a unique form of cellular regeneration, potentially conferring open-ended lifespans.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - Objectives.? The phenomenon of inflammatory masses at the tips of intrathecal drug administration catheters was the subject of a recent case-compilation report and a number of animal studies. We sought to synthesize current clinical and preclinical data to formulate hypotheses about the etiology of catheter-tip masses. Methods.? We reviewed the published human clinical data, new unpublished clinical data, and the results of preclinical studies in two mammalian species, beagle dogs and sheep. Results. Intrathecal morphine sulfate studies in beagle dogs suggested that the observed inflammatory reaction was dose or concentration dependent. Masses occurred after 28 days in one of three animals at 1.5 mg/day (the lowest morphine dose tested); in two of three animals at 3 and 9 mg/day; and in three of three animals at 12 mg/day. The addition of various amounts of clonidine to 1.5 mg/day of morphine revealed no mass formation when the clonidine dose was>0.25 mg/day. A morphine sulfate study that was performed in sheep using a commercially marketed drug administration system found catheter tip masses in two of three animals that received 12 or 18 mg/day of morphine, the highest doses tested. Human cases have occurred only in pain patients who received intrathecal opioids, alone or mixed with other drugs, or in patients who received investigational agents (such as superoxide dismutase or the partial ??opioid-receptor agonist, tramadol) that were not labeled for long-term intrathecal use. Discussion/Conclusions. The evidence suggests that the long-term administration of opioids, especially morphine, caused the masses that were observed in humans and in two species of animals. A relationship probably exists between mass formation and intrathecal morphine doses or concentration. Other factors remain to be investigated.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

A number of natural and synthetic agents have been discovered that can modulate components of the immune system. Furthermore, cytokines, such as interleukins, and immune cells having specific markers, such as antibodies, continue to be defined, leading to a complex although incomplete picture of immune responses. The immune system and its responses are discussed. Immunomodulators that play a role in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome as well as those used in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune dysfunction, are described. Immunosuppressants used in anticancer therapy and organ transplants are presented.

AB  - Abstract To facilitate research cooperation among the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, ISAC supported the Epona Cytometry Conference in eastern Hungary near Debrecen and the Hortobágy National Park. This was the first ISAC sponsored conference held in Hungary. The 150 attendees included scientists from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. There was also representation from Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Presentations and posters were of typically high ISAC quality. In addition, the Epona meeting attracted an impressive selection of commercial exhibits that provided contacts and improved the awareness of advanced analytical cytology for the attendees. The Epona conference was organized with Hungarian passion and skill by Professor Sandor Damjanovich, Dr. Jànos Szollosi, and the members of the Biophysics and Cell Biology Department of the Medical School of Debrecen. The Department has been active in cytometry for over 20 years, and in hosting the conference, it also celebrated the 20th anniversary of its installment of the first cell sorter in Eastern Europe. The successful meeting demonstrates that Hungarians are strong contenders for the organization of future ISAC meetings. During my 1999 Fulbright Scholarship in Professor Damjanovich's Department, I traveled extensively and can verify that there are other unique sites in Hungary?Sopron, Pécs, Lake Balaton, and Budapest?for ISAC meetings. The site of the conference was on the Hungarian Puszta or plain near the Hortobágy National Park, which offered tours to observe ?Hungarian Cowboys,? long-horned cattle, twisted-horn sheep, hairy pigs, and water buffalo, which were brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Magyars. Located in beautiful grasslands on the edge of the Park, the Epona Village was an excellent site for the meeting and is distinctly Hungarian. The timing of the conference was dramatic. Hungary was admitted to NATO in April and the Kosovo conflict with Yugoslavia began a few weeks later. During the conference, NATO air raids into Kosovo were being conducted from bases in southern Hungary. There was much concerned discussion among the attendees of the Kosovo situation. All regretted the loss of life, and all shared the hope that creating cooperative projects in science, agriculture, business, and education will lower international tension. In supporting the Epona conference, ISAC contributed importantly to cooperative science.

AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.

AB  - Abstract Over the course of 4?weeks, two female aged bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) group-housed females died after the dominant male was removed from the group and the newly dominant male persistently chased, caught and bred all females in the pen. The two aged affected females were observed exhibiting lethargy, dyspnea, with widespread necroulcerative lesions in and around the mouth, muzzle and bridge of their noses. Extensive ulcerative glossitis, necrotic bronchopneumonia with intra-nuclear inclusions and the absence of other evidence is highly suggestive that death was caused by an alphaherpes virus commonly known as herpes B virus. Herpes B virus is a potentially zoonotic disease periodically shed by macaques, which is structurally related to herpes simplex viruses I and II of humans. The emergence of fatal B virus to primates in this pen may have been associated with the combination of age and stress in the affected individuals.

AB  - Abstract Kindlin-1 is an epithelium-specific phosphoprotein and focal adhesion adaptor component. Mutations in the corresponding gene (KIND1) cause Kindler syndrome (KS), which is manifested by skin blistering, poikiloderma, photosensitivity and carcinogenesis. Some patients also exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, but it has remained unclear whether these represent a feature of Kindler syndrome or a coincidence. We examined kindlin-1 in human gastrointestinal epithelia and showed that it is involved in the aetiopathology of Kindler syndrome-associated colitis. Kindlin-1 expression was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, western blot and RT?PCR. Kindlin-1 is expressed in oral mucosa, colon and rectum. Both the full-length 74 kDa kindlin-1 protein and a 43 kDa isoform were detected in CaCo2 cells, the latter resulting from alternative splicing. In the first months of life, patients (homozygous for null mutations) had severe intestinal involvement with haemorrhagic diarrhoea and showed morphological features of severe ulcerative colitis. Later in childhood, histopathology demonstrated focal detachment of the epithelium in all segments of the colon, chronic inflammation and mucosal atrophy. These findings define an intestinal phenotype for Kindler syndrome as a consequence of a primary epithelial barrier defect. The different clinical intestinal manifestations in Kindler syndrome patients may be explained by partial functional compensation of kindlin-1 deficiency by the intestinal isoform or by the presence of truncated mutant kindlin-1.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases affecting humans. Dental biofilm is a contributor to the etiology of most periodontal diseases. It is also widely accepted that immunological and inflammatory responses to biofilm components are manifested by signs and symptoms of periodontal disease. The outcome of such interaction is modulated by risk factors (modifiers), either inherent (genetic) or acquired (environmental), significantly affecting the initiation and progression of different periodontal disease phenotypes. While definitive genetic determinants responsible for either susceptibility or resistance to periodontal disease have yet to be identified, many factors affecting the pathogenesis have been described, including smoking, diabetes, obesity, medications, and nutrition. Currently, periodontal diseases are classified based upon clinical disease traits using radiographs and clinical examination. Advances in genomics, molecular biology, and personalized medicine may result in new guidelines for unambiguous disease definition and diagnosis in the future. Recent studies have implied relationships between periodontal diseases and systemic conditions. Answering critical questions regarding host-parasite interactions in periodontal diseases may provide new insight in the pathogenesis of other biomedical disorders. Therapeutic efforts have focused on the microbial nature of the infection, as active treatment centers on biofilm disruption by non-surgical mechanical debridement with antimicrobial and sometimes anti-inflammatory adjuncts. The surgical treatment aims at gaining access to periodontal lesions and correcting unfavorable gingival/osseous contours to achieve a periodontal architecture that will provide for more effective oral hygiene and periodontal maintenance. In addition, advances in tissue engineering have provided innovative means to regenerate/repair periodontal defects, based upon principles of guided tissue regeneration and utilization of growth factors/biologic mediators. To maintain periodontal stability, these treatments need to be supplemented with long-term maintenance (supportive periodontal therapy) programs.

AB  - Summary 1 The results have been described of an experimental investigation undertaken to determine the relative merits of a number of different suture materials for the repair of severed nerves. 2 Fine plain catgut, white silk and human hair are the most suitable materials for repairing nerves. Of these three silk has a slight advantage over plain catgut when technical factors as well as those associated with the reaction induced by the suture material are taken into consideration. 3 The outcome following nerve suture does not depend solely on the type of suture material employed but to a large degree on the manner in which it is used to unite the nerve ends. The principles which should govern the method of application of sutures in peripheral nerve surgery have been detailed.

Transcription factors from the Pax gene family, Pax3 and Pax7, are critical for satellite cell biogenesis, survival and potentially self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. This is particularly true in the case of Pax7, which appears to regulate myogenesis at multiple levels. Accordingly, recent data have highlighted the importance of a functional relationship between Pax7 and the MyoD family of muscle regulatory transcription factors during normal muscle formation and disease. Here we will critically review key findings suggesting that Pax7 may play a dual role by promoting resident muscle progenitors to commit to the skeletal muscle lineage while preventing terminal differentiation, thus keeping muscle progenitors poised to differentiate upon environmental cues. In addition, potential regulatory mechanisms for the control of Pax7 activity will be proposed.

AB  - Summary The high mortality in neonatal sepsis has been related to both quantitative and qualitative differences in host protective immunity. Pretreatment strategies to prevent sepsis have received inadequate consideration, especially in the premature neonate, where outcomes from sepsis are so dismal. Aluminium salts-based adjuvants (alum) are used currently in many paediatric vaccines, but their use as an innate immune stimulant alone has not been well studied. We asked whether pretreatment with alum adjuvant alone could improve outcome and host innate immunity in neonatal mice given polymicrobial sepsis. Subcutaneous alum pretreatment improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis in both wild-type and T and B cell-deficient neonatal mice, but not in caspase-1/11 null mice. Moreover, alum increases peritoneal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis, and decreases bacterial colonization in the peritoneum. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from alum-pretreated neonates produce more neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and exhibit increased expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) after in-vitro stimulation with phorbol esters. In addition, alum pretreatment increases bone marrow and splenic haematopoietic stem cell expansion following sepsis. Pretreatment of neonatal mice with an alum-based adjuvant can stimulate multiple innate immune cell functions and improve survival. These novel findings suggest a therapeutic pathway for the use of existing alum-based adjuvants for preventing sepsis in premature infants.

AB  - Abstract Basic phenotyping of inbred mouse strains and genetically modified mouse models usually includes the determination of blood-based parameters as a diagnostic screen for genotype effects on metabolism and organ function. A broad range of analytes, including hematological parameters, can be reliably determined in mouse blood, if appropriate samples are available. Here we describe recommended techniques for blood collection from mice and the considerations that have to be taken into account to get adequate samples for hematological investigations. Furthermore, we describe established methods used in the German Mouse Clinic (GMC) to determine hematological parameters in the mouse. Curr. Protoc.
