AB  - Abstract This study was aimed to compare the subjective and objective nutritional assessments and to analyse the performance of subjective global assessment (SGA) of nutritional status in diagnosing undernutrition in paediatric patients. One hundred and forty children (aged 2?12 years) hospitalized consecutively in Tabriz Paediatric Hospital from June 2008 to August 2008 underwent subjective assessment using the SGA questionnaire and objective assessment, including anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Agreement between two assessment methods was analysed by the kappa (?) statistic. Statistical indicators including (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, error rates, accuracy, powers, likelihood ratios and odds ratio) between SGA and objective assessment method were determined. The overall prevalence of undernutrition according to the SGA (70.7%) was higher than that by objective assessment of nutritional status (48.5%). Agreement between the two evaluation methods was only fair to moderate (??=?0.336, P?<?0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the SGA method for screening undernutrition in this population were 88.235%, 45.833%, 60.606% and 80.487%, respectively. Accuracy, positive and negative power of the SGA method were 66.428%, 56.074% and 41.25%, respectively. Likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative and odds ratio of the SGA method were 1.628, 0.256 and 6.359, respectively. Our findings indicated that in assessing nutritional status of children, there is not a good level of agreement between SGA and objective nutritional assessment. In addition, SGA is a highly sensitive tool for assessing nutritional status and could identify children at risk of developing undernutrition.

AB  - Summary Granulomatous disorders affecting the skin belong to a heterogeneous group of diseases. With the exception of granulomas induced by infectious agents or foreign bodies, the etiopathogenesis of granulomatous disorders is still poorly understood. The knowledge of histopathologic changes is of great importance for understanding clinical presentation and disease course.

AB  - Localized chrysiasis is rare and can occur in two settings: after localized or traumatic implantation of elemental gold or gold salts or after localized laser or light therapy in someone who has been previously exposed to systemic gold therapy. We report a unique case of localized chrysiasis with associated aluminum salt deposition and sclerosing lipogranulomas because of previous injections of aurothioglucose (Solganal?). The unique histopathologic findings seen in this case have not been previously reported.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Background and Objectives? G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells have long replaced marrow as the major source for allogeneic transplants. Conclusive evidence questioning the long-term safety of G-CSF for donors has not been provided, but the cumulative number of followed donors remains insufficient to rule out rare adverse events. A long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors was therefore performed. Patients and Methods? Two hundred and three successive donors were evaluated pre-apheresis, subjected to G-CSF-mobilization/apheresis, and actively followed for 5?years by the same physicians and laboratories. Follow-up laboratory work included standard biochemical/haematological tests and T-cell phenotyping. Results? Donor epidemiology was typical for reported stem cell donor cohorts. Acute adverse effects of G-CSF and apheresis were mild and transient, consistent with the previous reports. Mean circulating CD34+ cells after nine doses of G-CSF were 124 per ?l. Other biochemical/haematological parameters were also altered, consistent with G-CSF treatment. Spleen enlargement was modest. At first follow-up, all clinical and laboratory parameters had normalized. Leucocyte/lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were the same as during premobilization work-up and remained unchanged throughout. A single severe but likely unrelated adverse event, a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma, was reported. Conclusion? The studies add an observation time of almost 500 donor years to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogeneic donor stem cell mobilization.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.
