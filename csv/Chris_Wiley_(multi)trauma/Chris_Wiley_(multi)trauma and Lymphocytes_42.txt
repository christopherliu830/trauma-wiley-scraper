AB  - Older age, prior transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, and mechanical support are commonly seen in current potential cardiac transplant recipients. Transplants in 436 consecutive adult patients from 1994 to 1999 were reviewed. There were 251 using standard donors in 243 patients (age range 18?69 years). To emphasize recipient risk, 185 patients who received a nonstandard donor were excluded from analysis. The indications for transplant were ischemic heart disease (n?=?123, 47%), dilated cardiomyopathy (n?=?82, 32%), and others (n?=?56, 21%). One hundred and forty-nine (57%) recipients were listed as status I; 5 and 6% were supported with an intra-aortic balloon and an assist device, respectively. The 30-d survival and survival to discharge were 94.7 and 92.7%, respectively; 1-year survival was 89.1%. Causes of early death were graft failure (n?=?6), infection (n?=?4), stroke (n?=?4), multiorgan failure (n?=?3) and rejection (n?=?2). Predictors were balloon pump use alone (OR?=?11.4, p =?0.002), pulmonary vascular resistance > 4 Wood units (OR?=?5.7, p =?0.007), pretransplant creatinine > 2.0?mg/dL (OR?=?6.9, p =?0.004) and female donor (OR?=?8.3, p =?0.002). Recipient age and previous surgery did not affect short-term survival. Heart transplantation in the current era consistently offers excellent early and 1-year survival for well-selected recipients receiving standard donors. Early mortality tends to reflect graft failure while hospital mortality may be more indicative of recipient selection.

AB  - Abstract A liquid collagen has been developed that fibrilizes upon injection. Rapid polymerizing collagen (RPC) is a type I porcine collagen that undergoes fibrillization upon interaction with ionic solutions, such as physiological solutions. The ability to inject liquid collagen would be beneficial for many soft tissue augmentation applications. In this study, RPC was synthesized and characterized as a possible dermal filler. Transmission electron microscopy, ion induced RPC fibrillogenesis tests, collagenase resistance assay, and injection force studies were performed to assess RPC's physicochemical properties. An in vivo study was performed which consisted of a 1-, 3-, and 6-month study where RPC was injected into the ears of miniature swine. The results demonstrated that the liquid RPC requires low injection force (<7 N); fibrillogenesis and banding of collagen occurs when RPC is injected into ionic solutions, and RPC has enhanced resistance to collagenase breakdown. The in vivo study demonstrated long-term biocompatibility with low irritation scores. In conclusion RPC possesses many of the desirable properties of a soft tissue augmentation material. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 104A: 758?767, 2016.

AB  - Abstract? Histological assessment of the dental pulps of 55 carious primary teeth was carried out 3 to 56 months after treatment by the ?atraumatic? technique involving application of 40 per cent silver fluoride to residual caries followed by restoration with glass ionomer cement. Fifty of the 55 teeth examined showed a favourable pulpal response, including presence of abundant reparative dentine and a wide odontoblast layer. Histological comparisons were made between these teeth and others not treated with silver fluoride but restored with glass ionomer cement, amalgam or zinc oxide and eugenol. Possible mechanisms of the action of silver fluoride in arresting residual caries are discussed. The question of whether or not treatment of carious dentine with silver fluoride represents a biologically acceptable clinical procedure cannot be answered on the basis of pulpal histology alone. The very high concentration of fluoride in commercial preparations of silver fluoride raises several questions concerning its clinical safety.

AB  - Abstract Background? Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). Methods? We report the atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a 36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu?s arteritis. Results? Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole monotherapy. Conclusion? The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Summary Tattooing has been around since the early beginnings of modern civilization. The discovery of selective photothermolysis at last has made it possible to remove tattoos without leaving a scar. Q-switched neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet, alexandrite, and ruby lasers with pulse durations in the nanosecond domain fulfill this need. Argon or cw-CO2 lasers as well as intense pulsed light sources should not be used since they often produce significant scarring. This article provides an overview of current laser systems.Developments leading to new tattoo inks, feedback systems to detect the absorbance characteristics of tattoo inks, dermal clearing agents, and perhaps even lasers with shorter pulse-durations might improve the results in the future.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion proteins directed towards cell surface targets make an important contribution to the treatment of disease. The purpose of this review was to correlate the clinical and preclinical data on the 15 currently approved mAbs and fusion proteins targeted to the cell surface. The principal sources used to gather data were: the peer reviewed Literature; European Medicines Agency ?Scientific Discussions?; and the US Food and Drug Administration ?Pharmacology/Toxicology Reviews? and package inserts (United States Prescribing Information). Data on the 15 approved biopharmaceuticals were included: abatacept; abciximab; alefacept; alemtuzumab; basiliximab; cetuximab; daclizumab; efalizumab; ipilimumab; muromonab; natalizumab; panitumumab; rituximab; tocilizumab; and trastuzumab. For statistical analysis of concordance, data from these 15 were combined with data on the approved mAbs and fusion proteins directed towards soluble targets. Good concordance with human pharmacodynamics was found for mice receiving surrogates or non-human primates (NHPs) receiving the human pharmaceutical. In contrast, there was poor concordance for human pharmacodynamics in genetically deficient mice and for human adverse effects in all three test systems. No evidence that NHPs have superior predictive value was found.

AB  - ABSTRACT TNF-α and IL-17 secreted by proinflammatory T cells (TEFF) promote bone erosion by activating osteoclasts. We previously demonstrated that in addition to bone resorption, osteoclasts act as antigen-presenting cells to induce FoxP3 in CD8 T cells (TcREG). The osteoclast-induced regulatory CD8 T cells limit bone resorption in ovariectomized mice (a murine model of postmenopausal osteoporosis). Here we show that although low-dose receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) maximally induces TcREG via Notch signaling pathway to limit bone resorption, high-dose RANKL promotes bone resorption. In vitro, both TNF-α and IL-17, cytokines that are abundant in ovariectomized animals, suppress TcREG induction by osteoclasts by repressing Notch ligand expression in osteoclasts, but this effect can be counteracted by addition of RANKL. Ovariectomized mice treated with low-dose RANKL induced TcREG that suppressed bone resorption, decreased TEFF levels, and increased bone formation. High-dose RANKL had the expected osteolytic effect. Low-dose RANKL administration in ovariectomized mice lacking CD8 T cells was also osteolytic, confirming that TcREG mediate this bone anabolic effect. Our results show that although RANKL directly stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, it also controls the osteoclasts' ability to induce regulatory T cells, engaging an important negative feedback loop. In addition to the conceivable clinical relevance to treatment of osteoporosis, these observations have potential relevance to induction of tolerance and autoimmune diseases. ? 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
