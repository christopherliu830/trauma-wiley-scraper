AB  - We analysed cytomorphological characteristics of three fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples of acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (AMIFS) as well as the features of a number of other benign and malignant myxoid lesions. The analysis showed that FNAB samples from two cases of AMIFS had similar cytomorphology, containing all the characteristic features described in surgical biopsies: myxoid material, spindle cells with bipolar cytoplasmic extensions, epithelioid cells with globules of extra-cellular material, ganglion-like and lipoblast-like giant cells. Only the inflammatory component was scarce. The third sample did not contain features typical of AMIFS. Samples from other myxoid tumours resembled AMIFS to some extent, however, none of them contained all three tumour components characteristic of AMIFS. Cytomorphology of AMIFS may be characteristic enough to enable a definitive diagnosis from FNAB, provided all the distinctive features are sampled.

AB  - Abstract Neuropeptides with C-terminal RFamide and their receptors NPFF1 (FF1) and NPFF2 (FF2) have been implicated in a wide variety of functions, including nociception and autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation. Recent studies indicate that the FF1, but not FF2, mRNA is highly expressed in the human hypothalamus. In the present study, localization of FF1 in the human hypothalamus and surrounding regions was studied immunohistochemically by using an antibody against human FF1 (hFF1). Brain sections from healthy 30?50-year-old individuals were used for hFF1 immunohistochemistry. The highest density of hFF1-stained cells was found in the posterior division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in the zona incerta. A moderate density of cells was observed in the perifornical nucleus, infundibular nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, and lateral tuberal nucleus. A lesser density was revealed in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, basal nucleus of Meynert, and anterior amygdaloid area. Only scattered hFF1 cells were found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. hFF1 cells and fibers were absent in the supraoptic and mammillary nuclei. Single and double strands of hFF1-immunopositive punctate varicosities marked cellular processes of different caliber. The density of hFF1-immunostained fiber networks did not always coincide with that of hFF1-immunostained cells. hFF1 immunoreactivity was also found in the wall of blood vessels within most brain areas studied. Localization of hFF1 in discrete regions of the hypothalamus and extended amygdala may provide important insights into the role of amidated neuropeptides in central autonomic and neuroendocrine control in the human brain.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - Summary Inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. The lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. This is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (HTS) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. HTS diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of DNA samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. Increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. Our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. In the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - Summary A system was developed for objective prediction of survival, which could be applied to all critically ill patients, regardless of disease, at an early stage of hospitaluation. Such a system would allow risk assessment of groups for experimental studies according to probability of survival and it might allow us to avoid expenditure of scarce clinical resources on animals with little chance of survival. The prospective study included 200 critically ill dogs: 93 females and 107 males, representing 62 breeds. With survival defined as alive 30 days after admisssion to ICU the overall mortality rate was 40.5% (81 of 200 dogs). Data collected included signalment and parameters that reflected vital organ function, the severity of physiologic derangement and the extent of physiologic reserve. We recorded the most abnormal value for each parameter within 24 hours of admission to ICU and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze four different weighting systems. The best model had a concordance 0f 86.5% with outcome, and it was then re-evaluated to determine whether individual variables could be eliminated without losing predictive accuracy. Fourvariables were eliminated, resulting in a final model with 18 variables which had 86.3% concordance with outcome. At a 0.5 cut-off for predicted risk, the model had sensitivity Of 69%, specificity ficity of 86% and positive predictive value of 77%. A Receiver Operating Curve was constructed using serial cut-offs for predicted outcome from 0.1 to 0.9, and the area under the curve was 0.89. Thus, an equation was generated that gives an estimate of the probability of survival.

AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) represent a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive rapidly progressive necrosis that may involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia or muscle. Their progress is extremely fast, leading often to sepsis and septic shock that ends up in multiple organ failure with abrupt and high mortality. A variety of classification systems have been developed based on parameters such as anatomic location of the disease or microbiology. There are a number of factors that predispose to the spread of these soft tissue infections, such as delays in recognition, immune suppression, diabetes mellitus and advanced age. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics tends to mask the severity of the underlying infection, modulates the clinical presentation, and even delays hospital admission. The most important factor affecting outcome in NSTI is early diagnosis and aggressive radical surgical treatment. The medical records of 13 patients who had been treated for NSTI from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed, retrospectively. There were eight men (61.5%) and five (38.5%) women. Mean age was 56?years (range 27?73). Seven cases of infection involved the perineal region (54%), two the lower limb, one the upper limb and three the abdominal wall/trunk. The most common associated comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in five patients (38.5%). A single organism was identified in two (15%) and multiple organisms in 11 (85%) patients. Necrotizing aponeurositis Type I was the most common of the polymicrobial necrotizing infections. Overall survival was 85%, and the mean hospital stay for survivors was 35 days (range 17?92).

AB  - Abstract Objective Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are considered atheroprotective, and low levels have been associated with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS. However, the functional properties as well as homeostasis of Tregs are mainly unknown in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we investigated the composition and functional properties of naïve (n) and memory (m)Tregs in patients with NSTE-ACS and in patients 6?12 months post-ACS. Methods Based on the expression of CD25, FOXP3, CD127, CD45RA, CD39 and CTLA-4, Treg subsets were defined by flow cytometry in whole blood or isolated CD4+ T cells. The functional properties of nTregs and mTregs were examined in terms of proliferative capacity and modulation of cytokine secretion. To understand the potential consequences of Treg defects, we also investigated correlations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine secretion and ultrasound-defined carotid atherosclerosis. Results Both NSTE-ACS and post-ACS patients exhibited reduced levels of nTregs (P < 0.001) compared with healthy control subjects, but without compensatory increases in mTregs. Both nTregs and mTregs from patients showed significantly lower replicative rates and impaired capacity to modulate T-cell proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-10. The Treg defect was also associated with LPS-induced cytokine secretion and increased burden of carotid atherosclerosis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a functional and homeostatic Treg defect in patients with NSTE-ACS and also in stabilized patients 6?12 months after ACS. Moreover, this defect was associated with a subclinical proinflammatory and atherogenic state. We believe that the failure to preserve Treg function and homeostasis reflects a need for immune-restoring strategies in CAD.

AB  - Abstract Thirty-four (34) days after arrival at our facility, a recently imported rhesus macaque demonstrated a grade 4/5 reaction to intradermal testing with mammalian old tuberculin and a strong positive response in a serum interferon gamma (IFN-?) stimulation assay (Primagam?). The affected animal was euthanized to prevent further exposure of the other rhesus in the quarantine room. Necropsy revealed enlarged, caseating mediastinal lymph nodes. Further analysis confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms. Strict isolation measures were initiated and intensive testing of all animals in the affected room began immediately. After 13?weeks of additional testing, none of the animals in the room showed any positive response and all were released from quarantine. This case illustrates the importance of prolonged quarantine of non-human primates (NHP) and illustrates the usefulness of serology-based diagnostics as an adjunct to intradermal testing (molecular-based diagnostics typically refers to polymerase chain reaction, whereas this assay is really serology based, even though it is an in vitro IFN-? stimulation assay). It also demonstrates that with proper isolation procedures, the spread of tuberculosis can be prevented in NHP facilities.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
