AB  - Abstract Thirty-four (34) days after arrival at our facility, a recently imported rhesus macaque demonstrated a grade 4/5 reaction to intradermal testing with mammalian old tuberculin and a strong positive response in a serum interferon gamma (IFN-?) stimulation assay (Primagam?). The affected animal was euthanized to prevent further exposure of the other rhesus in the quarantine room. Necropsy revealed enlarged, caseating mediastinal lymph nodes. Further analysis confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms. Strict isolation measures were initiated and intensive testing of all animals in the affected room began immediately. After 13?weeks of additional testing, none of the animals in the room showed any positive response and all were released from quarantine. This case illustrates the importance of prolonged quarantine of non-human primates (NHP) and illustrates the usefulness of serology-based diagnostics as an adjunct to intradermal testing (molecular-based diagnostics typically refers to polymerase chain reaction, whereas this assay is really serology based, even though it is an in vitro IFN-? stimulation assay). It also demonstrates that with proper isolation procedures, the spread of tuberculosis can be prevented in NHP facilities.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Summary:? The interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts is regulated by reciprocal survival strategies, including competition for essential nutrients. Though paradoxical, mammalian hosts have learned to take advantage of amino acid catabolism for controlling pathogen invasion and, at the same time, regulating their own immune responses. In this way, ancient catabolic enzymes have acquired novel functions and evolved into new structures with highly specialized functions, which go beyond the struggle for survival. In this review, we analyze the evidence supporting a critical role for the metabolism of various amino acids in regulating different steps of both innate and adaptive immunity.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.

AB  - Summary Mesenchymal tumors include those tumors arising from the supporting mesenchymal tissues of the dermis and subcutis (fibrous connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle) and those round cell tumors of mesenchymal origin that present as cutaneous masses. The tumors have been classified using the revised International Histological Classification of Skin Tumors and Tumor-like Lesions of Domestic Animals. Myxomas/myxosarcomas are rare, occurring in middle-aged or older dogs and cats. Leiomyomas are rare in the skin and soft tissue. Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcomas in humans; they occur in all domestic species but are rare. Hemangiomas can occur in very young horses, usually on the distal limbs. Hemangiosarcoma most commonly presents as a multicentric disease involving the spleen, liver, lungs, and right auricle of dogs, especially the German shepherd and golden retriever breeds.
