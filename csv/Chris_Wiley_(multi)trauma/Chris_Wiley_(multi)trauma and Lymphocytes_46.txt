AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Degradation products of metallic biomaterials including titanium may result in metal hypersensitivity reaction. Hypersensitivity to biomaterials is often described in terms of vague pain, skin rashes, fatigue and malaise and in some cases implant loss. Recently, titanium hypersensitivity has been suggested as one of the factors responsible for implant failure. Although titanium hypersensitivity is a growing concern, epidemiological data on incidence of titanium-related allergic reactions are still lacking. Materials and methods: A computer search of electronic databases primarily MEDLINE and PUBMED was performed with the following key words: ?titanium hypersensitivity?, ?titanium allergy?, ?titanium release? without any language restriction. Manual searches of the bibliographies of all the retrieved articles were also performed. In addition, a complementary hand search was also conducted to identify recent articles and case reports. Results: Most of the literature comprised case reports and prospective in vivo/in vitro trials. One hundred and twenty-seven publications were selected for full text reading. The bulk of the literature originated from the orthopaedic discipline, reporting wear debris following knee/hip arthroplasties. The rest comprised osteosynthesis (plates/screws), oral implant/dental materials, dermatology/cardiac-pacemaker, pathology/cancer, biomaterials and general reports. Conclusion: This review of the literature indicates that titanium can induce hypersensitivity in susceptible patients and could play a critical role in implant failure. Furthermore, this review supports the need for long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up of all implant patients who are sensitive to metals. At present, we know little about titanium hypersensitivity, but it cannot be excluded as a reason for implant failure. To cite this article: ?Siddiqi A, Payne AGT, De Silva RK, Duncan WJ.

AB  - Summary Desensitization protocols are being used worldwide to enable kidney transplantation across immunologic barriers, i.e. antibody to donor HLA or ABO antigens, which were once thought to be absolute contraindications to transplantation. Desensitization protocols are also being applied to permit transplantation of HLA mismatched hematopoietic stem cells to patients with antibody to donor HLA, to enhance the opportunity for transplantation of non-renal organs, and to treat antibody-mediated rejection. Although desensitization for organ transplantation carries an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection, ultimately these transplants extend and enhance the quality of life for solid organ recipients, and desensitization that permits transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells is life saving for patients with limited donor options. Complex patient factors and variability in treatment protocols have made it difficult to identify, precisely, the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of donor-specific antibodies. The mechanisms underlying desensitization may differ among the various protocols in use, although there are likely to be some common features. However, it is likely that desensitization achieves a sort of immune detente by first reducing the immunologic barrier and then by creating an environment in which an autoregulatory process restricts the immune response to the allograft.

AB  - Summary This report presents a detailed evaluation of the role of maternal serum sialomucins, determined as seromucoid, in normal pregnancy. These substances effectively block the maternal recognition of fetal antigens in first and possibly second, but not in third or subsequent pregnancies. They act not only at the fetomaternal interface itself, but also at trophoblast deported to the maternal vascular system. It is suggested that maternal sialomucins generate a polyelectrolyte hydrogel at trophoblastic surfaces, and that an immunologically non-specific mechanism which depends on the establishment of stable hydration structures could account for the masking of fetal antigens. Attention is drawn to inverse relationships between serum sialomucin levels and thymolymphatic activity, both during and after pregnancy. These relationships suggest that maternal sensitization to fetal antigens normally occurs after the fourth puerperal week following the first pregnancy, and that a second pregnancy may be necessary to establish full maternal sensitization.

AB  - Summary. Typical features of multiple myeloma (MM) are osteolytic lesions and severely affected bone regeneration. This study of 53 MM patients demonstrates an enhancement of osteoblast cytotoxicity by malignant myeloma cells via the upregulation of apoptogenic receptors, including Fas ligand (Fas-L) and tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). Both were significantly increased in the marrow myeloma cells of patients with extensive osteolytic lesions in a fashion similar to the highly malignant human myeloma cell line MCC-2. Osteoblasts from these subjects over-expressed Fas and death receptor (DR) 4/5 and underwent dramatic apoptosis when co-cultured with either MCC-2 or autologous myeloma cells. In osteoblast and myeloma cell co-cultures, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) mRNA was upregulated in osteoblasts from patients with severe bone disease in parallel with increased CC-chemokine receptor R2 (CCR2) expression, the ligand of MCP-1, in the myeloma cells. This chemokine was shown to activate malignant cell migration in vitro. An upregulation of ICAM-1 expression occurred in osteoblasts from patients with active skeleton disease. This upregulation appeared to be an effect of malignant plasma cell contact, as MCC-2 co-culture greatly enhanced ICAM-1 production by resting osteoblasts from patients without skeleton involvement. Our results suggest that osteoblasts in active myeloma are functionally exhausted and promptly undergo apoptosis in the presence of myeloma cells from patients with severe bone disease. It is suggested that this cytotoxic effect plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of defective bone repair.

AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - With its emphasis on minimally invasive high-speed imaging of intact tissues at depth, video-rate two-photon microscopy has revolutionized cell biology. This is particularly true in immunology, where the orchestration of cell migration, cell?cell interactions and intracellular signalling events in multiple distinct anatomical compartments within secondary lymphoid organs is fundamental for achieving an effective immune response. Until recently, access to this powerful tool has been limited to a handful of laboratories with the necessary skills and resources to either custom-build or purchase a commercial two-photon microscope. However, with the entry of more commercial vendors into the market and availability of turnkey solutions, two-photon microscopy is now becoming more accessible. Here, we discuss the practical aspects of establishing a basic intravital two-photon microscopy facility specifically for immunological research and how recent advances in ultrafast lasers, non-linear optics and localized photochemistry can be used to build more sophisticated instruments to support applications such as photoactivation and photobleaching, spectral fingerprinting and automated single-cell tracking. In addition, we discuss the next generation of fluorescent dyes and reporter mice and some of the microsurgical principles required to expose the relevant biology to interrogation by two-photon excitation.
