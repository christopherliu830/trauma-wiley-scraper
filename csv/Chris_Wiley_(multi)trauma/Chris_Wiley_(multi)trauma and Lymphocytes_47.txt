AB  - With its emphasis on minimally invasive high-speed imaging of intact tissues at depth, video-rate two-photon microscopy has revolutionized cell biology. This is particularly true in immunology, where the orchestration of cell migration, cell?cell interactions and intracellular signalling events in multiple distinct anatomical compartments within secondary lymphoid organs is fundamental for achieving an effective immune response. Until recently, access to this powerful tool has been limited to a handful of laboratories with the necessary skills and resources to either custom-build or purchase a commercial two-photon microscope. However, with the entry of more commercial vendors into the market and availability of turnkey solutions, two-photon microscopy is now becoming more accessible. Here, we discuss the practical aspects of establishing a basic intravital two-photon microscopy facility specifically for immunological research and how recent advances in ultrafast lasers, non-linear optics and localized photochemistry can be used to build more sophisticated instruments to support applications such as photoactivation and photobleaching, spectral fingerprinting and automated single-cell tracking. In addition, we discuss the next generation of fluorescent dyes and reporter mice and some of the microsurgical principles required to expose the relevant biology to interrogation by two-photon excitation.

AB  - Abstract Background? Only a few studies characterized cutaneous non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infections in this region of the world. Objective? The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and histological findings of cutaneous NTM infections in Lebanon. Patients/Methods? Retrospective study of 17 patients (19 histological specimens) diagnosed with cutaneous NTM infections and confirmed by culture-based partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between 2005 and 2008. Results? Of 17 cases, 14 were caused by Mycobacterium marinum. All patients were immunocompetent except for one. Clinically, the most common presentation was multiple sporotrichoid lesions over an extremity (8/17). Many patients had peculiar presentations including bruise-like patches, herpetiform lesions, annular ulcerated plaques, symmetrical nodules over the buttocks and locally disseminated lesions with surrounding pale halo. Almost all patients cleared their infection on either minocycline or clarithromycin monotherapies. Histologically, a dermal small vessel proliferation with mixed inflammation (granulation tissue-like changes) was identified in 58% of specimens. The most common type of granulomatous inflammation was the suppurative (47%) followed by the tuberculoid (30%), sarcoidal (11%), and palisading (5%) types. Lichenoid granulomatous dermatitis was noted in 42% of cases. Special staining highlighted mycobacteria in only two specimens. Conclusions? The incidence of cutaneous NTM infections is high in our area. Many patients had peculiar clinical presentations. Our study is the second to report the common presence of granulation tissue-like changes as a good histological indicator of cutaneous NTM infections. Minocycline and clarithromycin remain the drugs of choice in our area.

AB  - Summary Over-nutrition and its late consequences are a dominant theme in medicine today. In addition to the health hazards brought on by over-nutrition, the medical community has recently accumulated a roster of health benefits with obesity, grouped under ?obesity paradox.? Throughout the world and throughout history until the 20th century, under-nutrition was a dominant evolutionary force. Under-nutrition brings with it a mix of benefits and detriments that are opposite to and continuous with those of over-nutrition. This continuum yields J-shaped or U-shaped curves relating body mass index to mortality. The overweight have an elevated risk of dying in middle age of degenerative diseases while the underweight are at increased risk of premature death from infectious conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies, major concerns of nutritional science in the 20th century, are being neglected. This ?hidden hunger? is now surprisingly prevalent in all weight groups, even among the overweight. Because micronutrient replacement is safe, inexpensive, and predictably effective, it is now an exceptionally attractive target for therapy across the spectrum of weight and age. Nutrition-related conditions worthy of special attention from caregivers include excess vitamin A, excess vitamin D, and deficiency of magnesium.

AB  - Summary Background Facial wrinkles are key signs of aging which affect one's quality of life and psychological well-being. Absorbable wedge-shaped polydioxanone (PDO) sutures are popular in the esthetic clinics of Korea and may be a treatment option for static wrinkles on the upper face. Objective To describe a novel technique applicable to deep static wrinkles on the upper face and to assess its safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on the static wrinkle cases which were treated with folded, wedge-shaped PDO threads. A total of 33 Korean patients with glabellar and forehead wrinkles were included. All participants underwent a single treatment session. The results were assessed objectively using serial photography and subjectively based on the patients' satisfaction scores. Complications were also recorded. Results Our patients displayed moderate (15.2%), severe (39.4%), and very severe (45.4%) static wrinkles at baseline. The majority of patients (81.8%) considered the results satisfactory. Consensus ratings by two independent dermatologists showed that the objective outcomes at 2-month follow-up were very much improved (30.3%), much improved (30.3%), and improved (24.2%). The incidence of complications was low, and the complications were minor. Conclusion Wedge-shaped PDO sutures in a folded configuration (?solid fillers?) are a promising treatment option for deep static wrinkles on the upper face. They may be applied as an adjunct, or as an alternative to conventional therapies such as botulinum toxin and soft tissue filler injection.

AB  - Abstract The Immunodeficiency, Centromeric region instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome (OMIM #242860) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective DNA methylation. Hematological disease and malignancy (macrophage activation syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome, and Hodgkin lymphoma) have been reported in three patients. To date, there have been no reports of either epithelial or mesenchymal malignancies. We present a patient with all clinical and laboratory findings of the ICF syndrome who died of a metastatic angiosarcoma of the liver. This is the first report of a non-hematological malignancy in the ICF syndrome. The young age at which our patient developed an angiosarcoma suggests an effect of the defective DNA methylation observed in the ICF syndrome. Therefore, with improvement of recognition and treatment of the ICF syndrome, malignancy could become more common in this condition. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract microRNAs are functional, 22 nt, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background and Objectives With the number of tattoos increasing, a rising number of complications have also been reported, such as allergic and foreign body reactions or the development of malignant tumors. We discuss 19 patients with alterations in skin tattoos, define clinicopathologic characteristics and give a brief review of the literature. Patients and Methods Biopsy specimens were obtained in 13 of 19 patients. In all cases, staining was performed with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, CD68, CD123, and CD163. The inflammatory infiltrate was classified according to the pattern analysis of Ackerman. Results Three of 19 patients (15.8%) had temporary tattoos with henna and 16 (84.2%) had permanent tattoos. Histologically, among the 13 biopsy specimens we found signs of acute contact dermatitis in 2 (15.3%), lupus-like patterns in 2 (15.3%), foreign body dermatitis in 5 (38.4%), deposition of pigment without inflammation or simple scarring in 2 (15.3%), and tumors in 2 patients (15.2%), 1 of which was a malignant melanoma. Conclusions Clinical presentation frequently, but not always, correlates with the histologic pattern. Obtaining a biopsy can be helpful in determining further investigations, for example allergy testing or a search for systemic involvement in cases of tattoo sarcoidosis.
