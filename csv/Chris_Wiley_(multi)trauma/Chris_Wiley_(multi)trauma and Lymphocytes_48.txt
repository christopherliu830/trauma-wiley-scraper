AB  - Summary Cancer is increasingly important in low and middle-income settings where infectious diseases are declining. Childhood cancers treated in well-resourced centres have excellent outcomes with more than 80% survival. This success is not reflected in low-income settings where challenges involve every step on the care pathway. Access to diagnosis, delayed presentation, advanced disease, co-morbidities and underlying malnutrition make treatment difficult. Treatments are costly for impoverished families. Yet, the common haematological malignancies (Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non Hodgkin lymphoma) are relatively easy to diagnose and, when managed with simple chemotherapy protocols, give limited but good results. As funding becomes available for cancer research we must ensure that the care and cure of these children is top of the agenda. There is already evidence of improved outcomes in middle-income countries. For others there is a long journey ahead.

AB  - Abstract Pigmented orthochromatic leukodystrophy and hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids are two adult onset leukodystrophies with neuroaxonal spheroids presenting with prominent neurobehavioral, cognitive and motor symptoms. These are familial or sporadic disorders characterized by cerebral white matter degeneration including myelin and axonal loss, gliosis, macrophages and axonal spheroids. We report clinical, neuroimaging and pathological correlations of four women ages 34?50 years with adult onset leukodystrophy. Their disease course ranged from 1.5?8 years. Three patients had progressive cognitive and behavioral changes; however, one had acute onset. Neuroimaging revealed white matter abnormalities characterized by symmetric, bilateral, T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense Magnetic Resonance Imaging signal involving frontal lobe white matter in all patients. Extensive laboratory investigations were negative apart from abnormalities in some mitochondrial enzymes and immunologic parameters. Autopsies demonstrated severe leukodystrophy with myelin and axonal loss, axonal spheroids and macrophages with early and severe frontal white matter involvement. The extent and degree of changes outside the frontal lobe appeared to correlate with disease duration. The prominent neurobehavioral deficits and frontal white matter disease provide clinical-pathologic support for association pathways linking distributed neural circuits sub-serving cognition. These observations lend further support to the notion that white matter disease alone can account for dementia.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAU) is the second most common type of ulceration seen in the oral cavity. Notwithstanding an extensive literature and numerous proposed aetiologies, the cause of the disease remains obscure. In addition to the current conservative management of RAU lesions with corticosteroids, new treatment options are available and some have proven successful in open trials. This paper reviews patient work-up and management.

AB  - Summary. Increasing numbers of children are receiving solid organ transplants namely kidney, liver, heart and lung. Patient survival rates following such transplants are essentially good with much of the success attributable to the development of Cyclosporine A (CyA), an immunosuppressive drug, that minimizes organ rejection. However the gingival overgrowth (GO) associated with the use of CyA is not only disfiguring but in paediatric recipients, may interfere with normal oral development and function. Objective. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge concerning the aetiology, pathogenesis and management of gingival overgrowth. Methods. Literature pertaining to gingival overgrowth is reviewed with particular reference to the paediatric population. Emphasis is placed on summarizing the evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of intervention. Conclusion. CyA undoubtedly causes gingival overgrowth, the effects and levels of which appears to be more severe in younger patients. There is conflicting evidence as to the effectiveness of oral hygiene regimes, antibiotics and surgery in reducing overgrowth. The introduction of an alternative immunosuppressive agent (Tacrolimus) offers potential as it does not appear to cause overgrowth, although research to date is limited by the small sample size of many of the studies. This is an area in which multicentre studies would be of great value.

AB  - Abstract Background. Proliferative myositis is a rare, benign, reactive intramuscular lesion of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin; an identical lesion in a subcutaneous or fascial location is referred to as proliferative fasciitis. The rapid growth rate and unusual histopathologic features have frequently been mistaken for a malignant process and have promoted unnecessary invasive procedures. Here we present only the third oral case of proliferative myositis, arising from the tongue of a 65-year-old man. Methods and Results. Histologically, the resected lesion was composed of numerous fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cells and variable numbers of large ganglion-like cells infiltrating between and around muscle fascicles, resembling a ?checkerboard? configuration. A demographic profile of proliferative myositis of the head and neck is also provided, compiled from 19 patients culled from an English-language literature review and this report. Conclusions. Incisional biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy of proliferative myositis of the head and neck should lead to spontaneous resolution and is, therefore, sufficient to render the diagnosis and to provide conservative treatment. Recurrence is extremely rare. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2007

AB  - Summary Genetic defects of platelets constitute rare diseases that include bleeding syndromes of autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked inheritance. They affect platelet production, resulting in a low circulating platelet count and changes in platelet morphology, platelet function, or a combination of both with altered megakaryopoiesis and a defective platelet response. As a result, blood platelets fail to fulfil their haemostatic function. Most studied of the platelet function disorders are deficiencies of glycoprotein mediators of adhesion and aggregation while defects of primary receptors for stimuli include the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Studies on inherited defects of (i) secretion from storage organelles (dense granules, Î±-granules), (ii) the platelet cytoskeleton and (iii) the generation of pro-coagulant activity have identified genes indirectly controlling the functional response. Signalling pathway defects leading to agonist-specific modifications of platelet aggregation are the current target of exome-sequencing strategies. We now review recent advances in the molecular characterization of platelet function defects.

AB  - Abstract An approximately 2-year-old female Doberman Pinscher was referred for the evaluation of bilateral, chronic proliferative conjunctivitis. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral thick, opaque pseudomembranes originating from the conjunctivae that prevented visualization of the cornea and interior structures of the eye. Histopathological findings of biopsies of the pseudomembranes were consistent with ligneous conjunctivitis. Serum plasminogen activity levels were within the normal range. Treatment with topical and systemic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs did not improve the conjunctival lesions. The pseudomembranes were surgically excised, and the conjunctival surfaces were reconstructed with amniotic membrane. At final re-examination two years postsurgery, there was no evidence of recurrence of the pseudomembranes. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of the successful treatment of canine ligneous conjunctivitis with amniotic membrane transplantation.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - As infectious complications from blood transfusion have decreased because of sophisticated blood screening, non-infectious side-effects have emerged as the most common complications of transfusion in industrialized countries. Despite making every endeavour, quite a number of these side-effects are very difficult to control. Some of these side-effects present as acute transfusion reactions, the most important of which are transfusion-related acute lung injury, circulatory overload, sepsis, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Acute adverse events require immediate action, but are often difficult to evaluate. On the other hand, transfusion recipients may experience delayed non-infectious side effects, including, non-ABO haemolytic transfusion reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura. In addition, a not well-defined risk of increased mortality following blood transfusion has been recognized. Some aspects regarding the clinical presentation, the physiology behind, and possible preventive measures are summarized here.

AB  - In comparison to hypotonia, hypertonia is less commonly expressed in the neonatal period. The scientific literature on the causes of neonatal hypertonia is scant, with no suggested diagnostic algorithm easily available to clinicians. Aetiologies include conditions affecting the central nervous system and spine, and rare peripheral neuromuscular disorders leading to hypertonia. Aetiology onset may be antepartum, peripartum with either transient hypertonia or persistent hypertonia which may appear later, or from a postnatal event/disease. This review discusses neonatal hypertonia and a diagnostic approach to neonatal hypertonia is suggested.
