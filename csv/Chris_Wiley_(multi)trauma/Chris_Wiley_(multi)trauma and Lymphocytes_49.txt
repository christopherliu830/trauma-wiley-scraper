AB  - Summary Brucella-exposure and infection is increasingly recognized in marine mammals worldwide. To better understand the epidemiology and health impacts of Brucella spp. in marine mammals of Brazil, molecular (conventional PCR and/or real-time PCR), serological (Rose Bengal Test [RBT], Competitive [c]ELISA, Serum Agglutination Test [SAT]), pathological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or microbiological investigations were conducted in samples of 129 stranded or by-caught marine mammals (orders Cetartiodactyla [n = 124], Carnivora [n = 4] and Sirenia [n = 1]). Previous serological tests performed on available sera of 27 of the 129 animals (26 cetaceans and one manatee), indicated 10 seropositive cetaceans. Conventional PCR and/or real-time PCR performed in cases with available organs (n = 119) and/or blood or swabs (n = 10) revealed 4/129 (3.1%) Brucella-infected cetaceans (one of them with positive serology; the remaining three with no available sera). Pathological, IHC and/or microbiological analyses conducted in PCR/real-time PCR and/or seropositive cases (n = 13) revealed Brucella-type lesions, including meningitis/meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, necrotizing hepatitis, pericarditis and osteoarthritis in some of those animals, and positive IHC was found in all of them (excepting two live-stranded animals without available organs). Brucella spp. culture attempts were unsuccessful. Our results demonstrated exposure, asymptomatic, acute and chronic Brucella sp. infection in several cetacean species in the Brazilian coast, highlighting the role of this pathogen in stranding and/or death, particularly in Clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) and short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) off Ceará State. Novel hosts susceptible to Brucella included the franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). Additionally, three coinfection cases involving Brucella spp. and cetacean morbillivirus, Edwarsiella tarda and Proteus mirabilis were detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term and large-scale survey of Brucella spp. in marine mammals of South America, widening the spectrum of susceptible hosts and geographical distribution range of this agent with zoonotic potential.

AB  - Summary Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiency.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the therapeutic options for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (IMT). Data Sources Original research publications and review articles using the PubMed search engine for the phrases ?immune-mediated thrombocytopenia? or ?immune thrombocytopenic purpura? or ?immune thormbocytopenia.? Veterinary and Human Data Synthesis There are a number of therapeutic options for adult-onset immune thrombocytopenia in human medicine with demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies although corticosteroids and immunoglobulin therapy remain the first-line medical treatments. Thrombopoietin receptor agonist therapy and, to a lesser extent, rituximab have shown great promise in initial clinical trials and may become standard of care in human medicine for the management of IMT. Therapeutic options in veterinary medicine are less diverse and only vincristine and human intravenous immunoglobulin therapies have been evaluated in controlled clinical studies. Conclusions There are a number of therapeutic options in the management of IMT veterinary medicine, most of which have not been investigated in clinical studies. Further research is warranted to best identify the optimal treatment strategy for IMT in veterinary patients.

AB  - Toxicologic pathology is the art of assessment of potential adverse effects at the tissue level in pre-clinical studies. In the case of biomaterials and medical devices, the toxicologic pathologists assess the safety (biocompatibility) and efficacy (conditions of the use) of the implantable materials. Proper assessment of biocompatibility of biomaterials is of utmost importance, since it helps to determine their safety after implantation in humans. Biomaterial-related toxicity can be attributed to several factors, including for example leachable compounds from the material leading to thrombosis or carcinogenesis, or biodegradation of the material causing changes in its physical and compatibility properties. Evaluation of biocompatibility and biofunctionality involves assessment of cytotoxicity, allergic responses, irritation, inflammation and systemic and chronic toxicity. In many of these assessments, the toxicologic pathologist has an important role in determining product safety and potential toxicity. In this article, we review the special needs for proper toxicologic pathology assessment of biomaterials and degradable polymers. We review common adverse effects expected with biomaterials and describe their pathological picture and their clinical relevance. We also introduce a novel compact MR imaging technology as a tool for assessing biocompatibility and efficacy of implanted biodegradable materials, since it allows for the longitudinal imaging and quantification of inflammation in vivo caused by the device implantation, and enabling general inspection of shape, location and integrity of the device in vivo. Since the MR imaging technique is non-invasive, the effects of the implantable device can be monitored longitudinally in the same animal without perturbation of the pathology.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in heart transplantation is to maximize safety and efficacy while minimizing morbidity and mortality. We now have numerous drug combinations, but few have been compared with each other. Aim:? To compare various immunosuppressive regimens assessing morbidity and mortality at one yr. Methods:? A total of 351 patients transplanted between 1989 and 2005 were included and grouped by immunosuppressive regimen into group 1 (n?=?52): Muronomab (OKT3) 10?d, cyclosporine (CSA), azathioprine (AZA), steroids; group 2 (n?=?193): OKT3 seven d, CSA, AZA, steroids; group 3 (n?=?22): OKT3 seven d, CSA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids; and group 4 (n?=?84): interleukin-2 antagonists (IL-2), CSA, MMF, steroids. Results:? The incidence of acute graft failure and treated rejection was similar between groups (17% and 78% respectively). We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections (p?<?0.001), renal dysfunction (p?=?0.011) and in diabetes mellitus (p?=?0.023). There were no differences in survival at 30?d (97%), but differences were found at one yr (p?=?0.011). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association between mortality and infection (p?=?0.001) and between survival and the group 4 regimen (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? There are differences in survival at one yr of heart transplant patients depending on the immunosuppressive regimen used. The best combination was induction with IL-2 antagonists, followed by CSA, MMF and steroids.

AB  - Abstract Tibial plateau fractures are difficult to treat and more likely complicated by subsequent surgical site infection (SSI). There is limited information about its characteristics and related risk factors for SSI. This study was designed as a prospective and multicentre one to address this issue. From July to 15 November in 2014, 235 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and followed up with complete data. Twelve patients (5·1%, 12/235) developed SSI, with 2·1% for deep SSI and 3·0% for superficial SSI. Most of them (10/12) occurred during the hospital stays. The median occurrence time was 6 days after operation (range, 2?26 days). We use univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the potential risk factors. In the univariate analysis, open fracture, prolonged preoperative stay, smoking habitus and preoperative abnormal neutrophil (NEUT) count were significant risk factors for SSI occurrence. However, in multivariate analysis, only open fracture (OR, 3·31; 95%, 1·06?1·84) and current smoking status (OR, 5·68; 95% CI, 1·56?20·66) remained significant. We recommend that smoking cessation programme is introduced at the time of admission to the hospital and elaborative evaluation of fracture severity and soft-tissue damage is performed with an aim of reducing the risk of post-operative SSI.
