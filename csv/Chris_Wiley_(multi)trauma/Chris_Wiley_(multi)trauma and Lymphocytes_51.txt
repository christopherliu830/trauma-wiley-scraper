AB  - Abstract Cytokines are proteins or glycoproteins which are produced by cells and act on other cells that display on their surface specific cytokine receptors. Cytokines are used by cells to communicate. Within a determined sequence, these mediators lead the responding cells to modify their function (e.g., secretion, proliferation, induction, inhibition, enhanced or reduced function, migration, apoptosis). Despite cytokines having mainly been discovered by immunologists as a product of cells of leukocyte lineage, they are now recognized as elements of a universal language used by most cells of any other lineage. Accordingly, they are essential for many events through life, such as reproductive tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, steady-state and adaptive hematopoiesis, surveillance and maintenance of tissue structure, functions of the immune system, inflammation, cell survival, and cell death. Cytokines also allow a dialog with the central nervous system, and some may modify different behaviors (e.g., fever, anorexia, sleep). Cytokines usually act within their vicinity, but they can also act via an endocrine fashion. Their production is tightly controlled within a complex network of positive and negative loops. They are a prerequisite for the control of infection by invasive microorganisms, though their exacerbated production may be deleterious at local or systemic levels. Their ?half-angel/half-devil? aspect has rendered cytokines difficult to use for therapeutic purposes, though some recombinant cytokines or cytokine-neutralizing strategies have been used successfully in different pathological conditions.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a recently introduced option for limb replacement and reconstruction of tissue defects. As with other allografts, CTA can undergo immune-mediated rejection; therefore standardized criteria are required for characterizing and reporting severity and types of rejection. This article documents the conclusions of a symposium on CTA rejection held at the Ninth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology in La-Coru?a, Spain, on 26 June 2007, and proposes a working classification, the Banff CTA-07, for the categorization of CTA rejection. This classification was derived from a consensus discussion session attended by the first authors of three published classification systems, pathologists and researchers from international centers where clinical CTA has been performed. It was open to all attendees to the Banff conference. To the extent possible, the format followed the established National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on Consensus Development Programs. By consensus, the defining features to diagnose acute skin rejection include inflammatory cell infiltration with involvement of epidermis and/or adnexal structures, epithelial apoptosis, dyskeratosis and necrosis. Five grades of severity of rejection are defined. This classification refines proposed schemas, represents international consensus on this topic, and establishes a working collective classification system for CTA reporting of rejection in skin-containing CTAs.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious problem that adversely affects human health, limits longevity and increases costs to health-care systems worldwide. Its increasing incidence cannot be fully explained by traditional risk factors. Oxidative stress is prevalent in CKD patients and is considered to be an important pathogenic mechanism. Oxidative stress develops from an imbalance between free radical production often increased through dysfunctional mitochondria formed with increasing age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammation, and reduced anti-oxidant defences. Perturbations in cellular oxidant handling influence downstream cellular signalling and, in the kidney, promote renal cell apoptosis and senescence, decreased regenerative ability of cells, and fibrosis. These factors have a stochastic deleterious effect on kidney function. The majority of studies investigating anti-oxidant treatments in CKD patients show a reduction in oxidative stress and many show improved renal function. Despite heterogeneity in the oxidative stress levels in the CKD population, there has been little effort to measure patient oxidative stress levels before the use of any anti-oxidants therapies to optimize outcome. This review describes the development of oxidative stress, how it can be measured, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and the molecular pathways that are altered, the role of oxidative stress in CKD pathogenesis and an update on the amelioration of CKD using anti-oxidant therapies.
