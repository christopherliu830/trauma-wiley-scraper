AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a major problem of health in developed countries, with important consequences in disability and health economics. Recent findings in CNS genomics and pharmacogenomics suggest that the introduction of pharmacogenomic procedures in clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics (efficacy and safety issues). The genes involved in the pharmacogenomics of CNS drugs fall into five categories: (i) genes associated with CNS pathogenesis; (ii) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (iii) genes associated with drug metabolism; (iv) genes associated with drug transporters; and (v) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 30?90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Only 20?30% of the Caucasian population processes normally approximately 60% of the current drugs that are metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Clinical pharmacogenomics may contribute to personalizing pharmacological treatment, predicting patient/drug-dose selection, minimizing drug interactions, increasing drug efficacy, and reducing unnecessary costs.

AB  - Summary The two general groups for tumors of the hemolymphatic system are lymphoid (lymphoma and leukemia) and myeloid leukemias. The tumors in each can be characterized by their anatomic distribution in the body, histologic distribution within hemolymphatic organs, morphology of cells, immunophenotype, cytopenias, and, when known, their biologic behavior and molecular characteristics. Lymphoblastic tumors are some of the most aggressive neoplasms in veterinary medicine with survival times measured in weeks to months. Lymphomas arise in lymphoid tissues outside of the bone marrow and leukemias arise in bone marrow or spleen. Classification of lymphomas has progressed through criteria largely related to cytological characteristics (Kiel) to one based on distinct diseases encompassing the total information related to that neoplasm. The Kiel and WHO/REAL classifications use multiple parameters to subdivide lymphomas into many diagnoses. Molecular techniques complement these classifications and additionally further subdivide lymphomas and leukemias, demonstrating how heterogeneous phenotypically similar tumors are.

AB  - Summary Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an important dermatologic autoimmune disease. In many respects, it may be regarded as a model autoimmune disease due to its spectrum of autoimmune antibodies and involvement of different organ systems, as well as response to immunosuppressive agents which target B cells and T cells and their cytokines. A recently published article in this Journal summarized the most important knowledge about epidemiology, genetics, and immunology of LE. Here, the different clinical manifestations, diagnostic procedures and current therapeutic approaches will be described. Special emphasis is placed on different cutaneous manifestations of LE. In regard to treatment, the classic treatment approaches such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be described. Lastly, new therapeutic approaches with specific monoclonal antibodies which are currently used in systemic LE, such as belimumab (Benlysta?), will be addressed. The most recent developments in this area could have implications even for purely cutaneous forms of LE.

AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Reconstruction of the tongue with existing methods of tissue transfer often leaves glossectomy patients with significant deficits in speech and swallowing. The critical role of the tongue is implied by its unique structure and function. This paper reports the development of an animal model of hemitongue allotransplantation and documents functional and anatomic outcomes of this procedure. Methods: Ten pairs of unmatched dogs underwent reciprocal exchange of the left hemitongue with microneurovascular replantation. The unoperated hemitongue acted as the control. Under cyclosporine immunosuppression, animals surviving long term underwent clinical observation, before electromyography, force transduction studies, and histological evaluation being euthanized. Results: Five animals survived between 6 and 13 months for long-term evaluation. The remaining group were euthanized because of or died of overwhelming infection or uncontrollable transplant rejection. The latter sometimes resulted from difficulty in the delivery of the cyclosporine. Clinical recovery of tongue function was observed, as well as resumption of motor unit potential activity on electromyography. Contractile force recovery of the transplanted tongue averaged 68% of control (range, 47%-97%), and histological study of the hypoglossal and lingual nerves demonstrated anatomic evidence of reinnervation. Preservation of muscle, mucosal, and stromal ultrastructure was seen with light microscopy of the transplanted tongue. Conclusions: Allotransplantation of the hemitongue and associated neurovascular apparatus is possible in a large mammalian model, with long-term survival of tissue being accompanied by partial recovery of contractile properties. Anatomical and clinical evidence also points to sensory recovery. These data support the future possibility of employing a similar technique in glossectomy patients.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are soluble proteins produced by leukocytes and other cell types, which act as chemical communicators between cells and tissues within the body. These proteins mediate a number of functions, ranging from effects on cell growth, differentiation, survival, and a number of effector activities. The main purpose of this unit is to provide an easy-to-use reference summarizing some of the current information on well-established cytokine, growth factore, and chemokine ligands. The information provided is confined largely to alternative names, protein properties, genetic chracteristics, chromosomal localization, cellular expression patters, cellular-tissue targets, stimuli regulating expression, functional properties, expression analysis, and clinical utility.

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.
