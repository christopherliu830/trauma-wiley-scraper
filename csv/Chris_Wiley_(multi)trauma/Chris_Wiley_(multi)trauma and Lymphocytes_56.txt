AB  - Abstract Introduction: Reconstruction of the tongue with existing methods of tissue transfer often leaves glossectomy patients with significant deficits in speech and swallowing. The critical role of the tongue is implied by its unique structure and function. This paper reports the development of an animal model of hemitongue allotransplantation and documents functional and anatomic outcomes of this procedure. Methods: Ten pairs of unmatched dogs underwent reciprocal exchange of the left hemitongue with microneurovascular replantation. The unoperated hemitongue acted as the control. Under cyclosporine immunosuppression, animals surviving long term underwent clinical observation, before electromyography, force transduction studies, and histological evaluation being euthanized. Results: Five animals survived between 6 and 13 months for long-term evaluation. The remaining group were euthanized because of or died of overwhelming infection or uncontrollable transplant rejection. The latter sometimes resulted from difficulty in the delivery of the cyclosporine. Clinical recovery of tongue function was observed, as well as resumption of motor unit potential activity on electromyography. Contractile force recovery of the transplanted tongue averaged 68% of control (range, 47%-97%), and histological study of the hypoglossal and lingual nerves demonstrated anatomic evidence of reinnervation. Preservation of muscle, mucosal, and stromal ultrastructure was seen with light microscopy of the transplanted tongue. Conclusions: Allotransplantation of the hemitongue and associated neurovascular apparatus is possible in a large mammalian model, with long-term survival of tissue being accompanied by partial recovery of contractile properties. Anatomical and clinical evidence also points to sensory recovery. These data support the future possibility of employing a similar technique in glossectomy patients.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Summary: The T-helper 17 (Th17) lineage is a recently described subset of memory T cells that is characterized by its CD4+ status and its ability to make a constellation of cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. Although most extensively described in the autoimmunity literature, there is growing evidence that the Th17 lineage plays a significant role in mediating host mucosal immunity to a number of pulmonary pathogens. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of the Th17 lineage and Th17 cytokines in mediating mucosal immunity to both pulmonary and gastrointestinal pathogens. While we have the strongest evidence that the Th17 lineage is centrally involved in mediating the host response to Gram-negative extracellular pulmonary pathogens, this literature is rapidly evolving and demonstrates a central role for Th17 cytokines both in primary infection and in recall responses seen in vaccine studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of this literature and present possible applications of Th17-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infection.

AB  - Abstract The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves both genetic-susceptibility and, at least, three sequential environmental-events. The first environmental-event is a maternal-factor, which acts near birth. The second acts subsequently but prior to approximately age 15 years and the third acts long after these first two events have already taken place. Two environmental-events strongly implicated in MS-pathogenesis are vitamin D deficiency and Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection. These factors seem well-suited to the first two environmental-events in this causal chain. If this notion is correct, it is likely that interrupting either of these factors (e.g. the timely supplementation of Vitamin D or the development of an EBV vaccine might be simple and effective methods for achieving primary disease prevention. In addition to these environmental-events, genetic factors are both crucial and complex. More than 110 genomic-regions have now been associated with MS-susceptibility and only a very small fraction of the population is genetically-susceptible. However, the actual genes involved are much more poorly defined than is often thought. For example, it turns out that the well-established association with the DRB1*1501 allele on chromosome 6, is, likely, not due to this allele itself but, rather, to something else that resides on the SNP-haplotype, which usually harbors this allele. Also, despite women being the large majority of MS patients, men are more likely to be genetically-susceptible. Nevertheless, women are more responsive to the changing environmental-exposures, which have occurred recently; thereby accounting for the changes in sex-ratio and MS-prevalence in women, which have been found in many regions.
