AB  - Abstract Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are endogenous bioactive lipids that participate in the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. These processes are each critical for successful embryogenesis, raising the possibility that lysophospholipid signaling may contribute to normal animal development. In fact, recent studies in developmental model systems have established that S1P and LPA are necessary for diverse developmental programs including those required for morphogenesis of vertebrate reproductive, cardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), as well as the establishment of maternal-fetal circulation and the immune system. Genetic, morphological, and biochemical characterization of developmental model systems offer powerful approaches to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of lysophospholipid signaling and its contributions to animal development and postnatal physiology. In this review, the routes of S1P and LPA metabolism and our current understanding of lysophospholipid-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells will be summarized. The evidence implicating lysophospholipid signaling in the development of specific vertebrate systems will then be reviewed, with an emphasis on signals mediated through G protein-coupled receptors of the Edg family. Lastly, recent insights derived from the study of simple metazoan models and implications regarding lysophospholipid signaling in organisms in which Edg receptors are not conserved will be explored. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Recent clinical trials have challenged the concept that aggressive full feeding as close to goal requirements as possible is necessary in the first week following admission to the intensive care unit. While the data suggesting that permissive underfeeding is better than full feeds are methodologically flawed, other data do indicate that in certain well-defined patient populations, outcomes may be similar. The most important issues for clinicians in determining optimal nutrition therapy for critically ill patients are to carefully determine nutrition risk and differentiate nutrition from nonnutrition benefits of early enteral feeding. Management decisions in the first week of hospitalization should be made in the context of both short- and long-term outcomes. Patients at highest nutrition risk may require advancement to goal feeds as soon as tolerated to maximize benefit from nutrition therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a fatal thrombohemorrhagic disorder. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have tremendous therapeutic effect. Our aim was to explore whether the immune mechanisms were associated with BMSCs-afforded protection against DIC. We generated a rat model of DIC by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3?mg/kg) injection via the tail vein. In the treatment group, rats were pre-treated with 1???l03, 1???l04, 1???l05, and 1???l06 allogeneic BMSCs before LPS injection. Blood sample was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta at 0 (before), 4, and 8?h after LPS injection and used for biochemical analyses. After experiments, the mice were sacrificed and their organs were harvested and observed by H&E and PTAH staining. Continuous infusion of LPS into the rats gradually impaired the hemostatic parameters and damaged organ functions. However, pre-treatment with BMSCs dose-dependently improved the hemostatic parameters. Meanwhile, the treatment significantly suppressed the fibrin microthrombi formation and alleviated liver, heart, lung, and renal injuries. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that BMSCs pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of CD3+CD8+ T cells and CD3+/CD161a+ NKT cells in the peripheral blood. BMSCs pre-treatment reversed the upregualtion of the B-cell population and the percentage of CD43+/CD172a+ monocytes in the DIC models. Finally, BMSCs pre-treatment decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-? (IFN-?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in LPS-induced DIC models. Pre-treatment with BMSCs can reduce coagulation and alleviate organ dysfunction via peripheral immune responses in LPS-induced DIC rat model. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

Oral lichen planus and dental hygiene: a case report. Abstract:? Background:? The presence of atrophic-erosive lesions among gingival tissues makes oral hygiene procedures difficult for several reasons. Plaque control and rigorous oral hygiene are a fundamental requisite for the treatment of any oromucosal disease. Case report:? A patient suffering from a mixed atrophic-erosive form of oral lichen planus (OLP), with serious gingival involvement, was also treated with the topical application of clobetasol propionate 0.05% using gingival trays. The highest hygiene standards of both patient and trays were of fundamental importance. Discussion:? The management of the patient suffering from gingival atrophic-erosive OLP requires the synergic treatment of both dentist and dental hygienist, whose contribution supports the corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive treatment.
