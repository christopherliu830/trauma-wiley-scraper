AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

AB  - Abstract Background/Objectives The aim of the present study was to investigate treatment modalities and outcomes in oral mucosal melanoma. Methods The clinical and pathological data of 38 consecutive patients with oral mucosal melanoma were retrospectively analyzed. Patients' characteristics were analyzed and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated. Results Sixteen patients had stage III (42%), 19 IVA (50%), and three had stage IVC (8%) disease. Among the therapeutic approaches used, 31 patients (82%) received radical therapy (surgery +/? chemotherapy). The 5-year OS rate was 40%. Five-year OS rates according to the clinical stage were 71% for stage III, 24% for stage IVA, and 0% for stage IVC. Five-year OS rates according to therapeutic approaches were 52% in the radical therapy group and 0% in the palliative therapy and best supportive care groups. Conclusions The results of this multicentre retrospective analysis of patients with oral mucosal melanoma suggest that radical therapy based on surgical treatments with complete surgical excision with clear margins leads to a better prognosis.

AB  - Methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone is an effective preservative and a major cause of cosmetic allergy in most European countries. On the face unusual clinical presentations are seborrhoeic dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, lymphocytic infiltrate, photodermatosis or atopic dermatitis. Three patients who suffered a chronic, recurrent, itchy and generalized cutaneous erytematous-desquamative and eczematous eruption with a common pathologic event, an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, whose induction by a contact allergen can be discussed are presented. The first, a 59 years old man showed a biopsy with an atypical dermal-epidermal T cell infiltrate of mycosis fungoides and monoclonal TCR-rearrangement. The second, a 74 years old man showed an atypical lymphoid infiltration with polyclonal TCR-rearrangement and a second biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. The third, a 50 year old man with pathology of plaque parapsoriasis with atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The three patients showed strong positive reaction to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone (0.01%aq.) Trolab,,?. Avoiding the allergen the cutaneous eruption disappeared and any recurrence has been observed yet. Pathologic criteria for mycosis fungoides remains controversial and could not be done only on the basis of cellular density or the percentage of atypical T-cells. Autoinvolutive mycosis fungoides shows the unknowledge of its pathogenesis. How some allergens could affect on the cellular life needs further studies. We highly recommend to patch test all patients with atypical cutaneous T-cell infiltrates.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Keratosis lichenoides chronica (KLC) is a rare chronic disorder of keratinization, characterized by the progressive development of erythematosquamous plaques and violaceous lichenoid hyperkeratotic papules, nodules and ridges. These lesions are most commonly found in a symmetrical distribution on the trunk and extremities and display a unique linear and/or reticulate pattern. The etiology of KLC remains unknown and the eruptions tend to be refractory to treatment. We describe a case of keratosis lichenoides chronica that improved with systemic retinoids.

AB  - Richter syndrome (RS) is associated with chemotherapy resistance and a poor historical median overall survival (OS) of 8?10 months. We conducted a phase II trial of standard CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone every 21 d) with ofatumumab induction (Cycle 1: 300 mg day 1, 1000 mg day 8, 1000 mg day 15; Cycles 2?6: 1000 mg day 1) (CHOP-O) followed by 12 months ofatumumab maintenance (1000 mg given 8-weekly for up to six cycles). Forty-three patients were recruited of whom 37 were evaluable. Seventy-three per cent were aged >60 years. Over half of the patients received a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide-based regimen as prior CLL treatment. The overall response rate was 46% (complete response 27%, partial response 19%) at six cycles. The median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4·9?14·0 months) and median OS was 11·4 months (95% CI 6·4?25·6 months). Treatment-naïve and TP53-intact patients had improved outcomes. Fifteen episodes of neutropenic fever and 46 non-neutropenic infections were observed. There were no treatment-related deaths. Seven patients received platinum-containing salvage at progression, with only one patient obtaining an adequate response to proceed to allogeneic transplantation. CHOP-O with ofatumumab maintenance provides minimal benefit beyond CHOP plus rutuximab. Standard immunochemotherapy for RS remains wholly inadequate for unselected RS. Multinational trials incorporating novel agents are urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an inflammatory destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-1 (IL-1), have been suggested to be effector molecules based on the observations that pro-inflammatory cytokines cause beta-cell apoptosis in vitro and aggravate diabetes in vivo, and that inhibition of the action of these cytokines reduce diabetes incidence in animal models of type 1 diabetes and islet graft destruction. This review presents the rationale for and design of a recently launched double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial that investigates the effect of interleukin-1 antagonism on beta-cell function in subjects with T1D of recent-onset.

AB  - Tattoos are becoming increasingly popular, although reactions to tattoos remain relatively uncommon. We describe 4 patients with a variety of red tattoo reactions, one responding well to intralesional steroid therapy. Case 1:? A 50-year-old man presented with a florid, inflammatory reaction confined to the red area of his forearm tattoo. Biopsy showed a dense lymphocytic and focal macrophage response to tattoo pigment. Mass spectrometry of biopsy tissue revealed high concentrations of titanium and iron. Patch testing was negative. Intralesional steroid injection has produced a marked improvement. Case 2:? A 42-year-old man presented with an inflammatory reaction affecting the red area of his leg tattoo. Biopsy revealed a florid lymphoid reaction. Case 3:? A 30-year-old man presented with an eczematous reaction within the red/brown pigmented areas of his tattoos, which was exacerbated by sun exposure. Patch testing showed a (+) positive reaction to cadmium after 96 hours. Photo patch testing was negative. The reaction settled spontaneously within 12 months. Case 4:? A 37-year-old woman presented with a florid, indurated inflammatory reaction involving the red area of a shoulder tattoo. Patch testing revealed a (++) and (+) positive reaction to nickel and cobalt respectively with a doubtful (?+) reaction to mercury 0.5% in petrolatum after 96 hours. Tattoo reactions, especially red tattoo reactions can present with a spectrum of histological changes, including lichenoid, granulomatous, hypersensitivity, nodular, pseudolymphomatous or sarcoidal reactions. One of our cases responded well to intralesional steroid injection and one case resolved spontaneously.

AB  - Summary:? We present the case of a patient whose semen contained 30% of sperm with double heads and double tails at various stages of attachment due to abnormal meiosis. The genital system, sperm density, endocrinological profile and karyotype were normal. It is postulated that abundance of the above-noted type of sperm pathology in the human semen might not necessarily be associated with oligozoospermia or fertility impairment. Hohes Ausmaß von Doppelkopf- und Doppelschwanz-Spermatozoen im Sperma eines Mannes. Fallbericht Zusammenfassung:? Bericht über einen 33jährigen Mann, der kinderlos verheiratet ist und bei dem 30% der Spermatozoen doppelte Köpfe und doppelte Schwanzstrukturen aufwiesen. Der Genitalbefund, die Spermatozoendichte, das endokrinologische Profil und der Karyotyp waren normal. Es wird festgestellt, daß das übermäßige Auftreten der ge-nannten Spermatozoen-Abnormitäten im Ejakulat nicht unbedingt mit einer Oligozoosper-mie oder einer Beeinträchtigung der Fertilität verbunden sein muß.
