AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.

AB  - Sarcoidosis is known to be involved in diseases with vasculitis as sarcoid vasculitis. However, vasculitis in cutaneous sarcoidal lesions is extremely rare. Here we describe a case of sarcoidosis with multiple annular skin lesions with granulomatous vasculitis. A 62-year-old female was diagnosed with sarcoidosis by chest-abdominal computed tomographic examination and laboratory tests. The skin lesions had appeared on her lower limbs 2?years before. Physical examination showed multiple infiltrated annular eruptions on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy of an area of erythema showed multiple non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis and subcutaneous fat and granulomatous vasculitis with fibrinoid degeneration in the subcutaneous fat. There are two types of vasculitis in sarcoidosis: leukocytoclastic and granulomatous vasculitis. Ulcers and livedo were more common in granulomatous vasculitis than in leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The present case had unique annular skin lesions of sarcoidosis with granulomatous vasculitis.

AB  - Summary The extracellular forms of the IL-1 cytokines are active through binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells. IL-1 ligands bind to the extracellular portion of their ligand-binding receptor chain. For signaling to take place, a non-binding accessory chain is recruited into a heterotrimeric complex. The intracellular approximation of the Toll-IL-1-receptor (TIR) domains of the 2 receptor chains is the event that initiates signaling. The family of IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) includes 10 structurally related members, and the distantly related soluble protein IL-18BP that acts as inhibitor of the cytokine IL-18. Over the years the receptors of the IL-1 family have been known with many different names, with significant confusion. Thus, we will use here a recently proposed unifying nomenclature. The family includes several ligand-binding chains (IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1R4, IL-1R5, and IL-1R6), 2 types of accessory chains (IL-1R3, IL-1R7), molecules that act as inhibitors of signaling (IL-1R2, IL-1R8, IL-18BP), and 2 orphan receptors (IL-1R9, IL-1R10). In this review, we will examine how the receptors of the IL-1 family regulate the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions of the IL-1 cytokines and are, more at large, involved in modulating defensive and pathological innate immunity and inflammation. Regulation of the IL-1/IL-1R system in the brain will be also described, as an example of the peculiarities of organ-specific modulation of inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Fas ligation via the ligand FasL activates the caspase-8/caspase-3-dependent extrinsic death pathway. In so-called type II cells, an additional mechanism involving tBid-mediated caspase-9 activation is required to efficiently trigger cell death. Other pathways linking FasL?Fas interaction to activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway remain unknown. However, ATP release and subsequent activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) favors cell death in some cells. Here, we evaluated the possibility that ATP release downstream of caspase-8 via pannexin1 hemichannels (Panx1 HCs) and subsequent activation of P2X7Rs participate in FasL-stimulated cell death. Indeed, upon FasL stimulation, ATP was released from Jurkat cells in a time- and caspase-8-dependent manner. Fas and Panx1 HCs colocalized and inhibition of the latter, but not connexin hemichannels, reduced FasL-induced ATP release. Extracellular apyrase, which hydrolyzes ATP, reduced FasL-induced death. Also, oxidized-ATP or Brilliant Blue G, two P2X7R blockers, reduced FasL-induced caspase-9 activation and cell death. These results represent the first evidence indicating that the two death receptors, Fas and P2X7R connect functionally via caspase-8 and Panx1 HC-mediated ATP release to promote caspase-9/caspase-3-dependent cell death in lymphoid cells. Thus, a hitherto unsuspected route was uncovered connecting the extrinsic to the intrinsic pathway to amplify death signals emanating from the Fas receptor in type II cells. J. Cell.

AB  - SUMMARY It is widely accepted that immune tolerance toward ?self? is established by central and peripheral adaptations of the immune system. Mechanisms that have been demonstrated to play a role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance include thymic deletion of self-reactive T cells, peripheral T cell anergy and apoptosis, as well as thymic and peripheral induction of regulatory T cells. However, a large body of experimental findings cannot be rationalized solely based on adaptations of the immune system to its environment. Here we propose a new model termed Ecoimmunity, where the immune system and the tissue are viewed as two sides of a continuously active and co-evolving predator?prey system. Ecoimmunity views self-tolerance, not as an equilibrium in which autoimmunity is chronically suppressed, but as a symmetrical balanced conflict between the ability of immune cells to destroy tissue cells by numerous mechanisms, and the capacity of adapted tissue cells to avoid predation. This balance evolves during ontogeny, in parallel to immune adaptations, embryonic tissue cells adapt their phenotype to the corresponding immune activity by developing the ability to escape or modulate damaging local immune responses. This phenotypic plasticity of tissue cells is directed by epigenetic selection of gene expression pattern and cellular phenotype amidst an ongoing immune pressure. Thus, whereas some immune cells prey predominantly on pathogens and infected cells, self-reactive cells continuously prey on incompetent tissue cells that fail to express the adapted phenotype and resist predation. This model uses ecological generalization to reconcile current contradictory observations as well as classical enigmas related to both autoimmunity and to tolerance toward foreign tissues. Finally, it provides empirical predictions and alternative strategies toward clinical challenges.

AB  - Abstract Miniaturized microneedle devices are being developed for painlessly targeting vaccines to the immune cell populations in skin. As skin immunization studies are generally restricted to animal models however, where skin architecture and immunity is greatly different to human, surprisingly little is known about the local human response to intradermal (ID) vaccines. Here surgically excised human skin is used to explore for the first time the complex molecular and cellular host responses to a candidate influenza vaccine comprising nanoparticulate virus-like-particles (VLPs), administered via conventional hypodermic injection or reduced scale microneedles. Responses at the molecular level are determined by microarray analysis (47,296 discrete transcripts) and validated by quantitative PCR (96 genes). Cellular response is probed through monitoring migration of dendritic cells in viable skin tissue. Gene expression mapping, ontological analysis, and qPCR reveal up-regulation of a host of genes responsible for key immunomodulatory processes and host viral response, including cell recruitment, activation, migration, and T cell interaction following both ID and microneedle injection of VLPs; the response from the microneedles being more subtle. Significant morphological and migratory changes to skin dendritic cells are also apparent following microneedle VLP delivery. This is the first study displaying the global, multifaceted immunological events that occur at the site of vaccine deposition in human skin and will subsequently influence the degree and nature of innate and adaptive immune responses. An increased understanding of the detailed similarities and differences in response against antigen administered via different delivery modalities will inform the development of improved vaccines and vaccine delivery systems.

AB  - Abstract An 80-yr-old female with a grade I diffuse goiter was diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration cytology as having Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Two years later, she developed a hard nodular growth in the right lobe of the thyroid, which was subjected to fine-needle aspiration and diagnosed as a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunocytology demonstrated the monoclonal B cell nature of the lesion. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and is alive and free of the disease 27 mo after surgery.
