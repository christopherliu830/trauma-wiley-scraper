AB  - A 9-year-old, female neutered Dalmatian was evaluated for acute onset of dyspnoea. Thoracocentesis on presentation yielded 1300 ml sanguineous fluid, while thoracic radiology and ultrasonography showed a mixed-echoic cavitary cranial mediastinal mass, sternal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. Surgical exploration of the thorax revealed a multi-lobulated red/brown cranial mediastinal mass and multiple similarly coloured ovoid nodules within several lung lobes. Histopathology revealed thymic branchial cysts with neoplastic transformation and examination of the lung was consistent with metastasis. Despite initially recovering well, acute sepsis and pyothorax resulted in cardiac arrest 8 days postoperatively. This is the first veterinary report of neoplastic transformation of a thymic branchial cyst with pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript constitutes a review of several innovative biomedical technologies fabricated using the precision and accuracy of silicon micro- and nanofabrication. The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.

AB  - Oestrus ovis L. (Diptera: Oestridae) is a cosmopolitan agent of myiasis in sheep and goats. The parasitic phase begins after adult females deposit first-stage larvae (L1) into the nostrils of hosts; these larvae develop into L2 and L3 in the nasal and sinus horn cavities. Sneezing and nasal discharges are the major clinical signs in infected animals. The pathogenesis of O. ovis infection is caused by: (a) the trauma resulting from the mechanical action of spines and hooks during larval movement on mucosal membranes, and, more importantly, (b) an allergenic reaction provoked by molecules excreted/secreted by larvae, of which salivary antigens are those mainly recognized by the host's immune system. The recruitment of immune reactive cells increases gradually from the nasal to sinus cavities in infected hosts. Mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes are always more numerous in infected than non-infected animals. Humoral (antibody) systemic response of immunoglobulin G (IgG) usually reaches seroconversion 2?4 weeks post-first infection and the highest levels are observed during the development of L2 and L3 larvae. Local antibody responses include specific IgG, which has been found to negatively correlate with larval survival and development. Hypersensitivity reaction, immunomodulation, immunization trials and mixed infections of O. ovis and helminths are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis often causes functional impairment due to tissue destruction. This report demonstrates a novel previously unappreciated role of osteoblasts. Samples of osteomyelitic bone and bacterially challenged osteoblasts produce increased amounts of antimicrobial peptides in order to combat bacterial bone infection. An osteomyelitis mouse model confirmed the osseous induction of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, suggesting a central role in the prevention of bacterial bone infection. Antimicrobial peptides are effectors of the innate defence system and play a key role in host protection at cellular surfaces. Some of them are produced constitutively, whereas others are induced during infection. Human ?-defensins represent a major subclass of antimicrobial peptides and act as a first line of defence through their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present in-vitro and in-vivo investigations was to study the expression and regulation of human ?-defensin-2 in the case of bacterial bone infection and to analyse the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone-derived antimicrobial peptide expression. Samples of healthy human bone, osteomyelitic bone and cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cells) were assessed for the expression of human ?-defensin-2. Regulation of human ?-defensin-2 was studied in hFOB cells after exposure to bacterial supernatants, proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An osteomyelitis mouse model was performed to demonstrate the regulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, named murine ?-defensin-3, by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Healthy human bone and cultured osteoblasts are able to produce human ?-defensin-2 under standard conditions. Samples of infected bone produce higher levels of endogenous antibiotics, such as human ?-defensin-2, when compared with samples of healthy bone. A clear induction of human ?-defensin-2 was observed after exposure of cultured osteoblasts to Gram-positive bacteria or proinflammatory cytokines. Additional treatment with glucocorticoids or methotrexate prevented bacteria-mediated antimicrobial peptide induction in cultured osteoblasts. The osteomyelitis mouse model demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, namely murine ?-defensin-3, in bone after intraosseous contamination of the tibia. Human and murine bone have the ability to produce broad-spectrum endogenous antibiotics when challenged by micro-organisms in vitro and in vivo. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids or methotrexate, may increase the susceptibility to bone infection by decreasing antimicrobial peptide expression levels in case of microbial challenge. The induction of human ?-defensin-2 following bacterial contact suggests a central role of antimicrobial peptides in the prevention of bacterial bone infection.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Summary Background Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) are life-threatening infections most commonly diagnosed in acute leukaemia patients with prolonged neutropenia and are uncommonly diagnosed in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. Objectives Following the initial report of aspergillosis diagnosed shortly after beginning ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a survey was developed to seek additional cases of IFD during ibrutinib treatment. Methods Local and international physicians and groups were approached for relevant cases. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma; proven or probable IFD; and ibrutinib treatment on the date IFD were diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data were captured using REDCap software. Result Thirty-five patients with IFD were reported from 22 centres in eight countries: 26 (74%) had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment before the onset of IFD was 45 days (range 1-540). Aspergillus species were identified in 22 (63%) of the patients and Cryptococcus species in 9 (26%). Pulmonary involvement occurred in 69% of patients, cranial in 60% and disseminated disease in 60%. A definite diagnosis was made in 21 patients (69%), and the mortality rate was 69%. Data from Israel regarding ibrutinib treated patients were used to evaluate a prevalence of 2.4% IFD. Conclusions The prevalence of IFD among chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with ibrutinib appears to be higher than expected. These patients often present with unusual clinical features. Mortality from IFD in this study was high, indicating that additional studies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk for ibrutinib-associated IFD.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of horses with lymphoma are often nonspecific and dependent on the organ system affected. At the present time, the prognosis for all forms of equine lymphoma is grave, but palliative therapies including surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are available and have been reported with varying degrees of success to improve quality of life and prolong survival time. Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with equine lymphoma are uncommon, and are thought to be the result of soluble polypeptide hormones secreted by tumor cells. Definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be obtained antemortem through identification of neoplastic lymphocytes in tissues, fluids, aspirates, or peripheral blood. Response to chemotherapy is highly variable, with some horses displaying dramatic improvement within 2-4 months of initiating induction protocols and remaining in remission for several months, while others show only modest or no response, regardless of treatment protocol.

AB  - Summary Despite a worldwide need to expand the lung donor pool, approximately 75% of lung offers are not accepted for transplantation. We investigated the impact of liberalizing lung donor acceptance criteria during the last decade on the number of effective transplants and early and late outcomes in our center. All 514 consecutive lung transplants (LTx) performed between Jan 2000 and Oct 2011 were included. Donors were classified as matching standard criteria (SCD; n = 159) or extended criteria (ECD; n = 272) in case they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: age >55 years, PaO2/FiO2 at PEEP 5 cmH2O < 300 mmHg at time of offer, presence of abnormalities on chest X-ray, smoking history, presence of aspiration, presence of chest trauma, or donation after circulatory death. Outcome parameters were primary graft dysfunction (PGD) grade at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after LTx, time to extubation, stay in intensive care unit (ICU), early and late infection, acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and survival. Two hundred and seventy-two recipients (63.1%) received ECD lungs. PGD grade at T0 was similar between groups, while at T12 (<0.01), T24 (<0.01), and T48 (<0.05), PGD3 was observed more often in ECDs. ICU stay (P < 0.05) was longer in ECDs compared with SCDs. Time to extubation, respiratory infections, acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, BOS, and survival were not different between groups. Accepting ECDs contributed in increasing the number of lung transplants performed in our center. Although this lung donor strategy has an impact on early postoperative outcome, liberalizing criteria did not influence long-term outcome after LTx.

AB  - Abstract When a patient receiving anti-cancer treatment presents acutely unwell, an understanding of associated side effects of their therapy is critical. This review will discuss the approach to patients receiving anti-cancer treatment with immunotherapy presenting with autoimmune toxicities in the emergency setting. These toxicities are commonly referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAE). IrAE might consist of, but are not limited to, dermatologic, gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, colitis), hepatic, endocrine (thyroid dysfunction, hypophysitis, adrenal crisis), renal, ocular and pulmonary toxicity. General principles of managing these irAE in the acute setting will be outlined. Steroid therapy is a critical component of the treatment algorithm, being administered at high doses and for prolonged periods to switch off immune over-activation. Prompt intervention might prevent multi-organ failure and fatality, and allow patients to remain on effective anti-cancer therapy.

AB  - Abstract Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) plays an important role in the gastric mucosal defense mechanism and also acts as a functional gastric tumor suppressor. In this study, we examined the effect of GKN1 on the expression of inflammatory mediators, including NF-?B, COX-2, and cytokines in GKN1-transfected AGS cells and shGKN1-transfected HFE-145 cells. Lymphocyte migration and cell viability were also analyzed after treatment with GKN1 and inflammatory cytokines in AGS cells by transwell chemotaxis and an MTT assay, respectively. In GKN1-transfected AGS cells, we observed inactivation and reduced expression of NF-?B and COX-2, whereas shGKN1-transfected HFE-145 cells showed activation and increased expression of NF-?B and COX-2. GKN1 expression induced production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-8 and -17A, but decreased expression of IL-6 and -10. We also found IL-17A expression in 9 (13.6%) out of 166 gastric cancer tissues and its expression was closely associated with GKN1 expression. GKN1 also acted as a chemoattractant for the migration of Jurkat T cells and peripheral B lymphocytes in the transwell assay. In addition, GKN1 significantly reduced cell viability in both AGS and HFE-145 cells. These data suggest that the GKN1 gene may inhibit progression of gastric epithelial cells to cancer cells by regulating NF-?B signaling pathway and cytokine expression. J. Cell.

AB  - CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of ten variant exons (v1-v10). Standard CD44 (CD44s) is the cell-surface receptor for hyaluronate and is involved in lymphocyte homing and activation. The function of the variant CD44 isoforms (CD44v) is unknown. Recently we observed an altered expression of CD44s and CD44v in different inflammatory skin diseases. In cutaneous lichen planus (LP) CD44s and CD44v are expressed in the epidermis whereas dermal lymphocytes express strongly CD44s and weakly CD44v3 and are negative for CD44v. In this study we examined the expression of CD44s and CD44v (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10) in active oral LP lesions by immunohistochemistry. CD44s was highly expressed by keratinocytes and dermal lymphocytes. Epithelial expression of CD44v4, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10 was decreased or absent. Biopsies did not contain CD44v3, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10-positive lymphocytes. Lymphocyte expression of CD44v4, CD44v5 and CD44v6 was observed. Unlike CD44v4 and CD44v5, CD44v6 was expressed by large quantities of lymphocytes. Our results show that the expression of CD44v in oral LP is different from cutaneous LP, which suggests that differential expression of CD44v may play a role in the generation of LP in different locations.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - Summary Background Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Studies have implicated the immune response, especially monocyte/macrophages as being important in dictating outcome. Aim To investigate changes in the circulating monocytes and other immune cells serially in patients with ALF, relate these with cytokine concentrations, monocyte gene expression and patient outcome. Methods In a prospective case?control study in the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, 35 consecutive patients admitted with paracetamol-induced liver failure (POD-ALF), 10 patients with non-paracetamol causes of ALF and 16 controls were recruited. The peripheral blood monocyte phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry, circulating cytokines quantified by protein array and monocyte gene expression array performed and related to outcome. Results On admission, patients with worst outcomes after POD-ALF had a significant monocytopenia, characterised by reduced classical and expanded intermediate monocyte population. This was associated with reduced circulating lymphocytes and natural killer cells, peripheral cytokine patterns suggestive of a ?cytokine storm? and increased concentrations of cytokines associated with monocyte egress from the bone marrow. Gene expression array did not differentiate patient outcome. At day 4, there was no significant difference in monocyte, lymphocyte or natural killer cells between survivors and the patients with adverse outcomes. Conclusions Severe paracetamol liver failure is associated with profound changes in the peripheral blood compartment, particularly in monocytes, related with worse outcomes. This is not seen in patients with non-paracetamol-induced liver failure. Significant monocytopenia on admission may allow earlier clarification of prognosis, and it highlights a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Summary Aims The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of induction therapy using the interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (IL-2RA) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) under a tacrolimus-based immunosuppression regimen in kidney transplantation from donors after cardiac death. Methods It was a single-centre, retrospective, cohort study design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-2RA vs. ATG induction therapy in adult renal transplant recipients from donors after cardiac death. The primary end-point was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 6 months, and the secondary end-point included the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), the renal function, and the patient and graft survival at 6 months. The safety end-point was the incidence of infectious complications. Results A total of 132 patients (n = 37 in the IL-2RA group and n = 95 in the ATG group) were enrolled from March 2013 to April 2014. The BPAR at 6 months was similar between the two groups (IL-2RA vs. the ATG group, 5.4% vs. 12.6%, respectively, p = 0.228). There were no differences in the DGF, renal function at 1 and 3 months, and the patient and graft survival at 6 months between the two groups, but the renal function at 6 months in the IL-2RA group was superior to that of the ATG group (p = 0.02). The IL-2RA group experienced less infection than the ATG group (p = 0.025). Conclusions The efficacy of IL2-RA and ATG induction under a tacrolimus-based immunosuppression regimen in low-risk DCD transplantation did not differ, but the safety of the IL2-RA induction was better than that of the ATG induction.

AB  - An 11-year-old male Belgian shepherd dog was evaluated for a one-week history of progressive lethargy, decreased appetite and excessive panting. On physical examination, a pedunculated mass protruding from the right side of the tongue base was observed. The mass was solid, irregular and multi-lobulated, and it measured approximately 4?2 cm. The mass was surgically excised. The histological examination was consistent with a lingual osteoma and the margins were free of neoplastic cells. The dog was euthanased eight months after the diagnosis because of an unrelated problem and no evidence of recurrence at the surgical site was appreciated at that time. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of a lingual osteoma in a dog, and, therefore, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of masses on the tongue, especially pedunculated masses located at the base of the tongue.

AB  - Abstract Laser-induced thermal effects in optically trapped microspheres and single cells are investigated by quantum dot luminescence thermometry. Thermal spectroscopy has revealed a non-localized temperature distribution around the trap that extends over tens of micrometers, in agreement with previous theoretical models besides identifying water absorption as the most important heating source. The experimental results of thermal loading at a variety of wavelengths reveal that an optimum trapping wavelength exists for biological applications close to 820 nm. This is corroborated by a simultaneous analysis of the spectral dependence of cellular heating and damage in human lymphocytes during optical trapping. This quantum dot luminescence thermometry demonstrates that optical trapping with 820 nm laser radiation produces minimum intracellular heating, well below the cytotoxic level (43 °C), thus, avoiding cell damage.

AB  - Summary Thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is necessary in order to open new avenues for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize the CD4+ T cell population and evaluate their activation and polarization status in OA joints. Fifty-five patients with end-stage knee OA (Kellgren?Lawrence grades III?IV) who underwent surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were enrolled into this study. Matched samples of synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were analysed for CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets [T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells] and activation status (CD25, CD69, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD62L) by flow cytometry. Subset-specific cytokines were analysed by cytometric bead array (CBA). SM and SF samples showed a distinct infiltration pattern of CD4+ T cells. In comparison to PB, a higher amount of joint-derived T cells was polarized into CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets, with the most significant increase for proinflammatory Th1 cells in SF. CBA analysis revealed significantly increased immunomodulating cytokines [interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10] in SF compared to PB. Whereas in PB only a small proportion of CD4+ T cells were activated, the majority of joint-derived CD4+ T cells can be characterized as activated effector memory cells (CD69+CD45RO+CD62L?). End-stage OA knees are characterized by an increased CD4+ T cell polarization towards activated Th1 cells and cytokine secretion compared to PB. This local inflammation may contribute to disease aggravation and eventually perpetuate the disease process.

AB  - Objective To investigate the ability of shape memory Dacron polymer vascular coils to induce the complete, gradual occlusion of the canine jugular vein. Study Design Observational pilot study. Animals Nine purpose-bred dogs. Methods Eighteen coils were deployed in nine dogs using fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous transvenous coil implantation. Individual coil formulations varied around a Dacron polymer base. Jugular vein diameter, percent vessel occlusion, and thrombus echogenicity were monitored at weekly intervals using ultrasonography. Affected jugular veins were harvested at 6 weeks post-implantation and histopathological analysis was performed to assess adventitial fibrosis, intimal layer thickening, and inflammation. Results Ten coils migrated from the jugular veins to the pulmonary vasculature within 0?2 weeks following implantation. Three jugular veins achieved at least 90% occlusion at six weeks. Histopathology of these jugular veins revealed marked perivascular thickening and fibrovascular proliferation, increased infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, and abundant fibroplasia. Conclusions Complete, gradual occlusion of a jugular vein was achieved in three dogs. Significant vessel wall reaction and inflammation can induce gradual vessel occlusion when a Dacron coil remains implanted within the jugular vein. Dacron polymer coils could be a feasible treatment option for the gradual occlusion of congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs using minimally invasive, percutaneous transvenous implantation.

AB  - Objective? To describe inflammatory polyps of the middle ear in 5 dogs. Study Design? Case series. Animals? Five dogs with ear disease. Methods? Medical records (1995?2001) were reviewed to identify dogs with inflammatory polyps of the middle ear. Signalment, clinical signs, ancillary diagnostic procedures, treatment, postoperative complications, and outcome were recorded. Owners and referring veterinarians were contacted to document outcome. Results? Dogs with inflammatory polyps of the middle ear were male and aged 4 to 13 years. Two dogs had bilateral polyps, whereas 3 had unilateral polyps. The most common clinical presentation was otitis externa and media, with radiographic evidence of otitis media. Polyps were treated by ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO) in 1 dog and total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) in 4 dogs. Polyps consisted of a fibrovascular stroma infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The overlying epithelium was frequently ulcerated. Immediate postoperative complications included a seroma after VBO (1 dog) and transient unilateral facial nerve paralysis after bilateral TECA-LBO (1 dog). No recurrence occurred within 9 to 69 months. Conclusions? Unilateral or bilateral, inflammatory polyps can occur in the middle ear of dogs in association with otitis externa and media. No recurrence occurred after surgical removal of the polyps. Clinical Relevance? Inflammatory polyps of the middle ear in dogs can be a cause of otitis externa/media. Surgical removal of aural polyps has a good prognosis.
