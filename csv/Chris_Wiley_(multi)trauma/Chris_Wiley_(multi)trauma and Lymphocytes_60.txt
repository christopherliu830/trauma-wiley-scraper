AB  - Abstract An 80-yr-old female with a grade I diffuse goiter was diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration cytology as having Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Two years later, she developed a hard nodular growth in the right lobe of the thyroid, which was subjected to fine-needle aspiration and diagnosed as a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunocytology demonstrated the monoclonal B cell nature of the lesion. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and is alive and free of the disease 27 mo after surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background Residual disease (RD) is an important prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Flow cytometry (FC)-based RD detection is easy to perform, but interpretation requires expert analysis due to individual differences among patients. Procedure We focused at the design of standardized and reproducible RD monitoring in ALL. RD was investigated by a uniform gating strategy, which was designed internationally and tested in one center by Ig/TCR rearrangements. Results For each gate, positivity cutoff value was assigned using quantification of non-leukemic background. Comparing to Ig/TCR at 0.1% level, 80 of 103 specimens were correctly diagnosed by FC. The predictive value of FC RD at day 15 was then analyzed. In B lineage ALL, day 15 FC significantly correlated with Ig/TCR results at day 33 and/or week 12 (P?<?0.01). No significant correlation was found in T lineage ALL. Conclusions Thus, FC with preset uniform gating at day 15 predicts PCR-detectable MRD in B precursor ALL. Presented data may be used to define new polychromatic cytometric diagnostics of MRD including semiautomatic assessment. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2010; 54:62?70. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The authors reviewed 77 published reports available before August 1, 2005 that examined the ability of hematopoietic cells to generate hepatocytes in the liver. A list of these publications and a synopsis of each are available on-line. We interpret the evidence provided by this data set to suggest that one or more types of hematopoietic cells may rarely acquire the hepatocyte phenotype in the liver (frequency ≤10?4), although the nature of the hematopoietic cells involved and the mechanisms responsible for acquisition of a hepatocyte phenotype are still controversial. Hematopoietic stem cells do not appear to be direct precursors of hepatocytes, which, instead, can be generated from cells of the macrophage?monocyte lineage. Fusion between hepatocytes and transplanted hematopoietic cells has been substantiated as a mechanism by which hepatocytes that carry a bone marrow tag are generated, but direct transdifferentiation of hematopoietic cells has not been demonstrated. In conclusion, hematopoietic cells contribute little to hepatocyte formation under either physiological or pathological conditions, although they may provide cytokines and growth factors that promote hepatocyte functions by paracrine mechanisms. Cells of the endodermal hepatocyte lineage are far more potent generators of hepatocytes than are hematopoietic cells. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;43:2?8.)

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 69?79 Abstract Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The non-specific nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic challenge and concise case definitions are essential for its satisfactory management. Lyme borreliosis is very similar in Europe and North America but the greater variety of genospecies in Europe leads to some important differences in clinical presentation. These new case definitions for European Lyme borreliosis emphasise recognition of clinical manifestations supported by relevant laboratory criteria and may be used in a clinical setting and also for epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Abstract Translocation of wildlife as a means of reintroducing or reinforcing threatened populations is an important conservation tool but carries health risks for the translocated animals and their progeny, as well as wildlife, domestic animals and humans in the release area. Disease risk analyses (DRA) are used to identify, prioritize and design mitigation strategies to address these threats. Here, we use a DRA undertaken for Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) to illustrate how specific methodology can optimize mitigation strategy design. A literature review identified a total of 98 infectious hazards and 28 non-infectious hazards. Separate analyses were undertaken for disease risks in leopards from hazards of source origin (captive zoo collections and the transit pathway to the Russian Far East), or of destination origin (in breeding enclosures and wider release areas); and for disease risks in other wildlife, domesticated species or humans, similarly from hazards of source or destination origin. Hazards were assessed and ranked as priority 1, priority 2, priority 3 or low priority in each of the defined scenarios. In addition, we undertook a generic assessment of stress on individual leopards. We use three examples to illustrate the process: Chlamydophila felis, canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). We found that many potentially expensive screening procedures could be performed prior to export of leopards, putting the onus of responsibility onto the zoo sector, for which access to diagnostic testing facilities is likely to be optimal. We discuss how our methods highlighted significant data gaps relating to pathogen prevalence in the Russian Far East and likely future unpredictability, in particular with respect to CDV. There was emphasis at all stages on record keeping, meticulous planning, design, staff training and enclosure management, which are relatively financially inexpensive. Actions to minimize stress featured at all time points in the strategy and also focussed on planning, design and management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate bladder tissue reactions to three types of implanted mesh material, i.e. polypropylene, polyglactin and polypropylene-polyglactin combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight adult female Wistar albino rats were randomized to four equal groups, i.e. group 1 (sham-operated controls), group 2 (polypropylene mesh), group 3 (polyglactin mesh) and group 4 (polypropylene-polyglactin mesh). A laparotomy incision was made to access the bladder and fix a 0.5???1?cm piece of mesh directly on the bladder wall. Each group was randomly divided into two subgroups of six animals, killed at 7 and 14?days after mesh implantation, respectively, to study mesh and tissue features with time. Bladders were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical investigation. Microvessels that developed around the mesh were detected with the avidin-biotin peroxidase system, using antibody to Factor VIII-related antigen as an endothelial marker. Vessels were counted in the most intensely stained area of one section from each animal's bladder. RESULTS Compared with the other groups, group 4 had more inflammatory reaction at 7?days but the tissue reactions to all mesh materials were similar at 14?days; the mesh penetrated the bladder muscularis propria at 14 days in all six rats in group 2, in one in group 3, and two in group 4. Group 4 tended to have a greater microvessel density at 14 than at 7 days. In contrast, groups 2 and 3 had lower microvessel densities at 14 than at 7 days. CONCLUSION The rat bladder wall had a similar early response to all three types of mesh materials. Penetration was more marked with polypropylene mesh than with the other materials. This nonabsorbable material persists in tissue and is currently widely used for clinical applications. These results for penetration suggest that the use of polypropylene mesh risks serious postoperative complications, e.g. urethral tissue erosion.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation of the pancreas has many presentations in children and adolescents. The etiology is often elusive, with a great number of cases being idiopathic. However, there have been a number of recent advances in the areas of cell biology, genetics and imaging technology, which should be highlighted. Herein is provided a review for the reader with particular emphasis on some of these newer advances.
