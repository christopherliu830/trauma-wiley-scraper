AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate bladder tissue reactions to three types of implanted mesh material, i.e. polypropylene, polyglactin and polypropylene-polyglactin combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight adult female Wistar albino rats were randomized to four equal groups, i.e. group 1 (sham-operated controls), group 2 (polypropylene mesh), group 3 (polyglactin mesh) and group 4 (polypropylene-polyglactin mesh). A laparotomy incision was made to access the bladder and fix a 0.5???1?cm piece of mesh directly on the bladder wall. Each group was randomly divided into two subgroups of six animals, killed at 7 and 14?days after mesh implantation, respectively, to study mesh and tissue features with time. Bladders were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical investigation. Microvessels that developed around the mesh were detected with the avidin-biotin peroxidase system, using antibody to Factor VIII-related antigen as an endothelial marker. Vessels were counted in the most intensely stained area of one section from each animal's bladder. RESULTS Compared with the other groups, group 4 had more inflammatory reaction at 7?days but the tissue reactions to all mesh materials were similar at 14?days; the mesh penetrated the bladder muscularis propria at 14 days in all six rats in group 2, in one in group 3, and two in group 4. Group 4 tended to have a greater microvessel density at 14 than at 7 days. In contrast, groups 2 and 3 had lower microvessel densities at 14 than at 7 days. CONCLUSION The rat bladder wall had a similar early response to all three types of mesh materials. Penetration was more marked with polypropylene mesh than with the other materials. This nonabsorbable material persists in tissue and is currently widely used for clinical applications. These results for penetration suggest that the use of polypropylene mesh risks serious postoperative complications, e.g. urethral tissue erosion.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is the umbrella term for a group of rare inherited skin fragility disorders caused by mutations in at least 20 different genes. There is no cure for any of the subtypes of EB resulting from different mutations, and current therapy only focuses on the management of wounds and pain. Novel effective therapeutic approaches are therefore urgently required. Strategies include gene-, protein- and cell-based therapies. This review discusses molecular procedures currently under investigation at the EB House Austria, a designated Centre of Expertise implemented in the European Reference Network for Rare and Undiagnosed Skin Diseases. Current clinical research activities at the EB House Austria include newly developed candidate substances that have emerged out of our translational research initiatives as well as already commercially available medications that are applied in off-licensed indications. Squamous cell carcinoma is the major cause of death in severe forms of EB. We are evaluating immunotherapy using an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody as a palliative treatment option for locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin unresponsive to previous systemic therapy. In addition, we are evaluating topical calcipotriol and topical diacerein as potential agents to improve the healing of skin wounds in EBS patients. Finally, the review will highlight the recent advancements of gene therapy development for EB.

AB  - Abstract Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, cis 6, cis 9, cis 12-octadecatrienoic acid) is a conditionally essential fatty acid of the n-6 family. It is produced in the mammalian body from enzymatic desaturation of linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid that must be supplied by the diet. It is widely distributed in plant kingdom in trace amounts, and is not present in major commercial vegetable seed oils. It is present in seeds of many species belonging to families Aceraceae, Boraginaceae, Cannabinaceae, Liliaceae, Onagraceae, Ranunculaceae, Saxifragaceae, and Scrophulariaceae. A very limited number of plant sources have been commercialized in last 30 years as a source of GLA, mainly in the health food industry and to a limited extent in pharmaceutical, pet food, and cosmetic industries. These include oils of borage, black currant, evening primrose, and recently hemp. The total market for GLA-containing oils is about $60?$70 million per year. Research on GLA in last three decades has focused on the physiological and pharmacological effects, including its effects on second messenger system in the body. On the production side, research focus is on identification of new sources and yield optimization. This article reviews the current state of knowledge about sources, and nutritional and health benefits of GLA and attempts to identify areas for future research that will help develop markets for GLA.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes are involved in multiple brain functions in physiological conditions, participating in neuronal development, synaptic activity and homeostatic control of the extracellular environment. They also actively participate in the processes triggered by brain injuries, aimed at limiting and repairing brain damages. Purines may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of numerous acute and chronic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes are the main source of cerebral purines. They release either adenine-based purines, e.g. adenosine and adenosine triphosphate, or guanine-based purines, e.g. guanosine and guanosine triphosphate, in physiological conditions and release even more of these purines in pathological conditions. Astrocytes express several receptor subtypes of P1 and P2 types for adenine-based purines. Receptors for guanine-based purines are being characterised. Specific ecto-enzymes such as nucleotidases, adenosine deaminase and, likely, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, metabolise both adenine- and guanine-based purines after release from astrocytes. This regulates the effects of nucleotides and nucleosides by reducing their interaction with specific membrane binding sites. Adenine-based nucleotides stimulate astrocyte proliferation by a P2-mediated increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and isoprenylated proteins. Adenosine also, via A2 receptors, may stimulate astrocyte proliferation, but mostly, via A1 and/or A3 receptors, inhibits astrocyte proliferation, thus controlling the excessive reactive astrogliosis triggered by P2 receptors. The activation of A1 receptors also stimulates astrocytes to produce trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor, S100? protein and transforming growth factor ?, which contribute to protect neurons against injuries. Guanosine stimulates the output of adenine-based purines from astrocytes and in addition it directly triggers these cells to proliferate and to produce large amount of neuroprotective factors. These data indicate that adenine- and guanine-based purines released in large amounts from injured or dying cells of CNS may act as signals to initiate brain repair mechanisms widely involving astrocytes.
