AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from a self-destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (N = 5) and healthy subjects (N = 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.

AB  - AbstractBackground: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) report greater stress and negative health consequences than nonabused women. Although an association between psychological stress and altered immune function has been shown, IPV studies have not investigated this relationship. Objective: This study explored the association of IPV with mental health symptoms and an immune marker to determine if posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms mediate the effect of IPV on pro-inflammatory (IFN-?) cytokine levels. Methods: A cross-sectional, comparative design was used to compare 62 women with IPV and 39 nonabused women. Results: Mean IFN-? values were higher in abused women and in women with current PTSD symptoms. There were no significant relationships with potential confounding variables that could provide an alternative explanation for the increase in production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms mediate the association between IPV and IFN-? levels and may partially explain the association of mental health symptoms with physical health sequelae in IPV.

AB  - Cancer remains a peculiarly stubborn disease to treat. Some forms of cancer have seen tremendous advances in the effectiveness of their treatments, whereas other forms have remained resistant to pharmacological control. This lack of hope for success is in part due to the types of drugs that are used in the clinic, and the targeted biological system being based purely on cellular growth rates. However, recent drugs designed to affect specific signalling pathways or proteins have been showing much success. Thanks to the ingenuity of pharmacologists in understanding and targeting these processes, there have been real improvements in treatment. Here we are presented with some of the research into such critical systems that have to be understood, so that they can be conquered. We will also look at the challenges facing cancer pharmacologists and what the field may present to us all in the future.

AB  - Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely well equipped antigen (Ag)-presenting cells. Their classic function was thought to be that of potent initiators of innate and adaptive immunity to infectious organisms and other Ags (including transplanted organs). Evidence has emerged, however, that DCs have a central and crucial role in determining the fate of immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance. This dichotomous function of DCs, coupled with their remarkable plasticity, renders them attractive therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In transplantation, much recent work has focused on the ability of DCs to silence immune reactivity in an Ag-specific manner in the hope of preventing rejection and diminishing reliance on potentially harmful immunosuppressive agents. Experimental strategies have included in vivo targeting of DCs, as well as ex vivo generation of regulatory (or tolerogenic) DCs with subsequent reinfusion (i.e. cell therapy). Different approaches to ?program? DC toward tolerogenic properties include genetic (transgene insertion), biologic (differential culture conditions, anti-inflammatory cytokine exposure) and pharmacologic manipulation. Recent data suggest a promising role for pharmacologic treatment as a means of generating potent regulatory DCs and have further stimulated speculation regarding their potential clinical application. Herein, we discuss evidence that the potential of regulatory DC therapy is considerable and that there are compelling reasons to evaluate it in the setting of organ transplantation in the near future.
