AB  - Cancer remains a peculiarly stubborn disease to treat. Some forms of cancer have seen tremendous advances in the effectiveness of their treatments, whereas other forms have remained resistant to pharmacological control. This lack of hope for success is in part due to the types of drugs that are used in the clinic, and the targeted biological system being based purely on cellular growth rates. However, recent drugs designed to affect specific signalling pathways or proteins have been showing much success. Thanks to the ingenuity of pharmacologists in understanding and targeting these processes, there have been real improvements in treatment. Here we are presented with some of the research into such critical systems that have to be understood, so that they can be conquered. We will also look at the challenges facing cancer pharmacologists and what the field may present to us all in the future.

AB  - Disruption of axonal transport may represent a final common pathway leading to neurological dysfunction in cerebral malaria (CM). Calpains are calcium (Ca2+)-activated cysteine proteases which have been implicated in axonal injury in neurological diseases of various aetiologies. In this study we examined the association between µ- and m-calpain, the specific inhibitor calpastatin, and axonal injury in post mortem brain tissue from patients who died from severe malaria. Calpains were associated with axons labelled for the ?-amyloid precursor protein that detects impaired axonal transport. Elevated levels of calpastatin were rarely observed in injured axons. There were increased numbers of neurones with µ-calpain in the nuclear compartment in severe malaria cases compared with non-neurological controls, and increased numbers of glia with nuclear µ-calpain in CM patients compared with non-CM malaria cases and non-neurological controls. There was marked redistribution of calpastatin in the sequestered Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Responses specific to malaria infection were ascertained following analysis of brain samples from fatal cases with acute axonal injury, HIV encephalitis, and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. Our findings implicate a role for calpains in the modulation of disease progression in CM.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically since at least the 1950s, and during this timeframe there has been a major increase in the use of blood transfusions, invasive surgical procedures and anesthesia, all of which can impact immune function. We evaluated these factors with NHL risk in a population-based study of 759 cases and 589 frequency-matched controls. Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for the matching factors. History of transfusion was associated with a 26% higher risk of NHL (95% CI 0.91?1.73), and the elevated risk was specific to transfusions first given 5?29 years before the reference date (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.08?2.62) and transfusions given for a medical condition (OR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.03?4.26). The total number of surgeries and dental procedures (OR = 1.53 for 26+ surgeries compared to 0?6; 95% CI 1.02?2.29) and to a lesser extent the total number of exposures to general or local/regional anesthesia (OR = 1.35 for 24+ times compared to 0?6; 95% CI 0.91?2.02) were positively associated with risk of NHL. Inclusion of transfusion and surgery or transfusion and anesthesia in the same model did not attenuate these associations. All results were broadly consistent for both DLBCL and follicular subtypes. Blood transfusions were associated with NHL risk, but appear to be a marker for underlying medical conditions. Multiple surgical procedures and/or repeated administration of anesthesia have not been previously reported to be associated with risk of NHL and these exposures warrant further evaluation.

AB  - Abstract Background Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in Singapore and can present as localized or disseminated disease. Methods Demographic data, clinical features, investigation results, treatments, and outcomes in patients aged <16 years diagnosed with melioidosis at KK Women's and Children's Hospital between January 2002 and January 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Data for patients with primary skin disease and those with other organ involvement were compared. Results Seventeen children were diagnosed with melioidosis. Their median age was 12.5 years (range: 2?15 years). Nine (53%) patients presented with localized cutaneous melioidosis and five (29%) with localized lymphadenitis, pneumonia, or septic arthritis. The remaining three (18%) patients had melioidosis sepsis; two of these patients died from septic shock. Treatment included an initial 1?2 weeks of IV antibiotics followed by 3?6 months of oral combination antibiotics. All cases of localized cutaneous disease resolved completely with no recurrences. Three (60%) of the five patients with localized involvement of other organ systems achieved complete resolution of disease, and the remaining two were lost from follow-up. Conclusions Although uncommon, melioidosis can occur in children living in endemic regions. Patients with localized skin disease have good outcomes with no recurrences. Systemic disease can be fatal, especially in the presence of underlying immunodeficiency. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, and treatment requires prolonged combination antibiotic therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To alert emergency veterinarians of a life-threatening soft tissue infection, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) that mimics non life-threatening cellulitis. In this report, the rapid clinical progression, systemic effects produced by NF, and its successful treatment in a dog is described. Case Summary: A 2-year-old, male, castrated Doberman Pinscher was presented for lameness. Clinical and laboratory findings suggested sepsis. Rapid progression of the infection, as well as surgical and histopathological findings were characteristic for necrotizing fasciitis of a pelvic limb caused by ?-hemolytic streptococcus infection. Aggressive supportive care included intravascular fluid therapy, intravenous antibiotics, plasma transfusions, nutritional support, as well as repeated surgical debridement and drainage. Mid-femoral limb amputation was required to halt the progression of the necrotizing fasciitis. New Information Provided: This is the first detailed description of successful treatment of necrotizing fasciitis caused by ?-Hemolytic streptococcus in the dog.

AB  - Abstract Cell communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been defined for many years and it is not limited only to neighboring cells, but also distant ones in organisms receive these signals. These vesicles are secreted from the variety of cells and are composed of a distinctive component such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. EVs have different classified subgroups regarding their cell origin, in this context, exosomes are the most appealing particles in cell biology, especially clinical in recent years and are represented as novel therapeutic agents with numerous advantages alongside and/or over cell therapy. However, cell therapy had a hopeful outcome in gastrointestinal diseases which have minimal alternatives in their treatments. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal cancers are the examples that cell therapy and immunotherapy were applied in their treatment, therefore, the cell products like exosomes are the beneficial option in their treatment even cancers with promising results in animal models. In this review, we consider the main defined biogenesis, function, and component of secreted exosomes in different cells with a specific focus on the potential application of these exosomes as a cell-free therapeutic approach in gastrointestinal diseases like IBD, gastric cancer, and colon cancer. Additionally, exosomes role as therapeutic reagents mainly mesenchymal stem cells and dendritic cell-derived exosomes in different studies have been under intense investigation and even they are being studied in different clinical trials. Therefore, all these striking functions described for secretome implies the importance of these biocarriers.
