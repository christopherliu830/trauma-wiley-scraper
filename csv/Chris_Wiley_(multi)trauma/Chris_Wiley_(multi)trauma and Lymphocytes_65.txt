AB  - ABSTRACT Over the last four decades, bioarchaeology has experienced significant technical growth and theoretical maturation. Early 21st century bioarchaeology may also be enhanced from a renewed engagement with the concept of biological stress. New insights on biological stress and disease can be gained from cross-disciplinary perspectives regarding human skeletal variation and disease. First, pathophysiologic and molecular signaling mechanisms can provide more precise understandings regarding formation of pathological phenotypes in bone. Using periosteal new bone formation as an example, various mechanisms and pathways are explored in which new bone can be formed under conditions of biological stress, particularly in bone microenvironments that involve inflammatory changes. Second, insights from human biology are examined regarding some epigenetic factors and disease etiology. While epigenetic effects on stress and disease outcomes appear profoundly influential, they are mostly invisible in skeletal tissue. However, some indirect and downstream effects, such as the developmental origins of adult health outcomes, may be partially observable in bioarchaeological data. Emerging perspectives from the human microbiome are also considered. Microbiomics involves a remarkable potential to understand ancient biology, disease, and stress. Third, tools from epidemiology are examined that may aid bioarchaeologists to better cope with some of the inherent limitations of skeletal samples to better measure and quantify the expressions of skeletal stress markers. Such cross-disciplinary synergisms hopefully will promote more complete understandings of health and stress in bioarchaeological science.

AB  - Abstract Peri-implantitis is an infection of the tissue around an implant, resulting in the loss of supporting bone. Risk factors for peri-implantitis consist of a history of periodontitis, dental plaque, poor oral hygiene, smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes. A clinical diagnosis indicates inflammatory signs including bleeding on probing with or without suppuration and a peri-implant pocket depth ≥5?mm. A radiograph shows images of marginal bone loss ≥2?mm. A differential diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, occlusal overload, retrograde peri-implantitis and inflammatory implant periapical lesions suggests the appropriate treatment in each case. The non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, including a mechanical treatment alone or combined with antiseptics or antibiotics can improve clinical parameters in the short term but residual defects may still persist. Surgical treatment such as guided bone regeneration results in a gain of clinical attachment level and bone reconstruction in the long term. The limited effect of laser-assisted therapy needs to be further evaluated. The concept of prevention based on early detection and regular maintenance plays a principal role in reducing the occurrence of peri-implantitis.

AB  - Summary Inflammation is an overall protective response and can be defined as a cellular and non specific immune response to irritation, injury, or infection leading to the local accumulation of leukocytes and fluid. In intensive farming conditions, fish are usually transported, sorted, vaccinated and subjected to stressful handling procedures which may potentially lead to local inflammation and affect the integrity of the spine. The present mini-review aims to introduce the reader in the field of spinal deformities in salmon, propose inflammation as a risk factor for spinal deformities and emphasize the need for conducting further research in the area having an integrated and multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

AB  - Abstract Introduction BK virus (BKV) infection is an important cause of kidney transplant dysfunction. A possible association of double-J ureteral stent placement and BK viremia has been suggested in previous studies; however, risk factors for BK are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine if stent placement is an independent risk factor for BK viremia. Methods Data were collected on consecutive kidney-only transplant recipients between December 1, 2006 and June 30, 2010. All patients had at least 12 months of follow-up. Results Of 600 consecutive kidney transplants, BK viremia within the first post-transplant year was detected in 93 patients (15.5%); in 70 of these cases, the peak BKV polymerase chain reaction was ≥10,000 copies/mL. By multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for BK viremia were recipient age (P = 0.02) and stent placement (P = 0.03). Stents were placed in 49.2% and removed at a median of 46 days (range: 11?284) post transplantation; removals occurred within 0?30, 30?60, 60?90, 90?120, 120?150, and >150 days post transplantation in 18.4%, 67.2%, 10.5%, 2.4%, 1.0%, and 0.3% of cases, respectively. No association was found of BK viremia with stent duration >46 days (P = 0.70) or by the 6-level groupings (P = 0.92). Conclusions Although we observed a significant association of BK viremia with stent placement, no dose-dependent effect was seen.

AB  - Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) using superpulsed near-infrared light can penetrate deeper in the injured tissue and could allow non-pharmacological treatment for chronic wound healing. This study investigated the effects of superpulsed laser (Ga-As 904 nm, 200 ns pulse width; 100 Hz; 0.7 mW mean output power; 0.4 mW/cm2 average irradiance; 0.2 J/cm2 total fluence) on the healing of burn wounds in rats, and further explored the probable associated mechanisms of action. Irradiated group exhibited enhanced DNA, total protein, hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents compared to the control and silver sulfadiazine (reference care) treated groups. LLLT exhibited decreased TNF-α level and NF-kB, and up-regulated protein levels of VEGF, FGFR-1, HSP-60, HSP-90, HIF-1α and matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 compared to the controls. In conclusion, LLLT using superpulsed 904 nm laser reduced the inflammatory response and was able to enhance cellular proliferation, collagen deposition and wound contraction in the repair process of burn wounds. Photomicrographs showing no, absence inflammation and faster wound contraction in LLLT superpulsed (904 nm) laser treated burn wounds as compared to the non-irradiated control and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) ointment (reference care) treated wounds

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.
