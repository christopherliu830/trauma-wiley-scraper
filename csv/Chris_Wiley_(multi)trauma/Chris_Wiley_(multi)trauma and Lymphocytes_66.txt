AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

AB  - Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic and poly-aetiological autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies to autologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. The defective clearance of apoptotic material, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), provides abundant chromatin or self-dsDNA to trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In SLE patients, the immune complex (IC) of dsDNA and its autoantibodies trigger the robust type I interferon (IFN-I) production through intracellular DNA sensors, which drives the adaptive immune system to break down self-tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the potential resources of self-dsDNA, the mechanisms of self-dsDNA-mediated inflammation through various DNA sensors and its functions in SLE pathogenesis.

AB  - Overproduction of interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis (MG), and thymectomy can cause myasthenic crisis because of surgically induced overproduction of IL-6. Preoperative steroid therapy is beneficial in preventing MG crisis during the perioperative period. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of preoperative steroid therapy on proinflammatory mediators during the perioperative period of transsternal thymectomy for MG. The study group comprised 20 consecutive MG patients undergoing transsternal thymectomy during the period March 2002 through March 2004. Seventeen of these patients received dose-escalated steroid therapy before thymectomy (steroid treatment group) and three did not (non-steroid treatment group). Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 were determined during the perioperative period; clinical outcomes were reviewed, and the results were compared between the two groups. Peak serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in the steroid treatment group than in the non-steroid treatment group. Amongst perioperative variables subjected to multiple regression analysis, preoperative steroid treatment were found to be the most significant independent predictor of inhibited IL-6 production on postoperative day 1. No postoperative respiratory failure occurred in the steroid treatment group, but it did occur in the non-steroid treatment group. Preoperative steroid therapy can ameliorate IL-6 overproduction and may help stabilize the patient's postoperative condition.

AB  - Abstract The vertebrate spleen has important functions in immunity and haematopoiesis, many of which have been well studied. In contrast, we know much less about the mechanisms governing its early embryonic development. However, as a result of work over the past decade-mostly using knockout mice?-significant progress has been made in unravelling the genetic processes governing the spleen's early development. Key genetic regulators, such as Tlx1 and Pbx1, have been identified, and we know some of the early transcriptional hierarchies that control the early patterning and proliferation of the splenic primordium. In mouse and humans, asplenia can arise as a result of laterality defects, or the spleen can be absent with no other discernible abnormalities. Surprisingly, given the spleen's diverse functions, asplenic individuals suffer no major haematopoietic or immune defects apart from a susceptibility to infection with encapsulated bacteria. Recent evidence has shed light on a previously unknown role of the spleen in the development and maintenance of specific B cell populations that are involved in the initial response to infection caused by encapsulated bacteria. The lack of these populations in asplenic mice and humans may go some way to explaining this susceptibility. BioEssays 29: 166?177, 2007. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Citation ?Bronson R. Biology of the male reproductive tract: Its cellular and morphological considerations. Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 212?219 For many years, the focus of attention in the study of semen has been on spermatozoa, its major cellular component, given their importance in the process of reproduction, and the role of the seminal fluid as their transport medium. More recently, evidence has accumulated of the complexity of seminal fluid, its components that perturb the female reproductive tract in ways promoting both survival of spermatozoa there-in and facilitating the implantation of embryos within the endometrium, hence initiating pregnancy. These same factors, however, may also make the female reproductive tract susceptible to invasion not only by spermatozoa but viruses, playing a significant role in the male-to-female transmission of HIV. Knowledge of the histology, anatomy, and immunology of the male reproductive tract is essential in understanding its role in HIV pathogenesis.
