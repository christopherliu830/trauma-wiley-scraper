AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.

AB  - Abstract Bioactive glasses (BAGs) are being investigated for the repair and reconstruction of bone defects, as they exhibit osteoconductive and osteostimulatory potential. However, successful bone regeneration requires also the neovascularization of the construct which is, among other factors, guided by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, BAG S53P4 (53% SiO2, 23% Na2O, 20% CaO, 4% P2O5) is investigated in relation to VEGF-release and response of fibroblast cells. Human CD-18CO fibroblasts were cultivated in contact with different granules of different sizes (0.5?0.8 mm, 1.0?2.0 mm, and 2.0?3.15 mm) and at different concentrations (0?1 wt/vol % of BAG) for 72 h. The analysis of morphology revealed no toxic effect for all granule sizes and concentrations. Compared with the reference, lactate dehydrogenase-activity of CCD-18CO cells increased in contact with BAG samples. The VEGF release from CCD-18CO fibroblasts cultured on different granule sizes and at different concentrations after 72 h of incubation was quantified. It was found that particles of 0.5?0.8 mm and 1.0?2.0 mm in size enhanced VEGF release, whereas BAG particle sizes of 2.0?3.15 mm led to inhibition of VEGF release. The results are relevant to understand the influence of the particle size and concentration of BAG S53P4 on VEGF expression and neovascularization. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background? A recent genome-wide association study in adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has implicated the interleukin 10 (IL-10) gene as an important candidate gene. Moreover, a UC-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3024405 was also significantly associated with adult Crohn?s disease (CD). Aims? To examine whether IL-10-CD associations extended to paediatric-onset CD. Methods? We implemented the case-control design at three paediatric gastroenterology clinics in Canada. CD patients (≤20?years) were recruited along with healthy controls. DNA samples were genotyped for tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag-SNPs) in the IL-10 gene. Allelic, genotype and haplotype associations with CD were studied. Results? A total of 270 patients and 336 controls were studied. The mean age (±s.d.) at diagnosis was 12.1 (±3.5). There were a slightly higher proportion of male patients (56.3%). Of the five IL-10 tag-SNPs, rs2222202 (C/T) (P?=?0.03) and rs1800871 (C/T) (P?=?0.05) showed significant allelic associations with CD. Specific IL-10 SNPs were associated with CD disease location and/or disease behaviour. Conclusions? Our gene-wide analysis replicates recent findings of associations between IL-10 and adult CD, and suggests that these associations extend to paediatric-onset CD as well.

AB  - Multiple pathological processes are responsible for renal transplant loss. Development of effective prophylactic regimens requires that risks associated with different outcomes be assessed when several processes act together. A multistate competing risk model that derived multiple endpoint probabilities without averaging impacts of covariates over different outcomes or overestimating fractions of survivors was used to estimate the influence of 16 factors simultaneously on four failure types (acute rejection, chronic rejection, death with a functioning graft and all other causes combined). We analyzed 12?413 non-Black and 5121 Black patients undergoing primary cadaveric kidney transplantation reported to UNOS during 1994?96. Black recipients generally demonstrated higher rates of failure, but the method provided joint probabilities for each failure type and covariate level. To illustrate, a middle-aged Black recipient had probabilities of 6.5%, 5.9%, 2.6% and 6.6% to experience acute rejection failure, chronic rejection failure, death with a functioning graft and other failures, respectively, within 3?years. The corresponding non-Black's chances were 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.6%. The overall 3-year survival equaled 78.4% [100%-(6.5%?+?5.9%?+?2.6%?+?6.6%)] and 88.3% for Blacks and non-Blacks, respectively. The growing complexity of transplantation will benefit from new analytic approaches that accommodate multiple transitions along diverse paths to eventual graft loss or death.

AB  - Abstract Primary intraosseous carcinoma (PIOC), NOS is a rare malignancy occurring in the jaw bones. It may arise de novo, or more commonly develop from pre-existing lesions such as odontogenic cysts or tumours. In this manuscript, we describe a case of PIOC in the mandible of a 17-year-old male. Complicating factors were a history of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Griscelli syndrome. Management included surgical removal and planned adjuvant chemoradiation. The relevant literature is reviewed with respect to PIOC in a paediatric population.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To review the distribution of orbital and intracranial disease in canine and feline patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist and to correlate results of MRI with pathologic conditions including neoplasia, suspected optic neuritis (ON) and orbital cellulitis. Recognized and emerging imaging techniques are reviewed. Procedure? Medical records of 79 canine and 13 feline patients were reviewed. Results? Neoplasia was diagnosed in 53/92 (57.6%) of patients. The most prevalent types of neoplasia were carcinoma (16/53, 30.1%), sarcoma (11/53, 20.8%), lymphoma (8/53, 15.1%) and presumptive meningioma (9/53, 17.0%). Carcinomas and sarcomas were characterized by bony lysis and intracranial/sinonasal extension. Lymphoma was generally unilateral, less invasive and originated from the ventromedial orbit. Intracranial masses representing presumptive meningiomas frequently exhibited a ?dural tail? sign. Diagnosis of suspected ON was made in 13 of 92 (14.1%) patients. Results of MRI in patients with suspected ON included unilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%), bilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (1/13, 7.7%) and optic chiasmal hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%). Seven suspected ON patients demonstrated intracranial multifocal patchy contrast enhancement (7/13, 53.8%). Diagnosis of orbital cellulitis was made in 12/92 (13.0%) patients. Conclusions? Orbital neoplasia was the most common pathologic condition detected. Essential Roentgen characteristics are helpful when diagnosing pathologic processes and providing prognoses in cases of orbital or intracranial disease. Magnetic resonance imaging comprises an important diagnostic component in cases of suspected ON. Emerging contrast and functional MRI techniques as well as SI data may increase our ability to characterize disease processes.
