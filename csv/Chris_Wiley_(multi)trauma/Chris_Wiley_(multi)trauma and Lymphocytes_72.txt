AB  - Abstract Objective? To review the distribution of orbital and intracranial disease in canine and feline patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist and to correlate results of MRI with pathologic conditions including neoplasia, suspected optic neuritis (ON) and orbital cellulitis. Recognized and emerging imaging techniques are reviewed. Procedure? Medical records of 79 canine and 13 feline patients were reviewed. Results? Neoplasia was diagnosed in 53/92 (57.6%) of patients. The most prevalent types of neoplasia were carcinoma (16/53, 30.1%), sarcoma (11/53, 20.8%), lymphoma (8/53, 15.1%) and presumptive meningioma (9/53, 17.0%). Carcinomas and sarcomas were characterized by bony lysis and intracranial/sinonasal extension. Lymphoma was generally unilateral, less invasive and originated from the ventromedial orbit. Intracranial masses representing presumptive meningiomas frequently exhibited a ?dural tail? sign. Diagnosis of suspected ON was made in 13 of 92 (14.1%) patients. Results of MRI in patients with suspected ON included unilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%), bilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (1/13, 7.7%) and optic chiasmal hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%). Seven suspected ON patients demonstrated intracranial multifocal patchy contrast enhancement (7/13, 53.8%). Diagnosis of orbital cellulitis was made in 12/92 (13.0%) patients. Conclusions? Orbital neoplasia was the most common pathologic condition detected. Essential Roentgen characteristics are helpful when diagnosing pathologic processes and providing prognoses in cases of orbital or intracranial disease. Magnetic resonance imaging comprises an important diagnostic component in cases of suspected ON. Emerging contrast and functional MRI techniques as well as SI data may increase our ability to characterize disease processes.

AB  - Summary While interleukin (IL)-1? plays an important role in combating the invading pathogen as part of the innate immune response, its dysregulation is responsible for a number of autoinflammatory disorders. Large IL-1? activating platforms, known as inflammasomes, can assemble in response to the detection of endogenous host and pathogen-associated danger molecules. Formation of these protein complexes results in the autocatalysis and activation of caspase-1, which processes precursor IL-1? into its secreted biologically active form. Inflammasome and IL-1? activity is required to efficiently control viral, bacterial and fungal pathogen infections. Conversely, excess IL-1? activity contributes to human disease, and its inhibition has proved therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of a spectrum of serious, yet relatively rare, heritable inflammasomopathies. Recently, inflammasome function has been implicated in more common human conditions, such as gout, type II diabetes and cancer. This raises the possibility that anti-IL-1 therapeutics may have broader applications than anticipated previously, and may be utilized across diverse disease states that are linked insidiously through unwanted or heightened inflammasome activity.

AB  - Abstract Background The metabolism of the essential trace element copper remains incompletely understood and, until recently, nearly ignored in acute medicine. Menkes disease was for long the only known copper deficiency condition, but several case reports and investigations conducted over the last 2 decades have shown that deficiency is more frequent than previously suspected, with devastating individual consequences and potential public health consequences. The copper needs in healthy individuals are 0.9 mg/d, which translates to 0.3 mg/d intravenously in parenteral nutrition; the present review aims at gathering actual knowledge. Method and results A review of literature was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane systematic reviews to identify the most recent information about copper deficiency and generate a narrative review. Copper deficiency has hereditary and acquired origins, the latter being the most frequent. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific but affect all organs and systems, particularly the hematologic (anemia) and the neurologic (myeloneuropathy) systems. Deficiency also affects the cardiovascular, cutaneous, and immune systems. Severe copper deficiency due to reduced absorption after bariatric bypass surgery has become frequent. Conclusion Deficiency is more frequent than previously recognized, probably because of changing nutrition patterns but also because of some treatments that have become very common such as bypass bariatric surgery and, in acute medicine, prolonged continuous renal replacement therapy. The patients may present with severe hematologic and neurologic complications that go untreated because copper deficiency was not considered in the differential diagnosis: These complications often need active intravenous repletion with doses 4?8 times the usual nutrition recommendations.

AB  - Background In cats, mastocytemia is considered to be confined to animals with mast cell tumors (MCT), whereas in dogs it is associated with diverse diseases. Objective The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of mastocytemia in cats. Methods All blood smears and buffy coat (BC) smears on which mast cells were identified over a 6-year period were retrospectively reviewed and mast cells counted. Mastocytemic cats were classified based on their clinical diagnosis. Results Mastocytemia was identified on 40 blood smears and 13 BC smears from 33 cats. The incidence of mastocytemia detected in cats during routine CBCs was 0.33% (40/12,116 CBCs). Twenty-two of 33 mastocytemic cats (67%) had visceral (n = 17) or cutaneous MCT (n = 7), including 2 that had concurrent visceral and cutaneous involvement. In 3 additional cases (9%), visceral MCT was clinically suspected, but no cytologic or histopathologic evaluation of visceral organs was performed. MCT was excluded in 3 of 33 mastocytemic cats (9%) with a final diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasia (n = 2) and multiorgan hemangiosarcoma (n = 1). Five additional animals (15%) had a diagnosis other than MCT, including lymphoma (n = 2) and chronic renal failure (n = 3), but no cytologic or histopathologic evaluation of the spleen was performed. Blood smears from cats with confirmed MCT had 1?113 mast cells per smear, whereas cats in which MCT was excluded had 1?2 mast cells per smear. Conclusions Data confirm that mastocytemia is rare and most commonly found in cats with visceral MCT; however, rare circulating mast cells may also be seen with neoplasms other than MCT.

AB  - Abstract Background We investigate whether optical imaging can reliably detect abnormalities in tissue, in a range of specimens (live cells in vitro; fixed, fresh ex-vivo and in vivo tissue), without the use of added contrast agents, and review our promising spectral methods for achieving quantitative, real-time, high resolution intrasurgical optical diagnostics. Methods We use reflectance, fluorescence, two-photon, and Mie scattering imaging, performed with instrumentation we developed or modified, to detect intrinsic tissue signatures. Emphasis is on spectral/hyperspectral imaging approaches allowing the equivalent of in vivo pathology. Results With experimental focus on unstained specimens, we demonstrate the ability to segment tissue images for cancer detection. Spectral reflectance imaging, coupled with advanced analysis, typically yields 90% specificity and sensitivity. Autofluorescence is also shown to be diagnostically useful, with lymph nodes results highlighted here. Elastic scattering hyperspectral imaging endoscopy, using a new instrument we designed and built, shows promise in bronchoscopic detection of dysplasia and early cancer in patients. Conclusions The results demonstrate that advanced optical imaging can detect and localize cellular signatures of cancer in real-time, in vivo, without the use of contrast agents, in animals and humans. This is an important step towards tight spatio-temporal coupling between such detection and clinical intervention. ? 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - Abstract Various micro-organisms have been implicated as causative agents for bacterial endocarditis, including lactobacilli and in particular the viridans streptococci which are more commonly associated with dental caries. Of these, the most frequently isolated one has the descriptive name Streptococcus sanguis. The disease is characterized by growth of microorganisms within a platelet-fibrin thrombus protruding from a valve leaflet. An understanding of the pathogenesis involves knowledge of the mechanisms of conversion of the normal vascular surface to a thrombogenic one and the adhesion of micro-organisms to such surfaces. Model systems to study this interaction include experimental animals, mammalian epithelial cells and platelets, and proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen. Microbial protein surface components (adhesins) and lipoteichoic acid have also been implicated. Capsular polysaccharides may be involved, but the role of dextrans formed from sucrose has been overemphasized as the polymers are not formed in situ. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk is based on bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. However, bacterial cell surface components involved in adhesion may also be affected, and knowledge of such reactions could provide a more rational basis for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition responsible for high mortality and the development of multiple organ dysfunctions, because of the lack of specific and effective therapies for ALI. Increasing evidence from pre-clinical studies supports preventive and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, also called mesenchymal stromal cells) in ALI/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Therapeutic effects of MSCs were noticed in various delivery approaches (systemic, local, or other locations), multiple origins (bone marrow or other tissues), or different schedules of administrations (before or after the challenges). MSCs could reduce the over-production of inflammatory mediators, leucocyte infiltration, tissue injury and pulmonary failure, and produce a number of benefit factors through interaction with other cells in the process of lung tissue repair. Thus, it is necessary to establish guidelines, standard operating procedures and evaluation criteria for translating MSC-based therapies into clinical application for patients with ALI.
