AB  - Summary: This review summarises experimental evidence to illustrate that induction of immune reactivity depends upon antigen reaching and being available in lymphoid organs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. If antigen reaches lymph organs in a localised staggered manner and with a concentration gradient, a response is induced in the draining lymph node. Antigen-presenting cells are of critical importance to transport antigen from the periphery to local organised lymphoid tissue. If antigen is all over the lymphoid system, then it deletes all specific cells in the thymus or induces them within a few days: because of their limited life-span they then die off, leaving the repertoire depleted of this specificity. If antigen does not reach lymphoid organs it is ignored by immune cells. Once a response is induced, activated but not resting T cells will reach antigen outside lymphoid organs, whereas activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells in an inducing environment, mostly in lymphoid tissue including bone marrow, but also in chronic lymphoid-like infiltrations in peripheral organs. In immunopathology (when the infectious agent is known) or in autoimmunity (when the triggering infectious agent is not known or not recognised) lymphoid tissue may become organised close to the antigen (e.g. in organ-specific autoimmune diseases) and may thereby maintain an autoantigen-driven disease-causing immune response for a long time, The notion that naive T cells get induced or silenced in the periphery may be questioned because induction can only occur in lymphoid organs providing anatomical structures where critical cell-cell interactions are properly guided and where, therefore, cells are likely to meet sufficiently frequently and in a critical milieu. Since overall immune reactivity critically depends upon the localisation of antigens in a dose- and time-dependent manner, it seems more likely - but this remains to be shown - that activated T cells may get exhausted in non-lymphoid peripheral tissues, whereas they are usually maintained in lymphoid organs. The critical role of antigen in regulating immune responses also has relevance for our understanding of immunological defence against epithelial and mesenchymal tumours, against many infectious diseases and for understanding autoimmunity and immunological memory. Collectively the data indicate that antigen, impendent upon localisation, dose and time, seems to be the simplest regulator of immune responses.

AB  - Abstract:? We present a case of an 8-year-old girl with collapse of her T6 and T7 vertebrae secondary to chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. She presented with chronic abdominal pain and was found to have multiple bony lesions involving her spine, clavicle and mandible. Extensive investigations, including tissue biopsy, were unable to identify an infective cause and there was no response to a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics. She made a good response to regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.

AB  - Abstract Various micro-organisms have been implicated as causative agents for bacterial endocarditis, including lactobacilli and in particular the viridans streptococci which are more commonly associated with dental caries. Of these, the most frequently isolated one has the descriptive name Streptococcus sanguis. The disease is characterized by growth of microorganisms within a platelet-fibrin thrombus protruding from a valve leaflet. An understanding of the pathogenesis involves knowledge of the mechanisms of conversion of the normal vascular surface to a thrombogenic one and the adhesion of micro-organisms to such surfaces. Model systems to study this interaction include experimental animals, mammalian epithelial cells and platelets, and proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen. Microbial protein surface components (adhesins) and lipoteichoic acid have also been implicated. Capsular polysaccharides may be involved, but the role of dextrans formed from sucrose has been overemphasized as the polymers are not formed in situ. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk is based on bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. However, bacterial cell surface components involved in adhesion may also be affected, and knowledge of such reactions could provide a more rational basis for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Mycobacterium marinum is a photochromogenic mycobacterium that is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. In the general population, exposure to aquaria is the most common cause of M. marinum infection. Known as ?swimmer's granuloma? or ?fish tank granuloma,? M. marinum is an occupational hazard for aquarium cleaners and fishermen. There are several reports in the literature of M. marinum infection in immunocompromised hosts, including those with solid organ transplants, but none in patients who have received stem cell transplants (SCTs). To our knowledge, this is a first report of disseminated M. marinum infection in an SCT recipient who continued to develop new skin lesions even after months of targeted therapy. The implications are that elderly patients who receive T-cell-depleted SCTs may be at prolonged risk for pathogens dependent on cellular immunity, and the presentation of illness with such pathogens may be more severe and widely disseminated than might otherwise be expected.

AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.

AB  - Abstract Resolution of inflammation is a coordinated and active process aimed at restoration of tissue integrity and function. This review integrates the key molecular and cellular mechanisms of resolution. We describe how abrogation of chemokine signalling blocks continued neutrophil tissue infiltration and how apoptotic neutrophils attract monocytes and macrophages to induce their clearance. Uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages reprograms macrophages towards a resolving phenotype, a key event to restore tissue homeostasis. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic potential that derives from understanding the mechanisms of resolution.

AB  - Summary Transplantation of vascularized knee joints is a novel approach in Composite Tissue Allotransplantation (CTA). In 1996 our group started a clinical knee transplantation project and six transplantations have been performed since. Key problems identified early were the monitoring of acute rejection and choice of an immunosuppressive regime. One graft was lost due to postoperative infection and one due to of noncompliance where the patient discontinued the immunosuppressant regime. In three cases late rejection lead to necrosis and graft dysfunction after 15, 16 and 24?months, respectively. Exit-strategies were arthrodesis in one patient and Above Knee Amputation in two cases. With retrospective analysis after initial five cases the treatment protocol was improved. The immunosuppressive drug regime was altered, femoral diaphysis and knee joint grafting was combined and a vascularized block of donor skin and subcutaneous tissue was harvested with the graft (sentinel skin graft). The sentinel skin graft enabled us to monitor acute rejection by clinical and histological examination and avoid late rejection by rapid treatment with high dose steroids. In summary, over a four-year period, one of six allogeneic vascularized knee transplants has survived, one was lost from a surgical site infection, one by noncompliance and three by late rejection. Analysis of our data leads us to suggest that knee transplantation should be limited to a combined injury consisting of extensive loss of cartilage and bone, deficient extensor mechanism and soft tissue and skin defects without any signs of infection. Transplantation should only be taken into consideration as last option before Above Knee Amputation in an otherwise healthy patient under 35?years of age.

AB  - Summary All organisms are exposed constantly to a variety of infectious and injurious stimuli. These induce inflammatory responses tailored to the threat posed. While the innate immune system is the front line of response to each stimulant, it has been considered traditionally to lack memory, acting in a generic fashion until the adaptive immune arm can take over. This outmoded simplification of the roles of innate and acquired arms of the immune system has been challenged by evidence of myeloid cells altering their response to subsequent encounters based on earlier exposure. This concept of ?innate immune memory? has been known for nearly a century, and is accepted among myeloid biologists. In recent years other innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, have been shown to display memory, suggesting that innate immune memory is a trait common to several cell types. During the last 30 years, evidence has slowly accumulated in favour of not only haematopoietic cells, but also stromal cells, being imbued with memory following inflammatory episodes. A recent publication showing this also to be true in epithelial cells suggests innate immune memory to be widespread, if under-appreciated, in non-haematopoietic cells. In this review, we will examine the evidence supporting the existence of innate immune memory in stromal cells. We will also discuss the ramifications of memory in long-lived tissue-resident cells. Finally, we will pose questions we feel to be important in the understanding of these forgotten cells in the field of innate memory.

AB  - Paraffin sections and more than 7,000 plastic cross-sections of temporal arteries from 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), 16 patients with a clinical diagnosis of temporal arteritis (TA) and 18 age- and sex-matched postmortem controls were studied using light microscopy. A new method was developed to permit a morphometric comparison between biopsies and autopsy specimens. Two stages of inflammation were discerned in TA. In atrophic arterial segments there was a focal, foreign-body, giant-cell reaction to the calcified internal elastic membrane (IEM) with a spatially correlated, mononuclear cell infiltration. Isolated giant cells were also found to attack the IEM in these cases. The majority of the biopsies displayed a different picture with a diffuse macrophage attack on media and intima with numerous and apparently macrophage-derived giant cells, which did not attack calcifications. The latter arteries were significantly widened (p < 0.02), which indicates that this phase is the later one. Non-inflamed segments of PMR vessels displayed a significant, non-reactive media atrophy compared with controls (p < 0.03) and their IEM calcifications were significantly larger (p < 0.02). The circumference was smaller in atrophic PMR arteries than in inflamed TA arteries (p < 0.006), which contradicts post-inflammatory scarring.
