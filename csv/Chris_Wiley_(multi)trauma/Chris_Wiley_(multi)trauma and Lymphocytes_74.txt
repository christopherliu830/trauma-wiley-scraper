AB  - Abstract Aucubin (AU) is the main active ingredient of Aucuba japonica which has showed many positive effects such as anti-inflammation and liver protection. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. In this research, we explored the effects of AU on the tyloxapol-induced NAFLD in mice and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) induced-3T3L1 cells. Tyloxapol (300 mg/kg) was injected to C57BL/6 mice with aucubin. The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with or without aucubin after stimulation of apoC-III (100 ?g/mL). In results, aucubin inhibited hyperlipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumour necrosis factor receptor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 in blood. AU activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), PPAR? and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), AMPK?, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, AU performed the function of hypolipidaemic by its obvious anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity, which may become a kind of new drug targeting at NAFLD.

AB  - Summary Herpes simplex virus (HSV) represents a smart pathogen, which displays both lytic and latent modes of interaction with its natural human host. In order to be optimally equipped for immune evasion and to reply to any attacks of the host during reactivation, HSV has developed a multitude of cleverly devised defence strategies. Dendritic cells (DC) as antigen-presenting cells located at the border zones of the body and the environment have been shown to play a crucial role as one of the first cells interacting with HSV beside epithelial cells, on one hand, and as important controllers of the viral spreading on the other hand. Here, we provide a research update about the interaction of HSV with DC and summarize the latest proceedings in this field.

AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.

AB  - Summary: Seventeen patients with Behcet's syndrome were evaluated clinically, immunologically and therapeutically. The variable and extensive clinical manifestations included scantyfungiform papillae in six patients, bullous skin eruption in two, non-specific skin sensitivity in six, bladder ulceration in two, and psychoneurosis. Immunological abnormalities included raised α2 globulin in 14 patients, hypogammaglobulinaemia in one, cryoproteins in three, foetal oral mucosa antibodies in three and pemphigus antibody in two. Intradermal injection of autologous plasma produced an Arthus reaction in eight out of 11 patients tested. It is suggested that some plasma component may be responsible for vasculitis in these patients. Treatment was attempted with various combinations of corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide, phenformin and ethyloestrenol. Seven patients had a satisfactory response in that all manifestations of their syndrome were well controlled.

AB  - Paraffin sections and more than 7,000 plastic cross-sections of temporal arteries from 27 patients with a clinical diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), 16 patients with a clinical diagnosis of temporal arteritis (TA) and 18 age- and sex-matched postmortem controls were studied using light microscopy. A new method was developed to permit a morphometric comparison between biopsies and autopsy specimens. Two stages of inflammation were discerned in TA. In atrophic arterial segments there was a focal, foreign-body, giant-cell reaction to the calcified internal elastic membrane (IEM) with a spatially correlated, mononuclear cell infiltration. Isolated giant cells were also found to attack the IEM in these cases. The majority of the biopsies displayed a different picture with a diffuse macrophage attack on media and intima with numerous and apparently macrophage-derived giant cells, which did not attack calcifications. The latter arteries were significantly widened (p < 0.02), which indicates that this phase is the later one. Non-inflamed segments of PMR vessels displayed a significant, non-reactive media atrophy compared with controls (p < 0.03) and their IEM calcifications were significantly larger (p < 0.02). The circumference was smaller in atrophic PMR arteries than in inflamed TA arteries (p < 0.006), which contradicts post-inflammatory scarring.

AB  - Summary All organisms are exposed constantly to a variety of infectious and injurious stimuli. These induce inflammatory responses tailored to the threat posed. While the innate immune system is the front line of response to each stimulant, it has been considered traditionally to lack memory, acting in a generic fashion until the adaptive immune arm can take over. This outmoded simplification of the roles of innate and acquired arms of the immune system has been challenged by evidence of myeloid cells altering their response to subsequent encounters based on earlier exposure. This concept of ?innate immune memory? has been known for nearly a century, and is accepted among myeloid biologists. In recent years other innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, have been shown to display memory, suggesting that innate immune memory is a trait common to several cell types. During the last 30 years, evidence has slowly accumulated in favour of not only haematopoietic cells, but also stromal cells, being imbued with memory following inflammatory episodes. A recent publication showing this also to be true in epithelial cells suggests innate immune memory to be widespread, if under-appreciated, in non-haematopoietic cells. In this review, we will examine the evidence supporting the existence of innate immune memory in stromal cells. We will also discuss the ramifications of memory in long-lived tissue-resident cells. Finally, we will pose questions we feel to be important in the understanding of these forgotten cells in the field of innate memory.
