AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract The genetic heritage for decades has been considered to respond only to gene promoters or suppressors, with specific roles for oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Epigenetics is progressively attracting increasing interest because it has demonstrated the capacity of these regulatory processes to regulate the gene expression without modifying gene sequence. Several factors may influence epigenetics, such as lifestyles including food selection. A role for physical exercise is emerging in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In this review, we resume physiological and pathological implications of epigenetic modification induced by the physical activity (PA). Inflammation and cancer mechanisms, immune system, central nervous system, and the aging process receive benefits due to PA through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, the modulation of epigenetic processes by physical exercise positively influences prevention, development, and the course of inflammatory and cancer diseases, as well as neurodegenerative illnesses. This growing field of studies gives rise to a new role for PA as an option in prevention strategies and to integrate pharmacological therapeutic treatments.

AB  - Summary Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a grave complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and effective treatment is undefined. Five patients with postHSCT TMA, which was refractory to at least 1?week of plasma exchange and prednisolone, were treated with rituximab (375?mg/m2/week???4). Remission was achieved in four patients, of whom three remained in remission and one had died of sepsis at a median follow-up of 10?months. ADAMTS13 levels were low in all evaluable patients, and only one patient showed significant anti-ADAMTS13 antibody. The levels of ADAMTS13 and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody did not change significantly with rituximab-induced remission.

AB  - Abstract A 6-year-old, spayed female, domestic shorthair cat was presented to the University of Georgia Veterinary Teaching Hospital for a 3-year history of a nonhealing wound on the right tarsus. The wound temporarily resolved with medical management, but intermittently recurred when antimicrobials were discontinued. At presentation, the wound had become refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Physical examination revealed a 1 cm diameter crust along the medial aspect of the right tarsus. Proximal to the crust, were 2 non-painful, fluctuant swollen areas that were free of drainage. Cytologic evaluation revealed atypical granulated cells, and a mesenchymal neoplasm was interpreted as a top differential diagnosis. Histopathology revealed marked, chronic, multifocal, pyogranulomatous dermatitis with abundant intralesional colonies of gram-positive, acid-fast-negative, filamentous bacteria. PCR and sequencing confirmed the infection to be caused by Actinomadura vinacea.

AB  - Background Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) is a relatively novel approach to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). The purpose of this analysis is to determine the surgical outcomes of patients who undergo purely EES of the CVJ. Methods A search for articles related to EES of the CVJ was performed using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. A bibliographic search was done for additional articles. Demographics, presenting symptoms, imaging findings, complications, follow-up, and patient outcomes were analyzed. Results Eighty-five patients from 30 articles were included. The mean patient age was 47.9 ± 24.8 years (range, 3 to 96 years), with 44.7% being male. The most common presenting symptom was myelopathy (n = 64, 75.3%). The most common indications for surgery were brainstem compression secondary to basilar invagination (n = 41, 48.2%) and odontoid pannus (n = 20, 23.5%). Odontoidectomy was performed in 97.6% of cases. Intraoperative complications occurred in 16 patients (18.8%) and postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients (21.2%). Six patients developed postoperative respiratory failure necessitating a tracheostomy. Neurologic improvement was seen in 89.4% of patients at a mean follow-up of 22.2 months. Conclusion Our analysis found that EES of the CVJ results in a high rate of neurologic improvement with acceptable complication rates. Given its minimally invasive nature and high success rate, this approach appears to be a reasonable alternative to the traditional transoral approach in select cases. This study represents the largest pooled sample size of EES of the CVJ to date. Increasing use of the endoscopic endonasal approach will allow for further studies with greater statistical power.
