AB  - Abstract: Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has increasingly become an accepted treatment for many childhood diseases and disorders. Potential HSCT recipients can be children with hematological malignancies or solid tumors, as well as congenital and acquired disorders. In the past decade, the use of HSCT in the treatment of pediatric disorders has grown exponentially while advances in supportive care have improved survival rate, contributing to a rapidly growing population of transplant survivors. Although numerous similarities can be found between pediatric and adult long-term HSCT survivors, this article provides a brief overview of the pediatric patients, emphasizing the aspects of surveillance and late effects. Understanding the long-term complications that can occur after HSCT is important in determining the appropriate evaluations and medical treatment for the patient involved. The goal of this article is to assist caregivers in providing optimal care for long-term survivors of HSCT. The initial section of this work comprises the three major causes of late effects in HSCT. It will then encompass a system review of the different potential complications that are seen with HSCT.

AB  - Abstract Background? The interaction between the OX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 has been suggested to have pathogenetic significance in atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective? The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and relevance of OX40L and OX40 in AD skin. Methods? OX40L and OX40 were stained immunohistochemically on the cryosections of the lesional and non-lesional skin of 17 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and of 10 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated keratinocytes and cell membrane preparations from PMA-stimulated keratinocytes or LAD-2 mast cells were incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence or absence of blocking monoclonal antibodies to OX40L, CD30L or ICAM-1. Results? We show for the first time that the staining intensity of OX40L and the number of OX40+ cells are significantly greater in the lesional dermis than in the healthy-looking dermis in AD (P?<?0.001 in both comparisons) and also in psoriasis (P?=?0.01 and P?<?0.001 respectively), but neither molecule correlate significantly with the clinical severity of AD. Living keratinocytes and cell membranes from LAD-2 mast cells and keratinocytes increased the PBMC proliferation response. Anti-OX40L antibody inhibited, in a similar fashion as anti-ICAM-1 and anti-CD30L, PBMC proliferation induced by LAD-2 membranes, but stimulated that induced by keratinocytes. Conclusion? Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of OX40 and OX40L in the pathogenesis of AD though they are not specific to AD and in vitro results suggest complex interaction.

AB  - Abstract Chronic nonhealing wounds cause significant morbidity and mortality and remain a challenging condition to treat. Regenerative wound surgery involves operative debridement of wounds to remove dead and healing-impaired tissue and bacterial contamination and, subsequently, the application of regenerative medicine treatments to accelerate healing. Regenerative treatments aim to restore native tissue structure and function by targeting biological mechanisms underlying impaired healing. A wide range of regenerative modalities are used for treating chronic and complex wounds, including decellularized scaffolds, living engineered donor tissues, autologous stem cells, and recombinant growth factors. Each of these modalities has specific and sometimes complex requirements for implementation. The advanced wound care team, including OR staff members, should be aware of how these products are used and regulated. This article highlights some of the common and emerging regenerative treatments that are applied in wound surgery and focuses on how the products are used practically in the OR.

AB  - Abstract The genetic heritage for decades has been considered to respond only to gene promoters or suppressors, with specific roles for oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Epigenetics is progressively attracting increasing interest because it has demonstrated the capacity of these regulatory processes to regulate the gene expression without modifying gene sequence. Several factors may influence epigenetics, such as lifestyles including food selection. A role for physical exercise is emerging in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In this review, we resume physiological and pathological implications of epigenetic modification induced by the physical activity (PA). Inflammation and cancer mechanisms, immune system, central nervous system, and the aging process receive benefits due to PA through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, the modulation of epigenetic processes by physical exercise positively influences prevention, development, and the course of inflammatory and cancer diseases, as well as neurodegenerative illnesses. This growing field of studies gives rise to a new role for PA as an option in prevention strategies and to integrate pharmacological therapeutic treatments.

AB  - Conventional heart rate variability (HRV) indices comprise time domain and frequency domain HRV indices that not only reflect the autonomic control of the heart but also serve as prognostic markers of various cardiovascular disorders. These indices have been extensively investigated as prognostic factors for patients who develop coronary artery diseases including myocardial infarction (MI). Non-linear indices of HRV such as the long (?)- and short (Î±1 and ?2)-term fractal component indices and approximate entropy analysis have been clinically applied. In addition, heart rate turbulence (HRT) and the deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate have been studied as potential HRV indices for predicting untoward outcomes of cardiovascular diseases. This overview examines HRV indices and their roles in the setting of cardiovascular disorders including sudden cardiac death. We describe changes in HRV indices and clarify the relationship between prognosis and the indices in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units.

AB  - Abstract Background? Verrucous leprosy is rare, with only 18 cases reported in the literature. Visceral involvement is frequent but often overlooked, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Case report? A 45-year-old Filipino male with a 16-year history of hyperpigmented, hypoesthetic plaques, amputated digits, enlarged ulnar nerve, and cardiovascular congestion was diagnosed with Hansen?s disease ? lepromatous type. He had multiple cauliflower-like nodules and plaques with foul-smelling discharge on the lower extremities presenting a diagnostic dilemma. After an exhaustive search, the causative agent for these verrucous nodules was confirmed to still be Mycobacterium leprae. In addition, he had glomerulonephritis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, neuritis, keratitis, and glaucoma, which are all complications of advanced leprosy and multiple attacks of erythema nodosum leprosum reactions. Conclusion? He was treated with a multibacillary regimen of Rifampicin, Dapsone, Clofazimine, and systemic corticosteroids, with remarkable improvement.
