AB  - Abstract. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary vasculitis of adults. The incidence of this disease is practically nil in the population under the age of 50?years, then rises dramatically with each passing decade. The median age of onset of the disease is about 75?years. As the ageing population expands, it is increasingly important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with GCA and its various manifestations, ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic. A heightened awareness of this condition can avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is well known that prompt initiation of steroids remains the most effective means for preventing potentially devastating ischaemic complications. This review summarizes the current concepts regarding the immunopathogenetic pathways that lead to arteritis and the major phenotypic subtypes of GCA with emphasis on large vessel vasculitis, novel modalities for disease detection and investigative trials using alternative, non-steroid therapies.

AB  - Anti-ganglioside antibody production and dysfunction of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCB) are frequent findings in dysimmune neuropathy patients, whereas intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins is still a matter of debate. We examined the CSF, immunological and electrophysiological characteristics from a cohort of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and from patients with other neurological diseases as control. Thirty-eight percent of GBS patients and 28% of CIDP patients had detectable serum titers of anti-ganglioside antibodies, which were associated with a high incidence of motor conduction block and increased F wave latencies. In GBS patients, but not in CIDP or control patients, there was an association between anti-ganglioside antibodies and increased CSF immunoglobulin-G (IgG) levels as determined by the IgG index. However, none of the GBS patients had CSF oligoclonal bands (OBs) or indications of intrathecal anti-ganglioside antibody synthesis. The possibility of an abnormal CSF concentration of immunoglobulins from serum through dysfunctional BCB or damaged nerve roots, and the role of serum anti-ganglioside reactivity in this process are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Chronic nonhealing wounds cause significant morbidity and mortality and remain a challenging condition to treat. Regenerative wound surgery involves operative debridement of wounds to remove dead and healing-impaired tissue and bacterial contamination and, subsequently, the application of regenerative medicine treatments to accelerate healing. Regenerative treatments aim to restore native tissue structure and function by targeting biological mechanisms underlying impaired healing. A wide range of regenerative modalities are used for treating chronic and complex wounds, including decellularized scaffolds, living engineered donor tissues, autologous stem cells, and recombinant growth factors. Each of these modalities has specific and sometimes complex requirements for implementation. The advanced wound care team, including OR staff members, should be aware of how these products are used and regulated. This article highlights some of the common and emerging regenerative treatments that are applied in wound surgery and focuses on how the products are used practically in the OR.

AB  - Abstract: Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has increasingly become an accepted treatment for many childhood diseases and disorders. Potential HSCT recipients can be children with hematological malignancies or solid tumors, as well as congenital and acquired disorders. In the past decade, the use of HSCT in the treatment of pediatric disorders has grown exponentially while advances in supportive care have improved survival rate, contributing to a rapidly growing population of transplant survivors. Although numerous similarities can be found between pediatric and adult long-term HSCT survivors, this article provides a brief overview of the pediatric patients, emphasizing the aspects of surveillance and late effects. Understanding the long-term complications that can occur after HSCT is important in determining the appropriate evaluations and medical treatment for the patient involved. The goal of this article is to assist caregivers in providing optimal care for long-term survivors of HSCT. The initial section of this work comprises the three major causes of late effects in HSCT. It will then encompass a system review of the different potential complications that are seen with HSCT.

AB  - Abstract Background? The interaction between the OX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 has been suggested to have pathogenetic significance in atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective? The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and relevance of OX40L and OX40 in AD skin. Methods? OX40L and OX40 were stained immunohistochemically on the cryosections of the lesional and non-lesional skin of 17 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and of 10 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated keratinocytes and cell membrane preparations from PMA-stimulated keratinocytes or LAD-2 mast cells were incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence or absence of blocking monoclonal antibodies to OX40L, CD30L or ICAM-1. Results? We show for the first time that the staining intensity of OX40L and the number of OX40+ cells are significantly greater in the lesional dermis than in the healthy-looking dermis in AD (P?<?0.001 in both comparisons) and also in psoriasis (P?=?0.01 and P?<?0.001 respectively), but neither molecule correlate significantly with the clinical severity of AD. Living keratinocytes and cell membranes from LAD-2 mast cells and keratinocytes increased the PBMC proliferation response. Anti-OX40L antibody inhibited, in a similar fashion as anti-ICAM-1 and anti-CD30L, PBMC proliferation induced by LAD-2 membranes, but stimulated that induced by keratinocytes. Conclusion? Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of OX40 and OX40L in the pathogenesis of AD though they are not specific to AD and in vitro results suggest complex interaction.

AB  - Summary.? Haemarthroses (intra-articular haemorrhages) are a frequent finding typically observed in patients with haemophilia. Diagnosis and treatment of these bleeding episodes must be delivered as early as possible. Additionally, treatment should ideally be administered intensively (enhanced on-demand treatment) until the resolution of symptoms. Joint aspiration plays an important role in acute and profuse haemarthroses as the presence of blood in the joint leads to chondrocyte apoptosis and chronic synovitis, which will eventually result in joint degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy). Ultrasonography (US) is an appropriate diagnostic technique to assess the evolution of acute haemarthrosis in haemophilia, although magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard as far as imaging techniques are concerned. Some patients experience subclinical haemarthroses, which eventually tend to result in some degree of arthropathy, especially in the ankles. Nowadays, the most effective way of protecting these patients is primary prophylaxis, which in practice changes severe haemophilia into moderate haemophilia, preventing or at least minimizing the occurrence of haemarthrosis. If primary prophylaxis is, for whatever reason not an option, secondary prophylaxis and enhanced on demand treatment should be considered. Two alternatives are available for inhibitor patients: (i) control of haemostasis using by-passing agents (rFVIIa or aPCCs) either as enhanced on demand treatment or secondary prophylaxis, as appropriate, following the same basic principles used for non-inhibitor patients and (ii) immune tolerance induction (ITI) to eradicate the inhibitor.
