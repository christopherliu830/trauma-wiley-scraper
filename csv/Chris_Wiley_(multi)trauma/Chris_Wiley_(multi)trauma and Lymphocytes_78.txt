AB  - Abstract Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory skin disease that usually involves the anogenital area. All patients with symptoms or signs suspicious of lichen sclerosus should be seen at least once initially by a physician with a special interest in the disease in order to avoid delay in diagnosis, as early treatment may cure the disease in some and reduce or prevent scarring. The diagnosis is made clinically in most cases. Biopsies should only be performed under certain circumstances. The gold standard for treatment remains potent to very potent topical steroids; however, mild and moderate disease in boys and men may be cured by circumcision. Certain triggers should be avoided. http://www.euroderm.org/images/stories/guidelines/2014/S3-Guideline-on-Lichen-sclerosus.pdf http://www.awmf.org/fachgesellschaften/mitgliedsgesellschaften/visitenkarte/fg/deutsche-gesellschaft-fuer-gynaekologie-und-geburtshilfe-dggg.html.

AB  - Summary.? Haemarthroses (intra-articular haemorrhages) are a frequent finding typically observed in patients with haemophilia. Diagnosis and treatment of these bleeding episodes must be delivered as early as possible. Additionally, treatment should ideally be administered intensively (enhanced on-demand treatment) until the resolution of symptoms. Joint aspiration plays an important role in acute and profuse haemarthroses as the presence of blood in the joint leads to chondrocyte apoptosis and chronic synovitis, which will eventually result in joint degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy). Ultrasonography (US) is an appropriate diagnostic technique to assess the evolution of acute haemarthrosis in haemophilia, although magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard as far as imaging techniques are concerned. Some patients experience subclinical haemarthroses, which eventually tend to result in some degree of arthropathy, especially in the ankles. Nowadays, the most effective way of protecting these patients is primary prophylaxis, which in practice changes severe haemophilia into moderate haemophilia, preventing or at least minimizing the occurrence of haemarthrosis. If primary prophylaxis is, for whatever reason not an option, secondary prophylaxis and enhanced on demand treatment should be considered. Two alternatives are available for inhibitor patients: (i) control of haemostasis using by-passing agents (rFVIIa or aPCCs) either as enhanced on demand treatment or secondary prophylaxis, as appropriate, following the same basic principles used for non-inhibitor patients and (ii) immune tolerance induction (ITI) to eradicate the inhibitor.

AB  - Dry eye conditions are prevalent with one in four to five patients presenting to eye care practitioners having dry eye signs and/or symptoms. An intimate relationship exists between the ocular surface and the tear film. The cycle of tear film instability and ocular surface damage characteristic of dry eye conditions suggests that dry eye represents a dysfunction of an integrated ocular surface-lacrimal gland unit. Therefore, dry eye is a multifactorial condition and an approach based on clinical subtypes is required for diagnosis and management. There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a contributing and exacerbating factor in dry eye conditions and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for chronic dry eye conditions may facilitate ocular surface healing. Other promising new treatments for dry eye include new generation artificial tear polymers and preservative systems, secretagogues, topical androgen supplements and surgical techniques for ocular surface reconstruction.

AB  - Summary The introduction of immunotherapy with checkpoint receptor blockade has changed the treatment of advanced cancers, at times inducing prolonged remission. Nevertheless, the success rate of the approach is variable across patients and different tumor types, and treatment is often accompanied by severe immune-related side effects, suggesting the importance of co-inhibitory pathway for both prevention of autoimmunity and failure of tumor rejection. A better understanding of how to uncouple anti-tumor activity from loss of self-tolerance is necessary to increase the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint immunotherapy. In this review, we describe basic concepts of T-cell exhaustion that occur in cancer, highlighting the role of co-inhibitory receptors in contributing to this process while preventing immunopathology. By providing an overview of the current therapeutic success and immune-related burden of secondary effects of checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate the ?double-edged sword? related to interference with immune-regulatory pathways. Finally, since achieving tumor rejection while preserving self-tolerance is particularly important for the central nervous system, we analyze the case for checkpoint immunotherapy in glioblastoma, the most common adult brain tumor.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the humanized antibody ATM-027 in a baseline versus treatment magnetic resonance imaging-monitored study. Expansion of V?5.2/5.3+ T cells has been demonstrated in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain lesions of MS patients. In a phase I study, ATM-027 depleted these cells in peripheral blood and, in parallel, T-cell MBP reactivity and IFN-? expression were reduced. We studied 59 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (47 on ATM-027 and 12 on placebo) stratified for HLA-DR2 status. Monthly intravenous injections were given for 6 months. Individual dose titration was employed to obtain depletion of the target T-cell level and downregulation of antigen receptor density as monitored by flow cytometry. Five monthly magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed before treatment to establish baseline activity, six during treatment, and three during follow-up. Additional immunological assessments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ATM-027. The treatment was safe and well tolerated, inducing consistent suppression of the target cell population. During run-in, active lesions were found in 78.7% (37/47) of patients treated with ATM-027. During treatment, the median number of lesions was reduced by 33% (p = 0.13) independent of DR2 status. The corresponding volume of enhancement was 221 mm3 at baseline, with a reduction of 10% during treatment. Decreased numbers of cells expressing interferon-? messenger RNA, and decreased T-cell reactivity to several myelin antigens were found in ATM-027 treated patients. In conclusion, consistent suppression of V? 5.2/5.3+ T cells was achieved. However, the effect size on magnetic resonance imaging was considerably less than the targeted 60%.
