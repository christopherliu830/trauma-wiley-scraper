AB  - Abstract Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is genetically heterogeneous. Variable phenotypic manifestations within families with normal and affected patients have been attributed to the number and type of HPE gene mutations. Environmental agents may also contribute to the severity as well as the requirement of multiple hits. Clinical expression is extremely variable ranging from minor facial signs to complex craniofacial anomalies such as cyclopia. Main genes involved include SHH, GLI2, PTCH1, TGIF, ZIC2, TDGF1, SIX3; however, several other candidates have been proposed. Recently it was established that the human growth arrest specific gene 1 (GAS1) is a potential locus for several human craniofacial malformations. Here, we report on four Brazilian patients with GAS1 DNA sequence change who presented variable phenotypical manifestations ranging from classic HPE to HPE-like signs. Two patients had single DNA sequence change in the GAS1 gene, while in other two, an additional mutation in the SHH gene was observed. Clinical manifestations presented by these patients suggest that GAS1 could be considered a candidate locus for one of the types of human HPE. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The introduction of immunotherapy with checkpoint receptor blockade has changed the treatment of advanced cancers, at times inducing prolonged remission. Nevertheless, the success rate of the approach is variable across patients and different tumor types, and treatment is often accompanied by severe immune-related side effects, suggesting the importance of co-inhibitory pathway for both prevention of autoimmunity and failure of tumor rejection. A better understanding of how to uncouple anti-tumor activity from loss of self-tolerance is necessary to increase the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint immunotherapy. In this review, we describe basic concepts of T-cell exhaustion that occur in cancer, highlighting the role of co-inhibitory receptors in contributing to this process while preventing immunopathology. By providing an overview of the current therapeutic success and immune-related burden of secondary effects of checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate the ?double-edged sword? related to interference with immune-regulatory pathways. Finally, since achieving tumor rejection while preserving self-tolerance is particularly important for the central nervous system, we analyze the case for checkpoint immunotherapy in glioblastoma, the most common adult brain tumor.

AB  - Abstract BK disease is an opportunistic infection in organ transplant recipients and patients with other cellular immunodeficiencies. To the best of our knowledge, we report the second case of BK meningoencephalitis associated with nephropathy in a kidney transplant recipient. A 15-yr-old boy underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant without complications; however, 11 wk after the transplantation, he was admitted to the hospital for graft dysfunction and cytopenia, which were confirmed by BK nephropathy (plasma viral replication and histological evidence). Four days after his hospital admission, he developed a high-grade fever and headache. CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis with a positive PCR for BK virus. Reduction in immunosuppression and supportive care conducting cycles of immunoglobulin and cidofovir were successful in treating the patient. BK meningoencephalitis should be considered in kidney transplant recipients who present with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis.

AB  - Abstract Pioneering clinical stem cell research is being performed in the horse, a recipient of cutting edge veterinary medicine as well as a unique animal model, paving the way for human medical applications. Although demonstrable progress has been made on the clinical front, in vitro characterization of equine stem cells is still in comparatively early stages. To translate the promising results of clinical stem cell therapy in the horse, advances must be made in the characterization of equine stem cells. Aiming to improve communication between veterinarians and other natural scientists, this review gives an overview of veterinary ?bedside? achievements, focusing on stem cell therapies in equine orthopedics as well as the current state of in vitro characterization of equine multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and equine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ? 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses common neurologic disorders related to specific bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It describes pathogens to which the elderly patient is more susceptible, along with specific differential diagnostic considerations in this patient population. In addition, the chapter discusses appropriate treatments and toxicities to which the elderly patient is more susceptible. An anatomopathologic approach is employed to facilitate syndrome recognition and differential diagnosis generation. The chapter talks about pathogen-specific immune responses because clinical manifestations of nervous system infections reflect complex interactions between specific pathogens and the immune system. Finally, it reviews immunosenescence (age-related changes in immune function) both generally and in the central nervous system (CNS) specifically.
