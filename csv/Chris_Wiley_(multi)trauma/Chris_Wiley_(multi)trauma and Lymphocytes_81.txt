AB  - Summary Central nervous system infections are frequently devastating and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Although the brain possesses several defence mechanisms (e.g. intact cranium, blood?brain barrier) to prevent infection, once microorganisms reach the central nervous system, host defence mechanisms are inadequate to control the infection. Antimicrobial therapy is also limited by the poor penetration of many agents into the central nervous system. This chapter reviews meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema, epidural abscess, encephalitis, postpolio syndrome and Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease, stressing recent developments in diagnosis and therapy and the use of adjunctive treatment strategies that have been shown to improve outcome in patients with some of these devastating infections.

AB  - Summary In the 1960s, our predecessors won a historical battle against acute rejection and ensured that transplantation became a common life-saving treatment. In parallel with this success, or perhaps because of it, we lost the battle for long-lived transplants, being overwhelmed with chronic immune insults and the toxicities of immunosuppression. It is likely that current powerful treatments block acute rejection, but at the same time condemn the few circulating donor cells that would have been able to elicit immunoregulatory host responses towards the allograft. Under these conditions, spontaneously tolerant kidney recipients ? i.e. patients who maintain allograft function in the absence of immunosuppression ? are merely accidents; they are scarce, mysterious and precious. Several teams pursue the goal of finding a biomarker that would guide us towards the 'just right? level of immunosuppression that avoids rejection while leaving some space for donor immune cells. Some cellular assays are attractive because they are antigen-specific, and provide a comprehensive view of immune responses toward the graft. These seem to closely follow patient regulatory capacities. However, these tests are cumbersome, and require abundant cellular material from both donor and recipient. The latest newcomers, non-antigen-specific recipient blood transcriptomic biomarkers, offer the promise that a practicable and simple signature may be found that overcomes the complexity of a system in which an infinite number of individual cell combinations can lead possibly to graft acceptance. Biomarker studies are as much an objective ? identifying tolerant patients, enabling tolerance trials ? as a means to deciphering the underlying mechanisms of one of the most important current issues in transplantation.

AB  - Abstract . Secretions of the tick salivary glands are essential to the successful completion of the prolonged feeding of these ectoparasites as well as the conduit by which most tick-borne pathogens are transmitted to the host. In ixodid ticks the salivary glands are the organs of osmoregulation, and excess water from the bloodmeal is returned via saliva into the host. Host blood must continue to flow into the feeding lesion as well as remain fluid in the tick mouthparts and gut. The host's haemostatic mechanisms are thwarted by various anti-platelet aggregatory, anticoagulatory and anti-vasoconstrictory factors in tick saliva. Saliva components suppress the immune and inflammatory response of the host permitting the ticks to remain on the host for an extended period of time and, adventitiously, enhancing the transmission and establishment of tick-borne pathogens. Over the years much work has been done on the numerous enzyme and pharmacological activities found in the tick saliva. The present article reviews the most recent work on salivary gland secretionith special emphasis on how they favour pathogen transmission.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews some examples of other clinical conditions affecting the respiratory system and also some systemic diseases with major pulmonary involvement. Diseases of the respiratory system can be classified into four categories: diseases affecting the airways, diseases of the lung parenchyma (alveoli and lung interstitium), pulmonary vascular disease, and neuromuscular diseases affecting respiratory function. All levels of the respiratory system may be involved, including the larynx, central airways, peripheral airways, lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature, pleura, chest wall, and respiratory muscles. The intrathoracic airways can be extrapulmonary or intrapulmonary, in which case they are influenced by lung elastic recoil. Impaired gas transfer, with reduced transfer factor for carbon monoxide and transfer coefficient, is the hallmark of diseases of the alveoli and lung parenchyma. Pneumonia due to infection of the lung parenchyma results in an acute inflammatory exudate in the alveoli.
