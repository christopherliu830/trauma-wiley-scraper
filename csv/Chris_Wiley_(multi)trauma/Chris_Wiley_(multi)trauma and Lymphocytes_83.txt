AB  - Abstract Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections are a common approach in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The effectiveness of injections and particular injection products is often discussed and debated in clinical arenas. The following therapeutic review examines the evidence for intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injections in the management of OA knee. A review of research evidence, published guidelines and clinical literature was undertaken following an electronic database and relevant literature search. The review found that there is limited evidence which indicates that a single dose intra-articular MPA injection can provide short to medium term benefits for pain, with less evidence for beneficial effects on function or stiffness. There is heterogeneity across studies and until recently, most studies had only short to medium term follow-up periods, thus limiting the evidence available on longer term benefit. There was also evidence indicating equivalent overall efficacy of MPA to that of other corticosteroid products. Most guideline recommendations concerning IA injections for OA knee have drawn on evidence from pooled data for several corticosteroid products. The review also found there was limited reporting of the incidence of adverse events in most studies. Overall, MPA shows efficacy for symptom relief in OA knee. At an individual management level, evidence for a limited duration of effect needs consideration in injections decisions. Furthermore, consensus across clinical guidelines suggests that the management of OA knee should be individualized to a person's clinical history, degree of disability, risk factors, quality of life and personal preferences, whereby injecting involves a shared decision and forms part of a multimodal approach.

AB  - Computational mechanistic models constitute powerful tools for summarizing our knowledge in quantitative terms, providing mechanistic understanding, and generating new hypotheses. The present review emphasizes the advantages of reusing publicly available computational models as a way to capitalize on existing knowledge, reduce the number of parameters that need to be adjusted to experimental data, and facilitate hypothesis generation. Finally, it includes a step-by-step example of the reuse and adaptation of an existing model of immune responses to tuberculosis, tumor growth, and blood pathogens, to study donor-specific antibody (DSA) responses. This review aims to illustrate the benefit of leveraging the currently available computational models in immunology to accelerate the study of alloimmune responses, and to encourage modelers to share their models to further advance our understanding of transplant immunology.

AB  - Despite the rapid and proven efficacy of topical corticosteroids, side-effects can limit their clinical usefulness. Topically active macrolide immunosuppressants such as ascomycin and tacrolimus appear to provide comparable therapeutic potency without significant local or adverse effects. Data from ongoing studies will be crucial in determining the safety of these agents in the long term, and also their place within the current therapeutic armamentarium available for patients with atopic dermatitis. Enzyme inhibitors of PLA2 and PDE?4 currently in the very early stages of clinical development also show potential promise as additional alternative strategies to topical treatment and may perhaps act as steroid sparing agents. Having been in the therapeutic doldrums for years, topical management of atopic dermatitis is likely to show great changes in the very near future.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Infection is one of the most significant complications following heart transplantation (HT). The aim of this study was to identify specific risk factors for early postoperative infections in HT recipients, and to develop a multivariable predictive model to identify HT recipients at high risk. Methods A single-center, observational, and retrospective study was conducted. The dependent variable was in-hospital postoperative infection. We examined demographic and epidemiological data from donors and recipients, surgical features, and adverse postoperative events as independent variables. Backwards, stepwise multivariable logistic regression with a P-value < 0.05 was used to identify clinical factors independently associated with the risk of in-hospital postoperative infections following HT. Results Six hundred seventy-seven patients were included in this study. During the in-hospital postoperative period, 348 episodes of infection were diagnosed in 239 (35.9%) patients. Seven variables were identified as independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT: history of diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and use of itraconazole. Based on the results of multivariable models, we constructed a 7-variable (8-point) score to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in HT recipients, which showed a reasonable ability to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in this population. Prospective external validation of this new score is warranted to confirm its clinical applicability. Conclusions In-hospital postoperative infection is a common complication after HT, affecting 35% of patients who underwent this procedure at our institution. Diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and itraconazole were all independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

Chondrotin sulphate in psoriasis -? Chondrotin sulphate in atherosclerosis -? Chondroitin sulphate in IBD -? Chondroitin sulphate in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) -? Other autoimmune diseases that may benefit from chondroitin sulphate ?? Conclusions Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and is formed by the 1?3 linkage of D-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine. In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 p (IL-1p)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 p and TNF-a, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a basis for understanding how and why hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may effectively treat severe autoimmune diseases (ADs) and describes the preclinical studies that have contributed to this understanding. It begins with an overview of how normal antigen-specific immune responses develop, followed by a discussion of why autoimmunity occurs. Thereafter, studies on preclinical models using HCT for the treatment of autoimmune syndromes are presented. The HCT studies are described as they were originally performed using congenic, syngeneic, or pseudoautologous donors with the understanding that all of these graft types serve as models for autologous HCT. ADs arise when immune effector cells cause damage to tissues. The response may be organ specific or systemic, and more than one autoimmune syndrome can exist in an individual. Depletion of host T cells is the most extensively studied mechanism by which allogeneic HCT can alter immune function.
