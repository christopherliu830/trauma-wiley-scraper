AB  - Abstract This review discusses how the measurement of proteins in blood and its components via quantitative proteomics analyses can inform health status. Various external and internal factors such as environmental conditions, genetic background, nutrition, diet, and lifestyle, chronic pathological conditions, disease state, or therapeutic intervention will be investigated and their effects on the protein profile will be shown. The resulting changes to ones? health and how this protein expression information can be used in early screening/diagnostic applications, drug discovery, precision treatment, patient management, and monitoring overall health status will also be presented.

AB  - Abstract The clinical application of the fetal membranes dates back to nearly a century. Their use has ranged from superficial skin dressings to surgical wound closure. The applications of the fetal membranes are constantly evolving, and key to this is the uncovering of multiple populations of stem and stem-like cells, each with unique properties that can be exploited for regenerative medicine. In addition to pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties of the stem and stem-like cells arising from the fetal membranes, the dehydrated and/or decellularized forms of the fetal membranes have been used to support the growth and function of other cells and tissues, including adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. This concise review explores the biological origin of the fetal membranes, a history of their use in medicine, and recent developments in the use of fetal membranes and their derived stem and stem-like cells in regenerative medicine.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.
