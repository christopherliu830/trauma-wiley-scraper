AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - Summary Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is an important clinical problem for cancer patients and survivors. In this review, we summarize studies investigating the occurrence of impaired cognition in patients with haematological malignancies. Most published studies focus on survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and primary central nervous system lymphoma. We also discuss studies conducted in acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-HL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although research in this area is still emerging, it appears that a subset of chemotherapy-treated haematological malignancy survivors experience CRCI. Future research should focus on expanding the literature reviewed here with larger studies appropriately powered to assess cognition via objective and subjective measures in a longitudinal fashion to tease apart the impact of disease and the various forms of cancer treatment.

AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.
