AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Abstract The effects of cell size, shape and deformability on cellular function have long been a topic of interest. Recently, mechanical phenotyping technologies capable of analysing large numbers of cells in real time have become available. This has important implications for biology and medicine, especially haemato-oncology and immunology, as immune cell mechanical phenotyping, immunologic function, and malignant cell transformation are closely linked and potentially exploitable to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the technologies used to analyse cellular mechanical properties and review emerging findings following the advent of high throughput deformability cytometry. We largely focus on cells from the myeloid lineage, which are derived from the bone marrow and include macrophages, granulocytes and erythrocytes. We highlight advances in mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension that are revealing novel signatures of human blood diseases and providing new insights into pathogenesis of these diseases. The contributions of mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension to our understanding of drug mechanisms, identification of novel therapeutics and monitoring of treatment efficacy particularly in instances of haematologic diseases are reviewed, and we suggest emerging topics of study to explore as high throughput deformability cytometers become prevalent in laboratories across the globe.

AB  - A 4-year-old German shorthaired pointer presented with collapse and hematochezia. Radiographs showed gas and fluid-distended small intestines and loss of serosal detail. Ultrasound examination showed hypomotile, fluid-distended small intestines, and thrombosed jejunal veins. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed and showed a CT ?whirl sign,? an important but nonspecific sign of intestinal volvulus in human patients. At surgery, the majority of the small intestine was entangled in the volvulus and showed black discoloration. The patient was euthanized. Postmortem evaluation yielded a diagnosis of jejunoileal mesenteric volvulus secondary to a congenital omphalomesenteric duct remnant.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Multivisceral resection (MVR) is potentially curative for selected gastric cancer patients, supposedly at the cost of increased complications. However, current data comparing MVR to standard gastrectomy (SG) is lacking. Objectives Compare complications and survival after MVR and SG. Methods In a retrospective cohort of 1015 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 58 underwent MVR and 466 SG. Groups were compared concerning their characteristics, complications, and survival. Results One hundred seventy-six patients had postoperative complications. Major complications were more frequent after MVR (P?=?.002). Surgical mortality was 8.6% and 4.9% for MVR and SG (P?=?.221). Older age, higher morbidities, and MVR were independent risk factors for major complications. The odds ratio for major complications was 5.89 for MVR with one or two organs and 38.01 for MVR with three or more organs. The pancreas was the most commonly removed organ and pT4b disease were confirmed in 34 (58.6%) of the MVR cases. Disease-free survival (DFS) was lower in MVR patients (51% vs 77.8%; P?<?.001), being worse according to the number of organs resected. In pN+ patients, DFS was worse after MVR. DFS was equivalent to pT4b and non-pT4b in the MVR group. Conclusions Increased morbidity and lower survival are expected for gastric cancer patients undergoing MVR.

AB  - Abstract Background The co-occurrence of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH; disorder characterized by proliferation of Langerhans cells) and Rosai?Dorfman disease (RDD; histiocytic entity that is one of the non-Langerhans cell diseases) is extremely rare and raises several questions regarding the nature of the diseases. Methods We describe a 10-year-old boy who presented with a 3-month history of right scalp swelling. Clinical, pathological, and imaging evaluation disclosed multiple LCH of bone and cutaneous RDD. Results After initiating prednisone and vinblastine therapy, the patient developed an asymptomatic diffuse papular eruption. Biopsy revealed cutaneous RDD. Treatment was continued with a good response of bone LCH and significant amelioration of the cutaneous findings. Conclusions Co-occurrence of LCH and RDD is a rare phenomenon. Various explanations, including the role of chemotherapy, are suggested based on our and several previously reported cases.
