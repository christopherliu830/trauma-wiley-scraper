AB  - The technique involving filtration of diluted blood enables the separate analysis of the flow properties of different cell subpopulations. This study was designed to assess the changes occurring in the flow properties and function of blood cells in stored bank blood and salvaged blood compared to patient blood in a given clinical situation. We measured hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils and the filterability, through 5??m Nucleopore filters, of isolated red blood cells and of diluted blood. Samples were obtained from patients undergoing aortic surgery and blood intended for transfusion: either salvaged during surgery or stored bank blood. Both salvaged and bank blood were much less filterable than patient blood, with reduced deformability of both red and white blood cells. However, salvaged blood contained highly activated neutrophils with a prolonged transit time of the ?fast-flowing? cells in the analysis compared to bank blood. Bank blood contained significantly more particles which acted as pore-blockers. Cells in bank and salvaged blood therefore have markedly abnormal flow and biochemical properties compared to patient blood.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether proinflammatory biomarkers are associated with frailty assessed according to functional status, mobility, mental health, and falls over 24 months. Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

AB  - Abstract We examined the effects of rifampicin on osteoblast-like cells derived from adult human bone in vitro. Cancellous bone was collected from five different individuals during elective orthopaedic operations and cultured in antibiotic-free media. Total DNA, 3H-thymidine incorporation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured after the cells were cultured for 4 days in media containing concentrations of rifampicin ranging from 0 to 1000 ?/ml. Mean total DNA was decreased at concentrations of 10 ?/ml and above in the cultures obtained from four out of five individuals but these decreases were significant in the cultures from only two individuals. 3H-thymidine incorporation, a more sensitive indicator of change in cell proliferation, and ALP activity were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in all of the cultures containing 3 and 7 ?g/ml, respectively. In the clinical setting, serum concentrations of rifampicin often exceed 10 ?g/ml after systemic administration. The present study has shown that rifampicin, at these concentrations, can inhibit the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells in vitro. Further studies should be carried out to assess whether rifampicin is detrimental to the bone repair process in vivo. ? 2001 Orthopaedic Research Society. Punlished by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Summary For the critically ill patient, initiation of early enteral nutrition is an important therapeutic strategy which can change their course of hospitalization. If started soon after admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and if provided with sufficient dosage, early EN can be expected to reduce infectious morbidity, decrease risk for multiorgan failure, and shorten ICU and hospital length of stay (compared to parenteral nutrition or standard therapy with no nutrition support). Obstacles to delivery of EN should be avoided, risk for gut ischemia should be carefully differentiated from clinical ileus, and use of gastric residual volume should not be misinterpreted as an effective deterrent against aspiration pneumonia. The gastroenterologist /endoscopist has a number of innate skills to bring to the table for the provision of EN. If partnered with a nurse or clinical dietitian, such a combination of talent can lead to a highly effective nutrition support team.

AB  - Abstract A novel allergy vaccine (Pollinex? Quattro) has been developed for the prevention or relief of allergic symptoms caused by a variety of pollens. Within this range, the grass pollen allergy vaccine contains extracts of 12 grass pollens and rye cereal (all chemically modi?ed by glutaraldehyde) that are adsorbed onto l-tyrosine with addition of the immunostimulatory adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL?). A speci?c preclinical safety testing strategy was developed to support clinical use, comprising single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies. Dose levels of up to 0.5 ml per animal (mouse) and up to 1.0 ml per animal (rat and rabbit) were used with vaccines containing 2000 or 12 000 standardized units (SU) ml?1 of grass pollen allergoids, 50 µg ml?1 of MPL? adjuvant and 20 mg ml?1 of tyrosine. Overall, the product showed no toxicological ?ndings of signi?cance at levels greatly in excess of those proposed for clinical use. A not unexpected, but relatively minor, immunostimulatory effect was seen following repeated dosing (once weekly for 3 weeks) at 1.0 ml per rat. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Alopecia may occur anywhere on the body of guinea pigs. Skin scrapings, biopsies, histopathology, special histologic staining, and fungal or microbiologic culturing are all suitable ancillary techniques for determining an etiologic basis for suspected infectious causes of alopecia in guinea pigs. Animal housing and management practices should be evaluated closely in simple cases of alopecia, looking for potential sources of abrasions or rough surfaces in which hair may be caught. Adequacy of diet should be ascertained, particularly with respect to vitamin C content. There are few published reports of neurologic disorders in guinea pigs. Head tilt, circling, and head shaking may be seen with bacterial infections of the middle and inner ear. Cataracts with or without nuclear sclerosis are common findings in guinea pigs and may invol.

AB  - Objective:? To determine point and annual prevalence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Setting:? Reported prevalence of RAS in textbooks and much of the literature varies according to study location, patient selection and whether point prevalence (presence of lesions at examination) or period prevalence (history of lesions during a specified period) is reported. Many studies are based on non-probability samples and this may contribute to significant variation in reported prevalence and factors presumed to be associated with RAS. Methods:? We analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988?1994, a large United States probability sample, for RAS and covariates suggested in the literature using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results:? Oral mucosal examinations were performed on 17?235 adults 17?years and older. Of these, 146 (0.89%) had at least one clinically apparent aphthous lesion. For annual (reported) prevalence, Whites (20.87%) and Mexican-Americans (12.88%) had several fold higher prevalence of RAS than Blacks (4.96%). Adults younger than 40?years of age had almost twice the prevalence (22.54%) of those older than 40?years (13.42%). Conclusion:? Annual prevalence was significantly higher in whites and Mexican-Americans (compared with blacks), individuals 17?39?years of age, cigarette non-smokers, and those with recurrent herpes labialis history; while it was lower in males. Point prevalence was significantly higher in whites, Mexican-American, individuals 17?39?years of age, cigarette non-smokers, and males.

AB  - Abstract:? Tracheobronchomalacia and excessive dynamic airway collapse are two separate forms of dynamic central airway obstruction that may or may not coexist. These entities are increasingly recognized as asthma and COPD imitators. The understanding of these disease processes, however, has been compromised over the years because of uncertainties regarding their definitions, pathogenesis and aetiology. To date, there is no standardized classification, diagnosis or management algorithm. In this article we comprehensively review the aetiology, morphopathology, physiology, diagnosis and treatment of these entities.
