AB  - While ex situ conservation programs of juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758), before release to natural habitats, have been conducted in several countries, the optimal-stocking density for husbandry has not yet been reported. The optimization of stocking density was the main purpose of this study. The 15-day-old post-hatching turtles (29.30?±?0.05?g body weight) were reared in round fiberglass tanks at various stocking densities including 20 turtles/m3 (20TM), 40 turtles/m3 (40TM), 60 turtles/m3 (60TM), and 80 turtles/m3 (80TM), over an 8-week trial. Water quality, survival, growth performance, feed utilization, aggressive behavior, fecal digestive enzymes, and hematological parameters were compared between the treatments, and were used as indicators of a successful captive rearing program. The water quality across the four treatments was in the standard range, but a high-stocking density reduced the quality significantly. No mortality was observed in any treatment group. Superior growth and feed utilization were only observed with the 40TM treatment, relative to the others (P?<?0.05). The turtles in this group had no aggressive behavior, as indicated by observing hind limb biting. This treatment manipulated the level of proteolytic activity of pepsin and trypsin in response to density stressor, but not amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsin. The 40TM treatment also maintained the hematological characteristics, indicating no negative effects on health status. Overall, the findings indicate that the captivity program of post-hatching turtles at 40 turtles/m3 is the preferred option in their head-started propagation, as well as in public displays in zoos or aquaria.

AB  - Abstract:? Tracheobronchomalacia and excessive dynamic airway collapse are two separate forms of dynamic central airway obstruction that may or may not coexist. These entities are increasingly recognized as asthma and COPD imitators. The understanding of these disease processes, however, has been compromised over the years because of uncertainties regarding their definitions, pathogenesis and aetiology. To date, there is no standardized classification, diagnosis or management algorithm. In this article we comprehensively review the aetiology, morphopathology, physiology, diagnosis and treatment of these entities.

AB  - Alemtuzumab was used as an induction agent in 205 renal transplant recipients undergoing 207 living donor renal transplants. All donor kidneys were recovered laparoscopically. Postoperatively, patients were treated with tacrolimus monotherapy, and immunosuppression was weaned when possible. Forty-seven recipients of living donor renal transplants prior to the induction era who received conventional triple drug immunosuppression without antibody induction served as historic controls. The mean follow-up was 493 days in the alemtuzumab group and 2101 days in the historic control group. Actuarial 1-year patient and graft survival were 98.6% and 98.1% in the alemtuzumab group, compared to 93.6% and 91.5% in the control group, respectively. The incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR) at 1 year was 6.8% in the alemtuzumab group and 17.0% (p < 0.05) in the historic control group. Most (81.3%) episodes of ACR in the alemtuzumab group were Banff 1 (a or b) and were sensitive to steroid pulses for the treatment of rejection. There was no cytomegalovirus disease or infection. The incidence of delayed graft function was 0%, and the incidence of posttransplant insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was 0.5%. This study represents the largest series to date of live donor renal transplant recipients undergoing alemtuzumab induction, and confirms the short-term safety and efficacy of this approach.

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Abstract Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is an uncommon entity and challenging to distinguish from breast carcinoma, both clinically and upon imaging. Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) is a histologically distinct GM with clear ?cystic? spaces (CS) surrounded by neutrophils and may contain Gram-positive bacilli (such as Corynebacterium species). Cytologic features of GM, in particular CNGM, on ThinPrep (TP), are limited. We reviewed the cytological features of GM with a special focus on CNGM on TP. Ten cases with a concurrent/recent FNA and histologic diagnosis of GM or CNGM, or positive culture for Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, were identified over an 11-y period (2007-2017). A double-blinded review of the TP slides was performed by two independent cytopathologists. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Six cases were histologically proven CNGM and 1 FNA only case had a positive culture for C. kroppenstedtii. Three had a histological diagnosis of GM. TP from the 7 CNGM cases demonstrated CS, including 1 case with a cellblock (CB) study showing well-formed clear CS, while none of the non-CNGM cases had CS (P?= .01). Bacteria were identified within CS in 5 of 7 cases of CNGM. Multinucleated giant cells, granulomas, histiocytes, and neutrophils were variably observed. All histologically confirmed cases of CNGM showed distinct CS on TP. Cellblock study is a valuable adjunct to evaluate CNGM and for ancillary studies. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, our findings necessitate the need for studies with a larger cohort.

AB  - A case of generalized eruptive histiocytoma (GEH) was evaluated and examined histopathologically and ultrastructurally. A 24-year-old male had an episode of high fever and drug-induced eruption prior to the appearance of multiple skin lesions. Uniform, red to dark-red papular lesions appeared on his cheeks and then became generalized. The lesions were composed of a massive dermal infiltrate of histiocytes, which had oval nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contained unique annular structures, myeloid bodies and vacuoles. The specificity of these structures is as yet unknown. Reactive stimulation rather than neoplastic proliferation may be a causative factor in GEH.

AB  - Free-living amebae are ubiquitous in our environment, but rarely cause cutaneous infection. Balamuthia mandrillaris has a predilection for infecting skin of the central face. Infection may be restricted to the skin or associated with life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We report a case of a 91-year-old woman, who presented with a non-healing red plaque over her right cheek. Several punch biopsies exhibited non-specific granulomatous inflammation without demonstrable fungi or mycobacteria in histochemical stains. She was treated empirically for granulomatous rosacea, but the lesion continued to progress. A larger incisional biopsy was performed in which amebae were observed in hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. These were retrospectively apparent in the prior punch biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction studies identified the organisms as Balamuthia mandrillaris. Cutaneous infection by B. mandrillaris is a rare condition that is sometimes complicated by life-threatening CNS involvement and which often evades timely diagnosis due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations. Moreover, these amebae are easily overlooked in histopathologic sections because of their small number and their resemblance to histiocytes. Dermatopathologists should be familiar with the histopathologic appearance of these organisms and include balamuthiasis and other amebic infections in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.
