AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Breeding season is the most energetically and physiologically demanding phase in the avian annual cycle, challenging adults' physiology and survival. However, the timing and extent that self-maintenance of breeding adults is compromised during the breeding season is poorly understood. We investigated the trade-off between reproduction and self-maintenance in relation to breeding phase (prelaying, incubation, chick rearing) and sex in a small Arctic seabird, the little auk Alle alle. To measure a bird's allocation of time for self-maintenance, we examined size-adjusted body mass and immunocompetence expressed by bacteria (Escherichia coli) killing capacity (BKC) of blood plasma, heterophils/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) and their numbers of particular leucocytes per 10 000 red blood cells (RBC). We found that size-adjusted body mass decreased as the breeding season progressed. BKC, number of heterophils and H/L values were all was significantly higher at prelaying when compared to all other phases. Interestingly, we found that heavier individuals had higher BKC and number heterophils at the prelaying and chick rearing phases than light individuals. There were no differences by sex in any studied variables. Our results indicate that immunocompetence and body mass of breeding adults decreases over the course of breeding season. The efficiency of the immune system appears to be dependent on the bird's body reserves. Our results suggest that little auks allocation of resources into reproduction negatively affects their self-maintenance.

AB  - Background The magnitude of the systemic response is proportional to the degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and open procedures. In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open procedures, resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or open procedures on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection.

AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary Coagulation and innate immunity are linked evolutionary processes that orchestrate the host defence against invading pathogens and injury. The complement system is integral to innate immunity and shares numerous interactions with components of the haemostatic pathway, helping to maintain physiological equilibrium. The term ?immunothrombosis? was introduced in 2013 to embrace this process, and has become an area of much recent interest. What is less apparent in the literature however is an appreciation of the clinical manifestations of the coagulation-complement interaction and the consequences of dysregulation of either system, as seen in many inflammatory and thrombotic disease states, such as sepsis, trauma, atherosclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and some thrombotic microangiopathies to name a few. The growing appreciation of this immunothrombotic phenomenon will foster the drive for novel therapies in these disease states, including anticoagulants as immunomodulators and targeted molecular therapies.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive survey is provided on the application of a random positioning machine (RPM) for studies on gravitational effects on mammalian cells. The RPM is suitable to simulate microgravity conditions and allows performing a high number of on-ground experiments wherein mammalian cells are exposed to reduced gravity. Most of these experiments have been performed either to prove or extend observations made during spaceflights or to develop and prepare new spaceflight experiments. They did not only bring a tremendous number of observations, but they helped to elucidate three dominant cellular pathways that are affected by weightlessness. The apoptotic, the immune-activating and the bone differentiation pathways are discussed.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength due to excessive loss of bone protein and mineral content. The imbalance between osteogenesis by osteoblasts and osteoclastogenesis by osteoclasts contributes to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Estrogen withdrawal leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Overactivated osteoclasts by inflammation play a vital role in the imbalance. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus with various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Here we demonstrate that matrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vivo with decreased serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-Î±, and IL-6. In vitro matrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator for NF-?B ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF in bone marrow monocytes and RAW264.7 cells as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption through pit formation assays. For molecular mechanisms, matrine abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-?B, AKT, and MAPK pathways and suppressed osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, TRAP, C-Src, and cathepsin K. Our study demonstrates that matrine inhibits osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and that matrine is a promising agent in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases such as osteoporosis.?Chen, X., Zhi, X., Pan, P., Cui, J., Cao, L., Weng, W., Zhou, Q., Wang, L., Zhai, X.

The Japanese Red Cross analysed the results of questionnaires sent in 1993 regarding post-transfusion graft-vs.-host disease (PT-GVHD) from hospitals; the majority of patients with PT-GVHD in 1993 were transfused for cardiovascular or cancer surgery, and about 10 patients had died yearly from PT-GVHD in the following few years. The Japan Society of Blood Transfusion (JSBT) organized a subcommittee for the prevention of PT-GVHD, and issued a fourth version of guidelines for the irradiation of blood to prevent PT-GVHD. These guidelines recommended transfusion of irradiated blood for cardiosurgery, cancer surgery, elderly recipients and severe trauma, as well as congenital immunodeficient recipients, newborn infants and other immunocompromised patients. Also recommended was irradiation not only of blood within 72?h after collection but also of blood stored for 14?days. Reported PT-GVHD has diminished to a few cases in recent years.

AB  - Summary Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is the principal inductive site for mucosal immune responses that are capable of T and B cell responses and antigen-specific responses. In previous independent studies different structures of MALT, e.g. bronchus-, larynx- and nose-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT, LALT, NALT) have been described separately in various frequencies in the human respiratory tract over life spans. Because upper respiratory tract infections are common in infants, dysregulations of mucosal immune responses might be seriously involved in the aetiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the present study the coincidental occurrence of the three different MALT structures in the respiratory tract within the same patients were studied, and cases of SIDS and children who had died from different traumatic and natural causes of death (non-SIDS) were compared. First, the frequency of BALT and LALT in 46 children (35 SIDS, 11 non-SIDS) with or without NALT were examined. A tendency was found of a coincidence of respiratory MALT structures. In 50 additional cases of infant death (30 SIDS, 20 non-SIDS) from the multi-centric German Study on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (GeSID) where death had occurred in the first year of life, the coincidence was evaluated. A coincidental occurrence of BALT, LALT and NALT or BALT and LALT (each about 30%) was found in both groups, whereby the coincidence in SIDS and the control patients did not differ. Interestingly, the children with coincidental MALT were strikingly older, supporting the hypothesis of respiratory MALT formation via environmental stimulation over time.

AB  - Abstract The neurovascular unit (NVU) is the most important biological barrier between vascular districts and central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, which maintains brain homeostasis, protects the CNS from pathogens penetration, and mediates neuroimmune communication. T lymphocytes migration across the blood?brain barrier is heavily affected in different brain diseases, representing a major target for novel drug development. In vitro models of NVU could represent a primary tool to investigate the molecular events occurring at this interface. To move toward the establishment of personalized therapies, a patient-related NVU-model is set, incorporating human primary astrocytes integrated into a microfluidic platform. The model is morphologically and functionally characterized, proving to be an advantageous tool to investigate human T lymphocytes transmigration and thus the efficacy of potential novel drugs affecting this process.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration â‰¥60?Âµmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Abstract Retrospective studies of the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and colorectal cancer recurrence are reviewed. Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with preoperative anemia, operations for rectal carcinoma, presence of tumor in the right colon, prolonged procedures, and copious blood loss. Control for variables related to blood transfusion and potentially affecting disease recurrence?blood loss, duration of surgery, and magnitude of the procedure?was notably absent from the majority of studies. None of the negative studies had sufficient numbers of both transfused and untransfused patients to reject the hypothesis that blood transfusion is associated with cancer recurrence with statistical validity. No concensus emerged regarding the significance of blood transfusion for the patient with colorectal cancer, and no recommendations concerning the use of blood are justified on the basis of these studies.

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which areÂ dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) adversely affects more or less all immune competent cells. Nonspecific immunity is impaired, particularly adherence and chemotaxis of phagocytes, although the responsiveness of circulating cells may not be the same as that of noncirculating cells. PCM results in numerical and functional impairment in lymphocytes. PCM markedly affects IgG class antibodies which have the highest affinity when directed against T-dependent antigens. These impairments are interrelated, since cooperation between T-helper cell and B-cells is depressed, and the antigen presentation to T-helper cells by macrophages is deficient.

AB  - Chronic painful Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common disorder among athletes. Sclerotherapy (ST) and prolotherapy (PT) are two promising options among the numerous other conservative therapies. As their efficacy and potential adverse effects (AE) are still unclear, we systematically searched, analyzed, and synthesized the available literature on ST and PT for treating AT. Electronic databases, Google Scholar and articles? reference lists were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were set up according to the PICOS-scheme including human and animal studies. Three authors independently reviewed the results and evaluated methodological quality (Coleman Methodology Score and Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment). The initial search yielded 1104 entries. After screening, 18 articles were available for qualitative synthesis, six of which were subjected to meta-analysis. The mean Coleman Score of the 13 human studies was 50. Four RCTs were ranked as having a low risk of selection bias. Three of those reported a statistically significant drop in the visual analog scale (VAS) score, one a significant increase in the VISA-A Score. 12 of 13 human studies reported positive results in achieving pain relief and patient satisfaction, whereas only one study's finding differed. Meta-analysis revealed an unambiguous result in favor of the intervention (weighted mean difference D=?4.67Â cm, 95% CI ?5.56 to ?3.76Â cm [P<.001]). Only one serious AE and two minor AEs were reported in the entire literature. This systematic review suggests that ST and PT may be effective treatment options for AT and that they can be considered safe. Long-term studies and RCTs are still needed to support their recommendation.

AB  - We report a case of inflammatory stage vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicans (LSA) with histopathologic features simulating both patch stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and extramammary Paget?s disease. The patient is a 79-year-old woman with an erythematous plaque on her vulva. A punch biopsy was performed that revealed mild psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis with spongiosis, marked interface vacuolar alteration, scattered individual necrotic keratinocytes and Civatte bodies. A band-like mixed inflammatory infiltrate was present in the papillary/upper dermis with prominent intraepidermal lymphocytes. Some intraepidermal lymphocytes showed atypical nuclear contours simulating the cells seen in MF. The presence of numerous intraepidermal epithelioid cells with a pagetoid distribution raised the possibility of extramammary Paget?s disease. A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains showed a reactive lichenoid mixed population of lymphocytes with numerous intraepidermal Langerhans cells. This confirmed the diagnosis of the inflammatory stage of lichen sclerosus. The presence of prominent epithelioid Langerhans cells with activated small lymphocytes represents an immune response in LSA and could cause diagnostic confusion with neoplastic conditions. IHC staining can confirm cell type and rule out MF and extramammary Paget?s disease.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To evaluate the efficacy of silk fibroin scaffolds (SFS) and acellular collagen scaffolds (ACS) for the repair of tympanic membrane (TM) in a guinea pig acute perforation model. Study Design Experimental animal research. Methods Seventy-two albino guinea pigs underwent perforation of the right TM and were divided into four experimental groups (n = 18). The perforations were repaired with SFS, ACS, and paper patch using onlay myringoplasty, or they were allowed to heal spontaneously (control). An additional group of 10 guinea pigs without perforation or scaffold was allocated as a normal TM group. Guinea pigs in each experimental group (n = 6) were evaluated at 7, 14, and 28 days following surgery. TM structural healing was evaluated by otomicroscopy and histology, and functional hearing was analyzed by auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Prior to the study, mechanical properties of SFS and ACS were investigated. Results Tensile strength and elasticity of SFS and ACS were within the known range for human TM. Based on otologic and histologic evaluation, TMs treated with SFS or ACS showed complete closure of the perforation at an earlier stage, with a trilaminar structure and more uniform thickness compared to paper patch and control treated groups. ABR assessment demonstrated that SFS or ACS treatment facilitated a faster restoration of hearing function compared to paper patch and control groups. Conclusion The results of this study show that SFS and ACS are effective graft materials and may be utilized as alternatives to current grafts for TM repair. Level of Evidence N/A.

AB  - Summary Aluminium intoxication in renal failure occurred over weeks or months when dialysis fluid or parenteral solutions were heavily contaminated and over many years when the main source was oral administration of aluminium-containing phosphate binders. Encephalopathy was common during subacute intoxication but in slow aluminium poisoning the main brunt was borne by the bones. However, in both tempos of intoxication several organs or systems were involved. Encephalopathy was usually accompanied by bone disease, bone disease by parathyroid suppression and both by anaemia. The heart and the lymphocytes are probably damaged by aluminium overload. Among the many questions left unanswered 15 years after the incrimination of aluminium as the cause of this multi-system illness are: (1) does low level aluminium overload in renal failure cause gradual deterioration in cerebral function? And, if so, (2) does it resemble Alzheimer's disease or a slow-onset version of dialysis encephalopathy? The evidence we review suggests that the answer to (1) is ?yes? and to (2) ?probably the latter?.

AB  - SUMMARY A 43-year-old Maori man presented with a 1 month history of malaise, weight loss, anorexia, arthralgia, recurrent fever and tender erythematous subcutaneous skin lesions. Histological examination of an incisional biopsy of a lesion revealed a lobular panniculitis with an inflammatory infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and evidence of cytophagocytosis consistent with a diagnosis of subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The systemic symptoms and skin lesions resolved spontaneously within 3 weeks, only to recur 2 months later, requiring treatment with oral prednisolone. T-cell gene rearrangement studies demonstrated a monoclonal T-cell receptor (?-chain) gene rearrangement, further supporting the diagnosis of subcutaneous panniculitic T-cell lymphoma. Treatment with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) led to remission of symptoms. Four months after completing chemotherapy, the patient remained asymptomatic with a few indurated subcutaneous plaques on the chest. Biopsy of these areas revealed lobular panniculitis, lymphocytic infiltrate without cytological atypia, abundant lipophages and fibrosis and sclerosis consistent with a healing response. He remains well 24 months following chemotherapy.

AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.
