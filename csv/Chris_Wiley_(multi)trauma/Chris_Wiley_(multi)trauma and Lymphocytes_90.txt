AB  - Abstract Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is an uncommon entity and challenging to distinguish from breast carcinoma, both clinically and upon imaging. Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) is a histologically distinct GM with clear ?cystic? spaces (CS) surrounded by neutrophils and may contain Gram-positive bacilli (such as Corynebacterium species). Cytologic features of GM, in particular CNGM, on ThinPrep (TP), are limited. We reviewed the cytological features of GM with a special focus on CNGM on TP. Ten cases with a concurrent/recent FNA and histologic diagnosis of GM or CNGM, or positive culture for Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, were identified over an 11-y period (2007-2017). A double-blinded review of the TP slides was performed by two independent cytopathologists. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Six cases were histologically proven CNGM and 1 FNA only case had a positive culture for C. kroppenstedtii. Three had a histological diagnosis of GM. TP from the 7 CNGM cases demonstrated CS, including 1 case with a cellblock (CB) study showing well-formed clear CS, while none of the non-CNGM cases had CS (P?= .01). Bacteria were identified within CS in 5 of 7 cases of CNGM. Multinucleated giant cells, granulomas, histiocytes, and neutrophils were variably observed. All histologically confirmed cases of CNGM showed distinct CS on TP. Cellblock study is a valuable adjunct to evaluate CNGM and for ancillary studies. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, our findings necessitate the need for studies with a larger cohort.

AB  - A case of generalized eruptive histiocytoma (GEH) was evaluated and examined histopathologically and ultrastructurally. A 24-year-old male had an episode of high fever and drug-induced eruption prior to the appearance of multiple skin lesions. Uniform, red to dark-red papular lesions appeared on his cheeks and then became generalized. The lesions were composed of a massive dermal infiltrate of histiocytes, which had oval nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contained unique annular structures, myeloid bodies and vacuoles. The specificity of these structures is as yet unknown. Reactive stimulation rather than neoplastic proliferation may be a causative factor in GEH.

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this review is to discuss the clinical utility of stem cells in periodontal regeneration by reviewing relevant literature that assesses the periodontal-regenerative potential of stem cells. We consider and describe the main stem cell populations that have been utilized with regard to periodontal regeneration, including bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the main dental-derived mesenchymal stem cell populations: periodontal ligament stem cells, dental pulp stem cells, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, stem cells from apical papilla and dental follicle precursor cells. Research into the use of stem cells for tissue regeneration has the potential to significantly influence periodontal treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract Tissue diagnosis of a soft tissue neoplasm is of paramount importance for the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Biopsy technique including approach and biopsy method is important to the success of diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Histologic and cytologic diagnoses are difficult and complicated by the large number of soft tissue lesions described, distinctly different biopotential for morphologically similar lesions, often small biopsy specimen size, and the generally limited experience many pathologists have in the diagnosis of soft tissue neoplasms. While utilized less frequently than core-needle biopsies, fine-needle aspiration is a valuable initial approach for the classification of soft tissue neoplasms. The combination of pattern based morphologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics represents a utilitarian and generally successful approach for the diagnosis of soft tissue lesions.

An unusual manifestation of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in the lip after pediatric heart transplantation. ?Pediatr Transplantation 2012. ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? PTLD is a serious and frequently observed complication after solid organ transplantation. We present a six-yr-old girl with a rapidly growing, solid tumor of the lip four?yr after orthotopic heart transplantation, which was classified as monomorphic PTLD with the characteristics of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment with reduction in immunosuppression, ganciclovir, and anti B-cell monoclonal antibody (rituximab) resulted in full remission since 12?months. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first description of PTLD in the lip in a pediatric patient after heart transplantation in the English literature.
