AB  - Abstract In this study, a novel antibiotic carrier system for use in the treatment of implant-related and chronic osteomyelitis was developed. Sulbactam-cefoperazone was introduced to rods of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate (22 mol % HV, w/w), a member of a family of microbial-origin polymer that is biodegradable, biocompatible, and osteoconductive due to its piezoelectric property. The antibiotic-loaded carrier was implanted into the infection site that was induced by Staphylococcus aureus inoculation into the rabbit tibia. The effectiveness of this was assessed macroscopically, radiographically, bacteriologically, and histopathologically. Findings of infection subsided on day 15 and almost complete remission was observed on day 30. The control side that contained antibiotic-free rods, however, worsened. These findings prompted us to conclude that the novel biodegradable antibiotic carrier developed in the present study seems to be a promising candidate for use in the treatment of severe bone infection. ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The blood-brain barrier is a gatekeeper and modulatory interface for the CNS. Cerebral endothelial cells are the major component of the blood-brain barrier, and they modify inflammatory signals from the circulation to the CNS by production and secretion of secondary substances. The inflammatory mediators induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) were determined by microarray analysis of RBE4 cerebral endothelial cells, at 0, 6, 12, or 24?h after TNF treatment. Interleukin (IL)-15 and its receptors were among the most robustly up-regulated genes. This was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. The three subunits of the IL15 receptor complex (IL15Rα, IL2R?, and IL2R?) showed differential regulation by TNF in their time course and amplitude of increased expression. Consistent with increased expression of the specific high affinity receptor IL15Rα, TNF increased cellular uptake of 125I-IL15 and enhanced the fluorescent intensity of Alexa568-IL15 in RBE4 cells. TNF treatment in mice also increased the level of expression of IL15 receptors in enriched cerebral microvessels. We conclude that the cerebral microvascular IL15 system is a novel inflammatory mediator that transduces the actions of TNF.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - In an effort to identify variables that could be used to predict outcomes of amputation, a cohort of 97 veteran amputees with a median age of 64 years who underwent 155 lower extremity procedures during 1984 was followed for 15 months. A high incidence of postoperative complication, revision, and mortality with poor quality of life confirm the serious prognosis of these individuals. Regression analyses indicated that peripheral vascular disease and prolonged preoperative hospitalization were associated with complications. Preoperative gangrene and peripheral vascular disease were associated with the need for revision. Complications, a low body mass index, and multiple diseases were related to death. Those with multiple diseases and extensive atherosclerosis were less likely to walk. Ability to perform activities of daily living was the most important predictor of quality of life. Patients at higher risk for these adverse outcomes need to be identified early in their hospital stay. The involvement of the patient or his or her surrogate in decisions regarding the course of treatment and the level of amputation is essential.

AB  - Abstract Background: Although surgical resection remains the central element in curative treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, increasing emphasis and resource has been focused on neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Developments in these modalities have improved outcomes, but far less attention has been paid to improving oncological outcomes through optimization of perioperative care. Methods: A narrative review is presented based on available and updated literature in English and the authors' experience with enhanced recovery research. Results: A range of perioperative factors (such as lifestyle, co-morbidity, anaemia, sarcopenia, medications, regional analgesia and minimal access surgery) are modifiable, and can be optimized to reduce short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, improve functional capacity and quality of life, and possibly improve oncological outcome. The effect on cancer-free and overall survival may be of equal magnitude to that achieved by many adjuvant oncological regimens. Modulation of core factors, such as nutritional status, systemic inflammation, and surgical and disease-mediated stress, probably influences the host's immune surveillance and defence status both directly and through reduced postoperative morbidity. Conclusion: A wider view on long-term effects of expanded or targeted enhanced recovery protocols is warranted. Copyright ? 2012 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 368?376 The spread of HIV continues unabated in the most vulnerable populations of the world. HIV prevention methods, such as a vaginal microbicide, a mucosal vaccine, pre-exposure prophylaxis or a vaccine, are urgently needed in the fight against new infections. We must make a commitment to supporting innovative research and product design, so that one or more of these products provide a halt to the spread of HIV. Above all, these products should be proven to be safe and not negatively disturb the local immune system in a way that facilitates or enhances heterosexual transmission of HIV. HIV specific and non specific cellular and humoral local vaginal immunity must be assessed in clinical trials when testing prevention products for safety or efficacy. A proven, well-documented and standardized sampling strategy will provide high quality data to be able to assess both safety and local immune responses. In this paper, we will discuss methods for vaginal immunology sampling in the context of clinical trials.

AB  - Summary Abnormal teeth in young animals may occur for many reasons ? some are genetic but others are acquired. This chapter discusses primary hereditary disorders, spontaneous anomalies of unknown cause, and dental alterations due to extrinsic factors. In addition to clinical information regarding the appearance and condition of the teeth and dental radiographic findings, a thorough evaluation of the history is often required to establish the cause of odontogenic anomalies. The chapter also covers several of the more common equine dental diseases and a few dental pathologies unique to equids. Pulpitis is one of the pathologic processes for which a pathologist may be called upon to examine a tooth histologically. Chronic degenerative changes may occur in injured teeth in the absence of pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Typical inflammatory responses, such as edema and active congestion, may increase pressure within the pulp chamber and thereby exacerbate pulpal injury through ischemia.
