AB  - The crystal structure of l-α-glutamine has been elucidated at room temperature at pressures between 0 and 4.9?GPa by using single-crystal high-pressure X-ray diffraction techniques. The structure is primarily stabilized by five N?H...O intermolecular interactions, which link molecules in a herringbone-like layer arrangement, giving rise to voids within the solid. The application of pressure on the structure results in a reduction in the size of the voids, as a consequence of the shortening of the N?H...O hydrogen bonds, which compress to minimum N...O distances of around 2.6?Å, without driving the crystal structure to a phase transition. The decrease in the hydrogen-bond distances is due to the necessary stabilization of the structure, which arises from molecules modifying their positions to optimize electrostatic contacts and minimize the occupied space. Hirshfeld surfaces and fingerprint plots have been used to rapidly assess the structural changes that occur on application of pressure.

AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.

AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Lack of an accepted definition for ?high immunological risk? hampers individualization of immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation. For recipient-related risk factors for acute rejection, the most compelling evidence points to younger age and African American ethnicity. Recipient gender, body mass, previous transplantation, and concomitant infection or disease do not appear to be influential. Deceased donation now has only a minor effect on rejection risk, but older donor age remains a significant predictor. Conventional immunological markers (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] mismatching, pretransplant anti-HLA alloantibodies, and panel reactive antibodies) are being reassessed in light of growing understanding about the role of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). At the time of transplant, delayed graft function is one of the most clear-cut risk factors for acute rejection. Extended cold ischemia time (≥24 h) may also play a contributory role. While it is not yet possible to establish conclusively the relative contribution of different risk factors for acute rejection after kidney transplantation, the available data point to variables that should be taken into account at the time of transplant. Together, these offer a realistic basis for planning an appropriate immunosuppression regimen in individual patients.

Abstract Aims: We investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. Material and Methods: Twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. We recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 (the ?induction phase?), and at Day 21, Day 25, Day 30 and Day 35 in the other half (the ?resolution phase?). RNA was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus2.0 microarrays. Paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. Gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. Results: The median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at Day 21 and 1 at Day 35. Differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. Leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. Conclusions: Transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The majority of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma have irresectable disease and require palliation with biliary stenting to alleviate symptoms and prevent biliary sepsis. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have proved ineffective, but recent studies suggest photodynamic therapy (PDT) may improve the outlook for these patients. This prospective clinical cohort study has evaluated the efficacy of radical curative surgery, standard palliative therapy (stent ± chemotherapy) and a novel palliative therapy (stent ± Photofrin-PDT) in 50 consecutive patients treated for hilar cholangiocarcinoma over a 5-year period. Methods:? Between January 2002 and December 2006, 50 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were evaluated for treatment. Ten patients were considered suitable for curative resection (Cohort 1). Forty patients with irresectable disease were stratified into Cohort 2 ? Stent ± chemotherapy (n= 17); and Cohort 3 ? Stent ± PDT (n= 23). Prospective follow-up in all patients and data collected for morbidity, mortality and overall patient survival. Results:? The median age was 68 years [range 44?83]. Positive cytology/histology was obtained in 28/50 (56%). One death in Cohort 1 occurred at 145 days after surgical resection. No treatment related-deaths occurred in Cohort 2 or 3, chemotherapy-induced morbidity in three patients in cohort 2, PDT-induced morbidity in 11 patients in cohort 3. Actual 1-year survival was 80%, 12% and 75% in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Mean survival after resection was 1278 days (median survival not reached). Mean and median survival was 173 and 169 days, respectively, in Cohort 2; and 512 and 425 days in Cohort 3. Patient survival was significantly longer in cohorts 1 and 3 (P < 0.0001; Log rank test). Conclusion:? This prospective clinical cohort study has demonstrated that radical surgery and palliative Photofrin-PDT are associated with an increased survival in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
