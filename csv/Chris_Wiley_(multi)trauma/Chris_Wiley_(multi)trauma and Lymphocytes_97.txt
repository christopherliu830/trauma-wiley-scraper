AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.

AB  - Epithelial cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice, most usually as epidermoid (infundibular) cysts, and trichilemmal (pilar) cysts. A multitude of other cystic structures can arise from the pilosebaceous unit, including dermoid cyst, pilonidal cyst, eruptive vellus hair cyst, steatocystoma, pilomatricoma, as well as eccrine and apocrine hydrocystoma. Epidermoid cysts are thought to derive from the follicular infundibulum, and express keratin 10 but not keratin 17, whereas trichilemmal cysts are believed to derive from the follicular isthmus, and express both keratins 10 and 17. Proliferating follicular cysts generally exhibit trichilemmal keratinization. In addition to the various aforementioned cysts, hybrid cysts have been reported. The majority of hybrid cysts described have been epidermoid-trichilemmal, in which the upper portion of the cyst shows epidermoid keratinization with a sharp transition inferiorly to trichilemmal keratinization. However other hybrid variants have been reported, including epidermoid-pilomatricoma, epidermoid-apocrine hydrocystoma, trichilemmal-pilomatricoma, eruptive vellus hair cyst-steatocystoma, and eruptive vellus hair cyst-trichilemmal cysts. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a proliferating hybrid cyst containing both epidermoid and trichilemmal components, which presented on the scrotum of a 44-year-old man.

AB  - Spitzoid melanoma in children is a rare tumor that can mimic Spitz nevus both clinically and histologically. Recently, dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway was reported in 89% of sporadic melanomas due to activating mutations in the BRAF or NRAS gene. BRAF mutations are found in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi, whereas none are present in Spitz nevi. NRAS mutations occur in 5?37% of melanomas and 9?56% of common melanocytic nevi. The mutational status of NRAS in Spitz nevi is unknown. This is the first study analyzing the mutational profile of BRAF and NRAS in Spitzoid melanomas occurring in prepubertal children (10 years of age or younger). Primary tumor cells were isolated via laser capture microdissection from 10 typical Spitz nevi and 10 metastatic Spitzoid melanomas. Exons 11 and 15 of BRAF and exons 2 and 3 of NRAS were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Common activating mutations were not identified in BRAF or NRAS. Absence of the V599E hot-spot mutation in BRAF was further confirmed by allele-specific PCR. We conclude that Spitzoid melanomas in children share clinical, histological and genetic similarities to Spitz nevi, and are genetically distinct from other melanoma subtypes.

AB  - The recognized breadth of dysplastic nevi has quickly shrunk. We now present very small dysplastic nevi below any described breadth. A cluster of mostly punched-out nevi derived from a single clinician who recognizes as ?atypical? even very small lesions was also assigned histologic dysplasia on architectural and cytologic basis. From 536 junctional nevi with dysplasia ranging from mild to moderate, 136 (25.3%) were 1?mm. in vitro or less while 371 (69.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Among 155 compound nevi with the same range of dysplasia, 19 (12.2%) were 1?mm or less and 95 (61.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Moderate or, less so, severe atypia was even seen in more than half of either 18 junctional and 18 compound nevi of dysplastic type between 2.1 and 3?mm. While the above threshold for dysplasia may not be similar to the one than many dermatopathologists could use, it is still evident that sliding down our higher-grade nevi to meet milder degrees of perceived atypia in a more conservative diagnostic scale, the breadth of these nevi still remains minuscule in general. In sum, we adhere to the idea that dysplastic nevi are not only common but can be extremely small: ?bonsai nevi.?

AB  - Pilomatricoma is a distinctive tumor characterized by a dual population of proliferating germinative cells and shadow cells and is beleived to derive from the hair matrix. Rarely, benign and malignant adnexal tumors can show pilomaticoma-like or hair matrix differentiation. We present a 69-year-old man with a ruptured cystic nodule of the left cheek. Histology revealed a dermal tumor composed of nests of basaloid cells which manifested peripheral palisading and abortive hair papilla formation with a modified stroma and pilomatricoma-like areas. This lesion shares features of a trichogenic adnexal neoplasm with those of a tumor having hair matrical differentiation, and has been rarely reported under the designation ?follicular? basal cell carcinoma (BCC). This case illustrates an example of this unusual occurrence of hair matrix differentiation in a benign basaloid adnexal neoplasm as characterized by the presence of basaloid and shadow cells; the absence of individual cell necrosis and mitotic activity prompts us to doubt that it represents a form of nodular BCC, but rather it more likely reflects a hamartoma of the follicular anlage.

AB  - Histological differentiation between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms such as trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma can be difficult on small biopsies. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify immunohistochemical differences between these entities. Recent studies showed androgen receptor expression in a number of mature epithelial structures in the skin and in epithelial neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, androgen receptor expression was absent in mature hair follicles or the few trichogenic neoplasms studied to date. These findings suggested that androgen receptor expression might be a useful adjunct in the histological differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of androgen receptor expression in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign trichoblastic tumors (6 trichoepitheliomas and 4 trichoblastomas). In our study, expression of androgen receptor was detected in 78% of basal cell carcinomas. None of the trichoblastic tumors showed any androgen receptor immunoreactivity. These results confirm the lack of androgen receptor expression in benign trichoblastic neoplasms and indicate that finding of androgen receptor expression points to basal cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis.

AB  - A 47-year-old sculptor presented with an ulcer on her neck. She is non-diabetic and had been on potassium iodide for hyperthyroidism. She developed a pruritic rash (?drug eruption), and her neck had been scratched repeatedly with papier-mache (PM)-covered fingers while she worked on PM sculptures for 3 consecutive months. Debrided material from neck ulcer revealed innumerable pieces of refractile PM in various shapes in the background of necrotic tissue and fibrinoid exudate, on polaroscopic examination of H&E sections. Stains for micro-organisms (for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and actinomycosis) were negative. In an attempt to remove residual embedded PM, wide excision of the site and full-thickness skin graft was done. After initial successful take and healing, the area redeveloped an ulcer. Additional debridement and biopsy from the graft site showed PM clustered around the blood vessels in the reticular dermis. PM is a product of paper pulp commonly used in arts and crafts. Rare cases of lead exposure in PM workers have been reported in the literature, however, no cutaneous problems caused by PM have been reported to date.

AB  - Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF), also called Reye tumor or inclusion body fibromatosis, is a benign proliferation of myofibroblasts, with characteristic perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The inclusions stain pink with hematoxylin-eosin, red with Masson?s trichrome, and purple with phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin. This intradermal neoplasm is formed by interlacing bundles of collagen and spindle cells. Positive immunohistochemical staining with vimentin, cytokeratin, desmin, and actin indicate myofibroblastic cell origin. Clinically, patients present at birth or infancy with asymptomatic smooth, flesh colored nodules, typically on lateral or dorsal digits. IDF is a benign neoplasm that may spontaneously regress and treatment is observation. Lesions recur in 60% of excisions; surgery is only recommended in cases of functional impairment or aggressive growth. We report three cases of IDF. The patients, ranging 8 months to 8 years old, presented with pink to flesh colored nodules on the feet and fingers. A spectrum of histological features was observed. All cases revealed dermal proliferation of spindle cells with blunt nuclei and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. Pattern of spindle cells ranged from loose haphazard arrangement to well-organized interlacing bundles. The quantity of eosinophilic inclusions varied. For diagnostic and treatment purposes, all three patients underwent excision, with subsequent recurrence in two cases.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - A 7-month-old male infant presented with a 2?month history of a solitary, well circumscribed, 1.2?cm right parietal scalp lesion. An MRI excluded intracranial extension of the lesion. Grossly the excised lesion was tan-grey, soft to rubbery with focal areas of hemorrhage. On histology, the lesion demonstrated elongated strands of haphazardly arranged fibrous tissue and meningothelial elements with clusters of plump, cuboidal epitheloid cells extending along connective tissue planes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The meningothelial elements were intimately admixed with mature adipose tissue and proliferation of small to medium sized vessels. The overlying epidermis was unremarkable. No mitotic figures or areas of necrosis were identified. The meningothelial cells were positive for Vimentin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen. S-100 protein was negative and CD-34 was positive only in the endothelial cells. The gross, histologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with ectopic meningothelial hamartoma of the scalp. The meningothelial elements characteristic of this entity are believed to arise from displaced, ectopic meningothelial rests in the scalp and are thus regarded as simply representing a proliferation of the hamartomatous process.

AB  - We present the findings of a rare and very aggressive primary skin tumor, composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumor (CERT) with features of rhabdomyosarcoma. Clinical history: A 53-year-old woman presented with a 2.5?cm ulcerated nodule on her right medial calf. On exam, she also exhibited inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathology: Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node and punch biopsy of the skin nodule disclosed an epithelioid cell morphology with rhabdoid cells, solid growth, and a high mitotic rate (>70 figures/10 HPF). Upon wide excision of the tumor, electron microscopy (EM) and special stains were performed. Since the differential diagnosis was broad, a large number of stains were performed: tumor was positive for vimentin, desmin, muscle specific actin, WT-1, CD56, and CD10, and negative for S-100, melan A, cytokeratins, EMA, CD34, fast myosin, myoglobin, myogenin, myoD1, smooth muscle actin, and NSE. EM revealed rhabdoid cells with perinuclear globules of intermediate filaments corresponding to the positive desmin stain. Summary: The patient was treated with chemotherapy without regression of presumed lung metastases. The CERT is a rare, aggressive tumor that extraordinarily presents as a primary skin tumor. The differential is broad and nomenclature confusing. Extensive ancillary pathology studies are required for appropriate diagnosis.

AB  - Title:?Will skin pathologists ever be replaced by noninvasive diagnostic tools (computers)? Intro: There are now many new non-invasive tools being developed to diagnose skin cancer, specifically melanocytic neoplasms. Whether these tools will ever be able to diagnose as well as a pathologist remains to be seen. In this paper, we will review most of the newly developed tools and discuss their specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Method: We reviewed the literature on currently available noninvasive diagnostic tools to find the published sensitivity and specificity rates of these tools. Tools without published information on their diagnostic accuracy were not included. We tabulated the accuracy data on the remaining tools and evaluated their relative diagnostic accuracy. Results: Melafind was found to have a specificity of 68?85% and a sensitivity of 95%?100%. Siascope was found to have a specificity of 82.7% and a sensitivity of 80.1%. Solarscan was found to have a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 100%. Comments: Non-invasive tools may be helpful in managing melanocytic neoplasms in patients with numerous lesions or with lesions in a cosmetically important site i.e. face. At present these tools cannot replace the value of a biopsy, microscopically reviewed by a pathologist.

AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma of the vulva (MMV) accounts for 2% of all melanomas in women with 5-year survival rate of 47%. Lymph node involvement predicts survival in these patients. Ki-67 expression has been correlated with lymph node status in cutaneous melanomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Ki-67 correlates with lymph node metastasis in MMV. Methods: Histomorphology and clinical information of 25?MMV were reviewed. The database was divided in MMV with metastasis (M+) and without lymph node metastasis (M-). A MMV subset was stained for Ki-67 and scored as a percentage (7 patients M+ and 9 patients M-). Results: The age range was 36?88 years-old (mean 63 years-old). The tumor thickness mean was 3.14?mm. The mean Ki-67 expression was 23% for M- and 42.5% for M+(p?=?0.07). Correlation of tumor thickness and Ki-67 expression also has a p value of 0.07. Logistic regression analysis was obtained.Conclusions: This study shows that Ki-67 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in MMV. However, when Ki-67 expression is compared to a classic prognostic indicator such as tumor thickness, it appears to have little or no additional predictive value. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

AB  - It is a little known fact that the organisms causing Zygomycosis are often better visualized with routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining than Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Experienced dermatopathologists, when evaluating histologic samples suspected of harboring deep fungal infection often rely more heavily on PAS staining to detect fungi. The diagnosis of Zygomycosis may be delayed or missed entirely if sufficient attention is not devoted to the H and E stained specimen. A review of multiple dermatopathology textbooks shows there is no universal agreement on the usefulness of routine H and E staining versus use of special stains for the detection of Zygomycosis. Grocott?s Methanamine Silver (GMS) staining can give false negative results if background staining of reticulum fibers is enhanced. This can occur because of overexposure in silver solution, excessive heat during processing, or use of incorrectly titrated solutions. Three consecutive culture proven cases of cutaneous Zygomycosis infection were evaluated. In each case, organisms were clearly visualized on routine H and E sections while PAS staining was variable. Examples of false negative GMS staining are also shown. Recognition of these staining properties can help dermatopathologists better detect the agents of Zygomycosis.
