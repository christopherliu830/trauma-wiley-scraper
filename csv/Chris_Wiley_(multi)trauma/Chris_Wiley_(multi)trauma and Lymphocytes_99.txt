AB  - We present the case of a 27 year-old female with a linear array of brown keratotic papules with a raised nodule within, located in the right mid upper inner thigh. A biopsy of the nodule showed a superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision of the entire lesion showed an epidermal nevus without residual carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas developing within an epidermal nevus constitute an unusual association, mostly occurring in long standing lesions of elderly patients. Other epithelial neoplasms described arising within epidermal nevi include basal cell carcinomas, malignant eccrine tumors and keratoacanthomas. Although our patient did not have an identifiable epidermal nevus syndrome, the presence of a squamous cell carcinoma within an epidermal nevus in a young person suggests increased susceptibility to tumor development. Moreover, chromosomal aberrations have been described in epidermal nevi, including chromosomal breakage and variegated translocation mosaicism. We suggest that the presence of an epidermal nevus should alert the clinician for the potential development of a malignant neoplasm within it, including squamous cell carcinoma, even in the absence of an identifiable hamartoma-neoplasm syndrome.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Abstract Bone is a highly organized structure comprising a calcified connective tissue matrix formed by mature osteoblasts, which develop from the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. The osteogenic cell lineage is thought to arise from a population of uncommitted multipotential stromal precursor cells (SPC) which reside close to all bone surfaces, in the bone marrow spaces and the surrounding connective tissue. These SPC also give rise to related cell lineages which form cartilage, smooth muscle, fat, and fibrous tissue. Due to the lack of well defined cell surface markers, little is known of the precise developmentally regulated changes in phenotype which occur during the differentiation and maturation of human osteoprogenitor cells into functional osteoblasts and ultimately, terminally differentiated osteocytes. In order to identify antibody reagents with greater specificity for osteoprogenitors we generated a series of antibodies following immunization with freshly isolated human bone marrow stromal fibroblasts. One such antibody, HOP-26, reacts with a cell surface antigen expressed by SPC and developing bone cells. We now demonstrate that this mAb identifies a member of the tetraspan family of cell surface glycoproteins, namely CD63. Western blot analysis of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) has revealed that like a well defined CD63 mAb 12F12, HOP-26 interacts with a heavily glycosylated cell surface protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50?60 kD.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.
