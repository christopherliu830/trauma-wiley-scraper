AB  - calleja p., aitken l.m.  (b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Objectives To investigate whether implementing a geriatric resuscitation protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement is associated with lower mortality through the early recognition of occult hypoperfusion (OH). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level I trauma center. Participants All hemodynamically stable individuals with blunt trauma aged 65 and older admitted to the Level I trauma center from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011 (n = 1,998). Measurements Mortality over time (according to quarter) was analyzed using an adjusted logarithmic regression model stratified according to the presence of OH. OH was defined as lactate of 2.5 mM or greater. Results Overall mortality was 3.9% (n = 78). Admission venous lactate was collected in 73.5% of participants, of whom 20.5% had OH (n = 301). In participants with OH, a significant decrease in mortality was observed over time (adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.66, P = .002). A smaller yet significant decrease in mortality rates in participants with normal perfusion status was also observed (adjusted R2 = 0.55, P = .01). Conclusion Early identification and treatment of OH in elderly adults with trauma using venous lactate-guided therapy coupled with early trauma surgeon involvement was associated with significantly lower mortality. A protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement should be followed to improve the care of elderly adults with trauma.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Teodorescu, D.-S., Heir, T., Hauff, E., Wentzel-Larsen, T.  64% of the patients had both PTSD and major depression disorder (MDD) and 80% of those who had PTSD had three or more additional diagnoses. Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics have high prevalence of PTSD, DESNOS, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders. A more severe symptomatology was found in patients diagnosed with both PTSD and DESNOS, than in those diagnosed with only PTSD. Higher rates of unemployment, weak social network and weak social integration were also prevalent in these outpatients, and related to increased psychiatric comorbidity and severity of symptoms. Further research may clarify the existence of a cumulative relationship between pre-resettlement traumas and post-resettlement stressors in the mental health of refugees, which in turn may help to improve therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Background Computed tomography (CT) is an essential diagnostic tool for severe multi-trauma patients. International guidelines recommend an optimal time of 1?h from arrival. The aim of this study was to determine the time interval from arrival at the emergency department to CT for all trauma patients and the effects on in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Methods Retrospective study of all patients who triggered a trauma call and underwent CT scanning at the Gold Coast University Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Exclusion criteria were scans performed at peripheral hospitals or performed more than 5?h after arrival to emergency department. Results One thousand six hundred and nineteen eligible trauma patients were admitted over the study period and underwent CT scanning. Median time to CT was found to be 43?min. CTs done within 1?h compared to those done after 1?h from emergency department arrival were found to have a higher mean injury severity score (11 ±?10 versus 9 ±?9, P =?0.003), a longer mean hospital length of stay (9 ±?21 versus 7 ±?13?days, P =?0.012) and no difference in mortality rates (2.2% versus 2.1%, P =?1.000). Age, injury severity score and intubation status were identified as independent predictors for longer hospital length of stay and higher mortality while time to CT did not. Injury severity score was shown to be an independent predictor of time to CT. Conclusion Our time to CT scanning is well within the timeframe recommended by international guidelines. Early CT scanning may also improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Summary Injury is a leading cause of death and disability, carrying with it a large economic burden to society. Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - SUMMARY The use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma patients is an exciting application because hemorrhage and coagulopathy play prominent roles both in the syndrome of severe hemorrhagic shock and in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotal use of rFVIIa in non-hemophilic trauma patients extends back to 1999, and experience at individual institutions is now in the hundreds of cases. Efficacy in controlling traumatic coagulopathy approaches 80%, with long-term survival of about half of the patients treated. There have been few reports of inappropriate thrombotic events in trauma patients. A single prospective randomized study of rFVIIa in victims of hemorrhagic shock has been completed, with some favorable results. Further trials in hemorrhagic shock are underway in both European and American trauma centers, while a trial in TBI patients will begin within the coming year.

AB  - Summary The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are effective statistical tools for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for binary-class medical data. However, many real-world biomedical problems involve more than two categories. The Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) and Hypervolume Under the ROC Manifold (HUM) measures are extensions for the AUC under three-class and multiple-class models. Inference methods for such measures have been proposed recently. We develop a method of constructing a linear combination of markers for which the VUS or HUM of the combined markers is maximized. Asymptotic validity of the estimator is justified by extending the results for maximum rank correlation estimation that are well known in econometrics. A bootstrap resampling method is then applied to estimate the sampling variability. Simulations and examples are provided to demonstrate our methods.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.
