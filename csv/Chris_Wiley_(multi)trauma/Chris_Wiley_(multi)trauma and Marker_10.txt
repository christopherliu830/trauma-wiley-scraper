AB  - Abstract The potential effects of maternal trauma on mother?infant interaction remain insufficiently studied empirically. This study examined the effects of the September 11, 2001, trauma on mother?infant interaction in mothers who were pregnant and widowed on 9/11, and their infants aged 4?6 months. Split-screen videotaped interaction was coded on a one-second basis for infant gaze, facial affect, and vocal affect; and mother gaze, facial affect, and touch. We examined the temporal dynamics of communication: self-contingency and interactive contingency of behavior by time-series methods. We documented heightened maternal and infant efforts at engagement in the 9/11 (vs. control) dyads. Both partners had difficulty tolerating moments of looking away as well as moments of negative behavior patterns. Heightened efforts to maintain a positive visual engagement may be adaptive and a potential source of resilience, but these patterns may also carry risk: working too hard to make it work. A vigilant, hyper-contingent, high-arousal engagement was the central mode of the interpersonal transmission of the trauma to these infants, with implications for intervention.

AB  - Abstract: This article considers the development of violence with particular reference to family factors in violence such as the quality of the parent-child relationship. In taking a developmental approach to violence, a link is established between the maltreatment of children in an attachment context and the risk of violence via the child's capacity to envision mental states in the other. Evidence from epidemiology and neuroscience is brought to bear on this link. Finally, some studies of prevention of violence that are likely to enhance attachment and mentalizing are considered.

Explosions in the understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes have recently been elucidated. In particular, the central role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the unfolding protein response (UPR) in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has recently been discovered. We hypothesize that ER stress and UPR are not only central for type 2 diabetes but also for stress-induced diabetes. We review here the evidence that post-burn insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common with type 2 diabetes. These recent discoveries not only highlight the importance of ER stress in the post-burn patient recovery, but furthermore enable new models to study fundamental and interventional aspects of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Objective To investigate the clinical significance of the detection of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTM) in older women with osteoporosis, and to compare their predictive power for osteoporotic fractures (OF). Methods In this retrospective study, 96 patients with OF and 107 patients with osteoporosis who were hospitalized in the Department of Orthopedics at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College were examined from October 2017 to February 2019. All selected patients were divided into either the fracture group (96 cases, 47.3%) or the non-fracture group (107 cases, 52.7%). BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BTM were detected by electrochemical luminescence: aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), ?-cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (?-CTX), and molecular fragment of osteocalcin N terminal (N-MID). Bone metabolism-related indicators were detected, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P). Independent-samples t-tests were used to compare the measurement data between the two groups, one-way ANOVA to compare the gaps between groups, and binary logistic regression to analyze the correlation of BMD and BTM with OF. Results There were no significant differences in age, weight, height, body mass index, age, and time of menopause between the two groups. There were a total of 71 cases (35.0%) in group A (60?70?years), 80 cases (39.4%) in group B (71?80?years), and 52 cases (25.6%) in group C (81?90?years). The fracture group was compared with the non-fracture group for BMD in the lumbar (0.75?±?0.05 vs 0.88?±?0.13, 0.75?±?0.16 vs 0.87?±?0.09, 0.74?±?0.21 vs 0.87?±?0.12 g/cm2; P?<?0.05), BMD in the hip (0.62?±?0.16 vs 0.74?±?0.14, 0.61?±?0.15 vs 0.73?±?0.0, 0.58?±?0.13 vs 0.73?±?0.08 g/cm2; P?<?0.05), PINP (83.7?±?5.7 vs 74.8?±?5.0, 80.7?±?4.1 vs 72.1?±?5.1, 81.2?±?7.0 vs 68.7?±?6.3 ng/mL, P?<?0.05), and ?-CTX (829.7?±?91.5 vs 798.8?±?52.2, 848.1?±?71.2 vs 812.4?±?79.0, 867.3?±?53.1 vs 849.1?±?67.2 pg./mL, P?<?0.05). N-MID (19.0?±?6.7 vs 21.3?±?9.7, 16.2?±?7.0 vs 18.0?±?5.3 ng/mL, P?<?0.05) in the fracture cases was lower than in the non-fracture cases for groups B and C, and there was statistical significance. Among the fracture cases, PINP in group A was higher than in group B and C, and ?-CTX in group C was higher than in group A and B (P?<?0.05). There was no significant difference in the ALP, P, and Ca between the two groups (P?>?0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that for BMD in the lumbar and hip, ?-CTX and OF were significantly correlated (respectively, odds ratio [OR] = ?4.182, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.672?3.448; OR = 6.929, 95% CI 2.586?12.106; OR = 7.572, 95% CI 1.441?3.059), and the differences were statistically significant. PINP and N-MID were correlated with OF (respectively, OR = 4.213, 95% CI 0.978?1.005; OR = 2.510, 95% CI 1.070?1.134, P?>?0.05), the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion Osteoporotic older women, with lower bone density and higher ?-CTX, are more likely to incur OF. ?-CTX is better than BMD at predicting OF and can help in its management and in implementing interventions in high-risk populations.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of a locally developed trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) program for maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined across different therapists in a child protection clinic setting. An earlier phase of the research piloting the program had provided promising results. This second phase involved two studies evaluating the completed TF-CBT manual delivered by (a) the developer and (b) other therapists. A single-case multiple-baseline design was used to demonstrate the controlling effects of the treatment on PTSD symptoms and child coping. Eight 9?13-year-old abused children with PTSD were treated. Positive outcomes support the effectiveness of the TF-CBT program delivered by both the developer and other therapists. The study design and methodology were robust enough to confirm empirically the clinically beneficial effects and potential for this new program. It was also apparent, however, from study limitations, including missing data for some patients, that there are a number of challenges in carrying out such research in a busy child protection service setting with multiply-abused patients. This paper considers implications and ways forward for engaging in empirically supported practice as well as future development and research.

AB  - Background: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is suggested to reflect the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and the main objective of the present study was to determine whether ScvO2 is associated with outcome in haemodynamically stabilized trauma patients. Methods: Haemodynamically unstable trauma patients receiving a central venous line within 1?h of admission were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate and ScvO2 were recorded at inclusion and every 6?h for 36?h or until lactate was <2.0?mmol/l and ScvO2 was >75% in two consecutive measurements. Patients with a MAP of ≥70?mmHg were considered to be haemodynamically stabilized. The outcome measure was complications defined as infections, delta sequential organ failure assessment score of >0, and mortality. Results: Fifty patients with a median new injury severity score of 27 (17?34) were analysed. Complications occurred in 33 patients. An association between ScvO2 following resuscitation to MAP ≥70?mmHg and complications was detected with an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% confidence interval; 0.89?0.99). This association was also significant when adjusted for injury severity. The result implies that a low ScvO2 value is associated with more complications. The optimal cut-off for ScvO2 to discriminate between patients who did or did not develop complications was found to be 66.5% (56?86%). Conclusions: These data suggest that low ScvO2 in haemodynamically stabilized patients is associated with a poor outcome and that ScvO2 represents a potential endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract The intersecting scenarios of multi-trauma, thoracic injury and traumatic cardiac arrest present some of the most demanding moments in paediatric trauma. For these reasons, decision support through teamwork, checklists, technology and guidelines are central to ensuring quality paediatric trauma care. The ?Rule of 4's? is a simple aide-memoire, which guides clinicians of all grades, expertise and distractedness in a reliable approach to injured children who require safe and effective emergency pleural decompression and timely insertion of a chest drain. The Rule of 4?s enables these important therapeutic goals to be met through: (i) four steps in a ?good plan?; (ii) fourth (or fifth) intercostal space as the basis for siting a ?good hole?; (iii) 4? uncuffed endotracheal tube size (4? [age/4?+?4]) to guide selection of a ?good tube?; and (iv) 4 cm mark for a ?good stop? to ensure the drain is in far enough but not too far.

AB  - In January of 1995 a massive earthquake struck the city of Kobe, Japan. This article examines how this event became an opportunity for extending global networks of the science and medicine of trauma. The article is based on ethnographic research in Kobe and Los Angeles with psychiatrists who responded to the earthquake in its immediate aftermath. Three aspects of the process are examined: 1) changes in psychiatric institutions that were ongoing at the time of the earthquake, 2) the place of psychiatry in Japanese cultural self-criticism, and 3) the particular technologies for identifying and treating trauma. Globalization in this case cannot be seen as an imposition of Western cultural forms, but rather an ongoing process that reproduces differences between cultures as particular elements travel between them.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - ABSTRACT Exposure to stressful environments in early childhood can cause a toxic stress response and lead to poor health outcomes, including obesity, cardiac disease, diabetes, and mental illness. In animals and maltreated children, the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific caregiver and parenting characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. In this study, framed in an ecobiodevelopmental (EBD) model, a cross-sectional design is being used to study 54 multi-ethnic, urban maternal-child dyads with children at early school age (4?9 years). Mothers? past experiences, mental health, and caregiving patterns and children's hair cortisol, C-reactive protein, pro-inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, BMI, behavior, and school performance are being analyzed to identify maternal characteristics that may protect against children's toxic stress response in families at high risk for exposure to stressors such as poverty, trauma, or exposure to violence.

AB  - Multi-leader teams are characterized by multiple leaders exhibiting mutual influence on each other while working towards a common team goal. An unexplored assumption in this literature is that increasing the number of leaders is related to heightened team effectiveness. The authors propose that this notion is oversimplified and suggest a contingency model of multi-leader team effectiveness. The authors suggest that the context determines the effectiveness of a particular multi-leader team configuration, because each formation has unique internal team mechanisms. To investigate this perspective, we review the multi-leader team literature (175 articles) by categorizing the extant theory and research as falling within nine multi-leader configurations along two key dimensions: (1) the proportion of leaders within a team; and (2) the dispersion of leadership through role co-enactment of team leaders. This framework enables a more coherent understanding as to the benefits and the costs of each specific multi-leader team configuration and a clearer evaluation of the contexts in which varying configurations are most effective. Four emerging themes related to configuration?contextualization are explained and theoretical implications for interpreting leadership effectiveness in multi-leader team settings are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Little is known about adult dental trauma experience at the population level. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associations of dental injuries in New Zealand (NZ) adults. Materials and Method Information about dental and orofacial trauma in a representative sample of NZ adults (aged 18-94) was collected in a national oral health survey. As well as self-reported information, the maxillary six anterior teeth were examined for signs of dental trauma. Survey weights were used. Results Of the 40.9% (95% CI: 37.6, 44.2) who reported previous orofacial trauma, 69.1% (95% CI: 64.3, 73.5), or just over one-quarter of the sample, reported that this included a dental injury. More males than females had experienced orofacial trauma (51.3% [95% CI: 45.8, 56.8] and 31.4% [95% CI: 27.9, 35.1], respectively). The most common injury was a ?chipped or broken tooth? (66.6%, 95% CI: 60.6, 72.1). Almost three-quarters had sought treatment. Clinical examination revealed an overall trauma prevalence of 23.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 26.0) with more males than females affected. Some 14.9% (95% CI: 12.8, 17.2) had one injured tooth, while 6.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 8.1) had two injured teeth. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently affected. Most participants with clinical signs of trauma had only one of the six maxillary teeth affected. The most common clinical dental trauma observation was evidence of ?treatment? or an ?untreated enamel fracture?, and these were more common among males and those aged 35-44 years. Conclusion Traumatic dental injuries constitute an important public health issue. More emphasis on preventing them in the NZ adult population is warranted, and public awareness of State-funded cover for dental injuries may need to be bolstered to enable equitable access for injury care. Overall, a greater emphasis on prevention and the importance of initial care for dental injuries could reduce the individual and societal burden.

AB  - Objective? To present the technique for intra-articular catheter placement and report the clinical outcomes of 38 cases of equine synovial trauma and/or infection treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials administered via an intrasynovial catheter (ISC). Design? Retrospective study. Procedure? Medical records of 38 horses treated for synovial trauma and sepsis with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained via clinical re-evaluation or telephone contact with the owners. Results? The majority of horses (84%) received amikacin and Timentin? four times daily. In addition, synovial lavage through the ISC was carried out in 27 horses (71%). Only radiological evidence of osteolysis had a significant negative impact on both lameness at the time of hospital discharge and the long-term outcome. In total, 92% of horses treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had clinical resolution of infection. Catheter obstruction occurred in three cases, necessitating replacement or removal, and two synovial fistulae developed at sites of open drainage. The majority of horses treated had a favourable outcome, with 86% being at least pasture sound and 43% returned to riding. Conclusion? Septic synovial structures treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had a good prognosis for survival and 43% returned to riding, which is consistent with the results of other studies. The use of a simple ISC should be considered when broad-spectrum intrasynovial antimicrobial administration and lavage of a septic synovial structure are indicated.

AB  - Comparisons of skeletal data on diet, disease, and trauma in elite and non-elite population samples from Mississippian sites throughout the Southeast have yielded a variety of patterns, some contradictory and some paralleling expectations based upon ethnohistoric accounts of elite sumptuary behaviors. Although trace element analyses of human bone from Alabama and Tennessee sites suggest that elites ate relatively more meat than their presumed social inferiors, non-elite health does not seem particularly compromised. The high prevalence of trauma in elite males at Chucalissa may reflect the role of warfare in male status advancement. The lords of the Southeast and their families may have been in effect ?overnourished? relative to everyone else, but probably not to the extent of historically documented African and Polynesian chiefly lineages whose literally weighty embodiment of superior social status impressed visiting travellers and ethnographers alike.

AB  - How are perceptions of past collective trauma related to moral lessons derived, and how are those in turn associated with conflict-related policy preferences of those presently involved in intractable conflict? We hypothesized that inclusive conceptions of past trauma will be positively associated with moral obligations and negatively with moral entitlement, and that moral obligations will be positively associated with humanitarian policies and negatively with militaristic policies, while moral entitlement will be positively associated with militaristic policies and negatively with humanitarian policies. In a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of Jewish Israelis (N = 504), moral obligations mediated the association between higher inclusivity of past collective trauma and humanitarian policy support, while moral entitlement mediated between lower inclusivity and increased militant policy support. Inclusive perceptions of past trauma and its moral lessons may play a critical role in advancing conflict resolution in intractable conflicts settings unrelated to the initial trauma.
