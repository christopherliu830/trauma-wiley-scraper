AB  - Abstract A primary interest of the field of infant mental health is in the early conditions that place infants at risk for less than optimal development. The fundamental problem of what constitutes normal and abnormal development is now a focus of developmental psychology, infant psychiatry, and developmental neuroscience. In the second part of this sequential work, I present interdisciplinary data to more deeply forge the theoretical links between severe attachment failures, impairments of the early development of the right brain's stress coping systems, and maladaptive infant mental health. In the following, I offer thoughts on the negative impact of traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental health, the neurobiology of infant trauma, the neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the etiology of dissociation and body?mind psychopathology, the effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some implications for models of early intervention. These findings suggest direct connections between traumatic attachment, inefficient right brain regulatory functions, and both maladaptive infant and adult mental health.??2001 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Abstract Prolonged and persistent hypermetabolism and excessive inflammatory response after severe trauma is detrimental and associated with poor outcome. The predisposing pathology or signals mediating this complex response are essentially unknown. As the liver is the central organ mediating the systemic metabolic responses and considering that adult hepatic stem cells are on top of the hierarchy of cell differentiation and may pass epigenetic information to their progeny, we asked whether liver progenitor cells are activated, signal hypermetabolism upon post-traumatic cellular stress responses, and pass this to differentiated progeny. We generated Sox9CreERT2: ROSA26 EYFP mice to lineage-trace the periportal ductal progenitor cells (PDPCs) and verify the fate of these cells post-burn. We observed increased proliferation of PDPCs and their progeny peaking around two weeks post-burn, concomitant with the hepatomegaly and the cellular stress responses. We then sorted out PDPCs, PDPC-derived hepatocytes and mature hepatocytes, compared their transcriptome and showed that PDPCs and their progeny present a significant up-regulation in signalling pathways associated with inflammation and metabolic activation, contributing to persistent hypermetabolic and hyper-inflammatory state. Furthermore, concomitant down-regulation of LXR signalling in PDPCs and their progeny implicates the therapeutic potential of early and short-term administration of LXR agonists in ameliorating such persistent hypermetabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite countless advancements in trauma care a survivability gap still exists in the prehospital setting. Military studies clearly identify hemorrhage as the leading cause of potentially survivable prehospital death. Shifting resuscitation from the hospital to the point of injury has shown great promise in decreasing mortality among the severely injured. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our regional trauma network (Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council) developed and implemented a multiphased approach toward facilitating remote damage control resuscitation. This approach required placing low-titer O+ whole blood (LTO+ WB) at helicopter emergency medical service bases, transitioning hospital-based trauma resuscitation from component therapy to the use of whole blood, modifying select ground-based units to carry and administer whole blood at the scene of an accident, and altering the practices of our blood bank to support our new initiative. In addition, we had to provide information and training to an entire large urban emergency medical system regarding changes in policy. RESULTS Through a thorough, structured program we were able to successfully implement point-of-injury resuscitation with LTO+ WB. Preliminary evaluation of our first 25 patients has shown a marked decrease in mortality compared to our historic rate using component therapy or crystalloid solutions. Additionally, we have had zero transfusion reactions or seroconversions. CONCLUSION Transfusion at the scene within minutes of injury has the potential to save lives. As our utilization expands to our outlying network we expect to see a continued decrease in mortality among significantly injured trauma patients.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

AB  - Abstract Initial research demonstrated that only low frequencies could be mimicked with rate of electrical stimulation, and thus multi-channel rather than single-channel stimulation was required for the place coding of the mid-high speech frequencies. Place coding of mid-high frequencies was best achieved with electrodes inside the cochlea. Furthermore, correct biomechanical properties of a multiple electrode bundle were required for it to pass around the cochlear spiral to the speech frequency region. Biological studies showed too that intra-cochlear electrodes could be used with minimal trauma, safe electrical stimulus parameters, and methods to prevent inner ear infection and meningitis. The crucial discoveries for coding speech with electrical stimulation have been based on the discovery of: 1) the fact the brain processes frequency information along spatial and temporal channels, and 2) that the first patient experienced vowels when stimulating different electrodes that corresponded to the place of excitation for single formant vowels in people with normal hearing. The inaugural and subsequent speech processing strategies extracted frequencies of special importance for speech intelligibility, and transmitted the information along place coding channels. The voicing frequency and/or amplitude, was coded as temporal information across these spatial channels. As a result a great majority of severely-to-profoundly deaf people with previous hearing can not only communicate when electrical stimulation is combined with lipreading, but with electrical stimulation alone. In addition, the benefits of binaural hearing with bilateral cochlear implants or an implant in one ear and hearing aid in the other ear have been realized. Related psychophysical research has discovered the basic perceptual skills that process the complex patterns of brain excitation that underlie speech recognition both in the one ear as well as bilateral implants. In addition the development of the perceptual skills in the maturing child for speech recognition, have been discovered. In the future high fidelity sound should be achieved by providing the fine temporo-spatial patterns of excitation and preserving the peripheral nerve network. This could require the release of nerve growth factors and the development of electrodes using nanotechnology. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin¬†3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P¬†<¬†0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62¬†ng¬†mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]¬†1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR]¬†1.51; 95%¬†[CI]¬†1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR¬†1.23; 95%¬†[CI]¬†1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR¬†1.33; 95%¬†[CI]¬†1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to explore the meanings and implications of dangerous memories in two different sites of past traumatic memories: one in Israel and the other in Cyprus. Dangerous memories are defined as those memories that are disruptive to the status quo, that is, the hegemonic culture of strengthening and perpetuating existing group-based identities. Our effort is to outline some insights from this endeavor?insights that may help educators recognize the potential of dangerous memories to ease pain and offer hope. First, a discussion on memory, history and identity sets the ground for discussing the meaning and significance of dangerous memories in the history curriculum. Next, we narrate two stories from our longitudinal ethnographic studies on trauma and memory in Israel and Cyprus; these stories are interpreted through the lens of dangerous memories and their workings in relation to the hegemonic powers that aim to sustain collective memories. The two different stories suggest that collective memories of historical trauma are not simply ?transmitted? in any simple way down the generations?although there are powerful workings that support this transmission. Rather, there seems to be much ambivalence in the workings of memories that under some circumstances may create openings for new identities. The final section discusses the possibilities of developing a pedagogy of dangerous memories by highlighting educational implications that focus on the notion of creating new solidarities without forgetting past traumas. This last section employs dangerous memories as a critical category for pedagogy in the context of our general concern about the implications of memory, history and identity in educational contexts.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - In recent years, local activists in the Global North and South have been organizing to improve degraded and abandoned spaces in marginalized neighborhoods by creating parks, playgrounds, urban farms, or community gardens. This paper integrates existing knowledge on urban place attachment and sense of community with scholarship on environmental justice in order to understand the role of place attachment in environmental mobilization in distressed neighborhoods across political systems and urbanization contexts. It examines the different forms of connections that activists develop and express toward neighborhoods with long-time substandard environmental conditions and how their experience of the neighborhood shapes their engagement in environmental revitalization projects. This comparison of three neighborhoods in Barcelona, Boston, and Havana shows that activists in all three places intend for their environmental endeavors to express grief at the loss of community, fears of erasure, and emotional connection and feelings of responsibility to place. To address environmental trauma, they aim to construct nurturing, soothing, ?safe havens,? recreate rootedness, and remake place for residents.

AB  - Abstract The restoration of a traumatized tooth may require minimally invasive or more extensive treatment options. The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Introduction The 227-bp SINE insertion in the promoter region of the MSTN gene, the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MSTN, g.66493737C>T, and the SNPs BIEC2-417274 and BIEC2-417495 located upstream and downstream of MSTN seem appropriate QTL markers for racing performance of elite Thoroughbreds. This pilot study aimed to find if these markers of racing ability can be used to optimize the management of the racing careers of Turkish Thoroughbreds. Methods Hair roots were used for DNA extraction. The promoter insertion was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product. The SNPs were typed by the amplification refractory mutation system-real-time PCR. Best racing distance was defined as the distance of the races in which the horse obtained the best results. Results were semi quantified by a point score based on wining and places. Results BIEC2-417274, BIEC2-417495 SNP variants and the 227-bp SINE were strongly associated with g.66493737C>T. For the latter, the genotype frequencies were: C/C 0.23, C/T 0.52 and T/T 0.25. In total 39% of the Turkish races are distances >1600?m. Analysis of the racing career showed that both the sprinters (C/C) and the medium distance horse (C/T) were not entered optimally in races that fit with their genetic ability. Conclusions Turkish race programing should create more opportunities for the g.66493737 C/T genotypes to show their ability. This implies that more 1700 to 2800?m races should be scheduled in the racing calendar. Ethical Animal Research Owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Jockey Club of Turkey.

AB  - Abstract Very little is known about the cardiometabolic risk of migrants who settle in Australia. This study investigated differences in cardiometabolic risk markers among ethnic groups attending a tailored healthy lifestyle program in Queensland, Australia; and differences in these markers between those living in Australia for shorter versus longer periods of time. Baseline data collected between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Living Well Multicultural?Lifestyle Modification Program were used. People living in ethnic communities in Queensland who were ‚â•18¬†years old, and not underweight were eligible to participate. Independent variables were ethnicity and length of time in Australia. Outcomes were cardiometabolic risk markers including BMI, waist circumference, weight-to-height ratio (WHtR) and hypertension. Analyses were done separately for each independent variable. Linear and logistic regressions were run for continuous and binary outcomes with differences/Odds ratios reported respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that Burmese/Vietnamese had an average BMI lower than Afghani/Arabic (3.7 points), Somalian/Sudanese (4.7 points) and Pacific Islander (11.6 points) (p¬†<¬†0.001) respectively. Differences in waist circumference between Burmese/Vietnamese with Sri Lankan/Bhutanese, Afghani/Arabic, Somalian/Sudanese and Pacific Islander were 6.3, 8.4, 9.1 and 24.0¬†cm (p¬†<¬†0.01) respectively. Although Burmese/Vietnamese also had lower average WHtR compared to the others, the differences were not significant for Somalian/Sudanese. Moreover, Sri Lankan/Bhutanese and Pacific Islander were more likely to be hypertensive compared to Burmese/Vietnamese (p¬†<¬†0.05). Immigrants living in Australia >5years had on average 1.2 points higher BMI, 2.4cm larger waist circumference, and 0.02 points higher WHtR (p¬†<¬†0.05) compared to those living for ‚â§5¬†years. Long-stay immigrants were also more likely to be hypertensive than short-stay immigrants (p¬†<¬†0.01). In conclusion, cardiometabolic risk is significantly different among ethnic groups in Queensland with Pacific Islanders having the highest risk. Immigrants living in Australia >5¬†years had higher risks compared to those living in Australia for shorter periods of time.
