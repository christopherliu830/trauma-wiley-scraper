AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival and causes of death of 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were examined. The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1% vs. the expected rate 48.5%, that for MID 11.9% vs. 45.2% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68% of AD patients, and in 38% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.

AB  - Abstract Background In the era of frequent head-to-pelvis computed tomography (CT) for adult blunt trauma evaluation, we sought to update teachings regarding aortic injury by determining 1) the incidence of aortic injury; 2) the proportion of patients with isolated aortic injury (without other concomitant thoracic injury); 3) the clinical implications of aortic injury (hospital mortality, length of stay [LOS], and rate of surgical interventions); and 4) the screening value of traditional risk factors/markers (such as high-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray [CXR]) for aortic injury, compared to newer criteria from the recently developed NEXUS Chest CT decision instrument (DI). Methods We conducted a preplanned analysis of patients prospectively enrolled in the NEXUS Chest studies at 10 Level I trauma centers with the following inclusion criteria: age > 14 years, blunt trauma within 6 hours of ED presentation, and receiving chest imaging during ED trauma evaluation. Results Of 24,010 enrolled subjects, 42 (0.17%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13% to 0.24%) had aortic injury. Most patients (79%, 95% CI = 64% to 88%) had an associated thoracic injury, with rib fractures, pneumothorax/hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion occurring most frequently. Compared to patients without aortic injury this cohort had similar mortality (9.5%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 22.1% vs. 5.8%, 95% CI = 5.4% to 6.3%), longer median hospital LOS (11 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), and higher median Injury Severity Score (29 vs. 5, p < 0.001). High-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on CXR had low sensitivity for aortic injury (76% [95% CI = 62% to 87%] and 33% [95% CI = 21% to 49%], respectively), compared to the NEXUS Chest CT DI (sensitivity 100% [95% CI = 92% to 100%]). Conclusions Aortic injury is rare in adult ED blunt trauma patients who survive to receive imaging. Most ED aortic injury patients have associated thoracic injuries and survive to hospital discharge. Widened mediastinum on CXR and high-energy mechanism have relatively low screening sensitivity for aortic injury, but the NEXUS Chest DI detected all cases.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Background Data examining the effect of operator years in practice and volume on adverse events (AE) after cardiac catheterization in patients with congenital heart disease is limited. Methods and Results Data were prospectively collected using a multi-center registry (C3PO). 10,885 catheterizations performed between 02/07 and 06/10 at eight institutions were included. AE rates were risk-adjusted for hemodynamic vulnerability, procedure type risk group, and age and compared between operators with different years in practice (YIP) and volume. AE occurred in 13% of procedures. Operators with less than five YIP had higher adjusted odds of any AE (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14?1.77) or a high severity AE (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04?1.75), when compared with operators with 5 to less than 25 YIP (5?<?25), while operators with ≥25 YIP had higher odds of a high severity (but not any) AE (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08?1.80). Operators with <5 YIP had a higher percentage of preventable AE (out of all AE, 16% vs. 8%, P?<?0.001) as well as higher odds of vascular or cardiac trauma (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11?2.97), or technical AE (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.31?2.99) when compared with operators with 5?<?25 YIP. There was no consistent relationship between operator volume, and incidence of AE. Conclusions Operators with less than 5 years in practice have higher risk-adjusted AE rates. While an important consideration in guiding and mentoring operators with fewer years in practice, it is important to emphasize that reporting adverse events does not take into account procedural efficacy. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcome and adverse events following ventral stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs with clinical AA subluxation using screw/polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) constructs in a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Study Design Historical cohort study. Animals 35 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 3 institutions were reviewed to identify dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw and PMMA constructs. Data on signalment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, imaging performed, and adverse events were retrieved. Neurologic examination data were abstracted to generate a modified Frankel score at admission, discharge, and re-examination. Telephone interview of owners >180 days postoperative was conducted. Results Thirty-five dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw/PMMA constructs were included. Most dogs were young (median age 1 year), small breed dogs with acute onset of neurologic signs (median duration 22.5 hours). Most dogs were non-ambulatory at the time of admission (median modified Frankel score 3). Adverse events were identified in 15/35 dogs including 9 dogs with major adverse events. Four dogs required a second surgery due to vertebral canal violation (n?=?2) or implant failure (n?=?2). Re-examination at 4?6 weeks postoperative reported 15/28 dogs with improved neurologic status and 19/28 dogs were ambulatory. Telephone follow-up was available for 23/35 dogs with 23/23 reported as ambulatory (median follow-up 390 days). Conclusions Ventral application of screw and PMMA constructs for AA subluxation, as described here, is associated with clinical improvement in the majority of dog. Major adverse events are infrequent and the technique is considered relatively safe.

AB  - Summary Epilepsy can be a devastating disorder. In addition to debilitating seizures, epilepsy can cause cognitive and emotional problems with reduced quality of life. Therefore, the major aim is to prevent the disorder in the first place: identify, detect, and reverse the processes responsible for its onset, and monitor and treat its progression. Epilepsy often occurs following a latent period of months to years (epileptogenesis) as a consequence of a brain insult, such as head trauma, stroke, or status epilepticus. Although this latent period clearly represents a therapeutic window, we are not able to stratify patients at risk for long-term epilepsy, which is prerequisite for preventative clinical trials. Moreover, because of the length of the latent period, an early biomarker for treatment response would be of high value. Finally, mechanistic biomarkers of epileptogenesis may provide more profound insight in the process of disease development.

The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

Effects of a yoga breath intervention alone and in combination with an exposure therapy for PTSD and depression in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami. Objective:? This study evaluated the effect of a yoga breath program alone and followed by a trauma reduction exposure technique on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami. Method:? In this non-randomized study, 183 tsunami survivors who scored 50 or above on the Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17) were assigned by camps to one of three groups: yoga breath intervention, yoga breath intervention followed by 3?8?h of trauma reduction exposure technique or 6-week wait list. Measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-17) and depression (BDI-21) were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24?weeks. Data were analyzed using anova and mixed effects regression. Results:? The effect of treatment vs. control was significant at 6?weeks (F2,178?=?279.616, P?<?0.001): mean PCL-17 declined by 42.5?±?10.0 SD with yoga breath, 39.2?±?17.2 with Yoga breath?+?exposure and 4.6?±?13.2 in the control. Conclusion:? Yoga breath-based interventions may help relieve psychological distress following mass disasters.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - ABSTRACT Communities with major recreational attractions tend to be rural and to have high injury experience both because of environmental hazards unique to rural areas and because they attract urban visitors who may be unfamiliar with the area andits roads, engaging in activities for which they are poorly prepared, and using equipment that is rented, in poor condition, or even of inherently hazardous design or construction. Alcohol abuse by visitors is often aproblem. Once injured, visitors may have difficulty gaining access to emergency care andwhen received, such care may be limited in both quantity and quality. While the influx of visitors to rural areas brings jobs and income, it also may bring crowding, violence, unintentional injury and other stresses. Most rural recreational communities do not actively plan as a community to deal with these problems, but rather approach them piecemeal and with limited communication among all necessary participants. Such planning is essential if progress is to be made.

AB  - Summary Multi-lumen extensions used to infuse multiple fluids via a single intravenous cannula might increase resistance and so limit the flow that can be achieved. We constructed low-pressure and high-pressure models and compared the effect of two different multi-lumen extensions on flow rate. Both multi-lumen extensions reduced flows by up to 76% (p < 0.001). The effect was greatest with large cannulae and in the high-pressure model, with the longer and narrower extension most impeding flow. Multi-lumen extensions can therefore significantly impede fluid flow, and should be avoided or removed when rapid infusion is required. These effects are less important in paediatric anaesthesia where smaller cannulae are used. Manufacturers should include internal diameter or flow effects on the packaging of these extensions to assist clinicians in making such decisions.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a tentative understanding of the characteristics of the extreme traumas, elsewhere called ?complex PTSD?, that some refugees and asylum-seekers bring into therapy. It suggests that these kinds of traumas suffered during adulthood may involve a disintegration of the self and a loss of ?psychic skin?. This conceptualization is derived from the treatment of a refugee who survived multiple extreme traumas and with whom efforts were made in therapy to identify a complex methodology making use of supplementary therapeutic tools in addition to individual psychotherapy. The case demonstrates how the disintegration of self implies not only a deep somato-psychic dissociation, but also a loss of intrapsychic and interpersonal space. In the treatment this was worked through via repetition of the victim-aggressor dynamics at multiple levels. In the end, the therapeutic context was structured like a set of concentric layers, creating a ?bandage? over the patient's wounds whilst his ?psychic skin? was able to regenerate. The conditions triggered by extreme traumas in refugees challenge some of the cornerstones of individual psychoanalytic technique, as well as the idea that individual therapy may be thought of as existing in an environmental vacuum.
