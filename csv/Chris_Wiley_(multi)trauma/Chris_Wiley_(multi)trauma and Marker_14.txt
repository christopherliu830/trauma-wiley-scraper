AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of our study was to determine the association between biomechanical outcomes of walking gait (peak vertical ground reaction force [vGRF], vGRF loading rate [vGRF-LR], and knee adduction moment [KAM]) 6 months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and biochemical markers of serum type-II collagen turnover (collagen type-II cleavage product to collagen type-II C-propeptide [C2C:CPII]), plasma degenerative enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-3 [MMP-3]), and a pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6 [IL-6]). Biochemical markers were evaluated within the first 2 weeks (6.5?±?3.8 days) following ACL injury and again 6 months following ACLR in eighteen participants. All peak biomechanical outcomes were extracted from the first 50% of the stance phase of walking gait during a 6-month follow-up exam. Limb symmetry indices (LSI) were used to normalize the biomechanical outcomes in the ACLR limb to that of the contralateral limb (ACLR/contralateral). Bivariate correlations were used to assess associations between biomechanical and biochemical outcomes. Greater plasma MMP-3 concentrations after ACL injury and at the 6-month follow-up exam were associated with lesser KAM LSI. Lesser KAM was associated with greater plasma IL-6 at the 6-month follow-up exam. Similarly, lesser vGRF-LR LSI was associated with greater plasma MMP-3 concentrations at the 6-month follow-up exam. Lesser peak vGRF LSI was associated with higher C2C:CPII after ACL injury, yet this association was not significant after accounting for walking speed. Therefore, lesser biomechanical loading in the ACLR limb, compared to the contralateral limb, 6 months following ACLR may be related to deleterious joint tissue metabolism that could influence future cartilage breakdown. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Developing ways to manage terrorism effectively requires a better understanding of how the public perceives this threat. In the present study, Canadians' perceptions of terrorism risk and 4 other hazards were assessed using a word-association technique and rating scales reflecting key cognitive dimensions of risk (threat, uncertainty, control) and worry reactions. Data were collected in a national telephone survey. Canadians perceived terrorism as posing a lower threat, as more uncertain, and as less controllable, compared to the other hazards. Positive associations of perceived threat and of perceived uncertainty with worry about terrorism were observed. However, perceived control was unexpectedly positively associated with worry about terrorism. The findings also suggest that additional social contextual factors should be examined in future research.

AB  - Abstract Psychotherapy with the elderly has tended to be restricted to family or behavioural paradigms with some contribution from cognitive approaches, but at least until recently, very little input from psychodynamic therapy. The reasons for this are discussed and include both patient and therapist factors. Freud himself was pessimistic regarding the prospects of working with the elderly, a viewpoint he changed as he aged. As the discipline of old age psychiatry also matures there may be increasing scope for collaboration between the mental health of the elderly teams and psychodynamically orientated therapists. We describe here one model of such collaboration, a weekly case discussion seminar, conducted in an acute admission old age psychiatry in-patient unit. The role of the seminar in discussing difficult cases will be described and a case will be discussed to illustrate the work. Finally, recommendations for broadening the scope of the work are advanced. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The discovery, analysis, and validation of any biomarker, including nucleic acid-based biomarkers remains a challenging task. This chapter focuses on the three most prominent urologic malignancies: bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For every tumor entity, it provides an overview of the hereditary tumor syndromes and the underlying genetic aberrations followed by biomarkers in the setting of sporadic tumor disease. Three prognostic groups were defined within a cohort of 150 cystectomy patients: patients with abnormal findings in both assays had the worst prognosis, those with normal findings in both assays had the best prognosis, and those with one abnormal and one normal finding had an intermediate probability of recurrence and survival. There are several pathways that are important for prostate cancer tumorigenesis and progression, especially the PTEN, c-Myc, and Erg pathways, and therefore a combination of biomarkers in all three pathways may have the greatest impact.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the Intensive In-home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service (IICAPS), a large-scale home-based intervention that collaboratively engages the family, school, and various other service providers (e.g. health practitioners or judicial systems) to prevent the hospitalization, institutionalization or out-of-home placement of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Multi-informant data (youth, parents and clinician) on the level of youth problem severity and functioning was gathered from 7169 youth and their families served by the IICAPS network, pre- and post-intervention. A newly developed ?Multi-informant Latent Consensus? (MILC) approach was employed to measure mental health ?baseline levels? and change, within a Structural Equation Modeling framework. The MILC approach demonstrated promise integrating information from multiple informants involved in the therapeutic process to yield a more accurate and systemic view of a child's level of functioning and problem severity than each report taken individually. Results indicated that the IICAPS family and community based intervention model led to a reduction of problem severity and improved functioning in children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance.

AB  - Background The literature is sparse on written test development in a post-graduate multi-disciplinary setting. Developing and evaluating knowledge tests for use in multi-disciplinary post-graduate training is challenging. The objective of this study was to describe the process of developing and evaluating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test for use in a multi-disciplinary training program in obstetric-anesthesia emergencies. Methods A multi-disciplinary working committee with 12 members representing six professional healthcare groups and another 28 participants were involved. Recurrent revisions of the MCQ items were undertaken followed by a statistical analysis. The MCQ items were developed stepwise, including decisions on aims and content, followed by testing for face and content validity, construct validity, item?total correlation, and reliability. Results To obtain acceptable content validity, 40 out of originally 50 items were included in the final MCQ test. The MCQ test was able to distinguish between levels of competence, and good construct validity was indicated by a significant difference in the mean score between consultants and first-year trainees, as well as between first-year trainees and medical and midwifery students. Evaluation of the item?total correlation analysis in the 40 items set revealed that 11 items needed re-evaluation, four of which addressed content issues in local clinical guidelines. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 for reliability was found, which is acceptable. Conclusion Content and construct validity and reliability were acceptable. The presented template for the development of this MCQ test could be useful to others when developing knowledge tests and may enhance the overall quality of test development.

An image segmentation and organ reconstruction software package has been developed and employed to transform the 2D VHF images into a 3D polygonal representation. Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces were then mapped to the polygonal surfaces, and were finally utilized to create a robust 3D hexahedral finite element mesh within a commercially available meshing software. The model employs a combined viscoelastic and hyperelastic material model to successfully simulate the behaviour of biological soft tissues. The finite element model was then validated for use in biomechanical research. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a need for an ideal indicator of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Several markers have been analysed, but the search still continues as none have proven effective. This study aimed to analyse and compare the predictive value of plasma procalcitonin (PCT) strip test in patients presenting with acute abdomen and identify a useful cut-off value to differentiate patients that would benefit with surgery from those that require conservative management. Methods A prospective study was conducted in the department of general surgery from June 2012 to June 2013. Plasma PCT was estimated by the semi-quantitative strip test. The levels of plasma PCT and other routinely used markers of inflammation were analysed and compared. Results Of the total of 58 patients, 44 patients (76%) were men with a mean age of 45 years. Forty patients required emergency surgical intervention. A plasma PCT value of >0.5?ng/mL at admission was 80% sensitive and 100% specific for predicting need for antibiotics in patients with acute abdomen that were managed conservatively. The mean plasma PCT value in the patients undergoing surgery (5.0?10.0?ng/mL) was significantly more than in those managed conservatively (0.5?2.0?ng/mL). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves a cut-off for plasma PCT of >5.0?ng/mL was 75% sensitive and 100% specific for considering surgical intervention in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Conclusions Plasma PCT (value?>5?ng/mL) could be used as an adjunct to clinical examination to predict requirement of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen.

The patients in the delayed condition improved somewhat during the waiting list period, but at the end of treatment the two conditions were not significantly different. However, treatment gains were a little higher in the immediate group, with up to a 32% reduction in symptoms. There were no significant differences between therapists. The rate of improvement while under therapy was much higher than while awaiting assessment. Improvements were greatest for those with high Psychoticism and Obsessive Compulsive scores.

AB  - Abstract Background The Virtopsy project, a multi-disciplinary project that involves forensic science, diagnostic imaging, computer science, automation technology, telematics and biomechanics, aims to develop new techniques to improve the outcome of forensic investigations. This paper presents a new approach in the field of minimally invasive virtual autopsy for a versatile robotic system that is able to perform three-dimensional (3D) surface scans as well as post mortem image-guided soft tissue biopsies. Methods The system consists of an industrial six-axis robot with additional extensions (i.e. a linear axis to increase working space, a tool-changing system and a dedicated safety system), a multi-slice CT scanner with equipment for angiography, a digital photogrammetry and 3D optical surface-scanning system, a 3D tracking system, and a biopsy end effector for automatic needle placement. A wax phantom was developed for biopsy accuracy tests. Results Surface scanning times were significantly reduced (scanning times cut in half, calibration three times faster). The biopsy module worked with an accuracy of 3.2 mm. Discussion Using the Virtobot, the surface-scanning procedure could be standardized and accelerated. The biopsy module is accurate enough for use in biopsies in a forensic setting. Conclusion The Virtobot can be utilized for several independent tasks in the field of forensic medicine, and is sufficiently versatile to be adapted to different tasks in the future.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and hypervigilance. Increasing research on the ?gut?brain? axis (bidirectional signaling between the gut and the brain) has drawn links between PTSD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an exceedingly common yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal condition. This meta-analysis thus aimed to examine the body of evidence and extent of association of PTSD with IBS. Methods Using the keywords [early abuse OR childhood abuse OR violence OR trauma OR PTSD] AND [irritable bowel syndrome or IBS], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 11,257 papers published in English between January 1, 1988, and May 1, 2018. Of these, only eight studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Results The eight studies (four cross-sectional and four cohort) contained a total of 648,375 subjects. Most studies were from the USA and conducted on army veterans. The funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies, and Egger test was not significant for publication bias (P = 0.583). Random-effects meta-analysis found PTSD to be a significant risk factor for IBS (pooled odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 3.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, PTSD is associated with an increased likelihood of IBS. This is the first meta-analysis to specifically examine the association between PTSD and IBS, and it provides insights into the probable (patho)physiology and management of IBS, supporting a holistic consideration of the psychosocial aspects of IBS and further research into effective multi-modal therapeutics.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2013; 19: 242?248 Abstract The impact of bloodstream infection (BSI) on admission to hospital on the outcome of patients with community-acquired sepsis (CAS) admitted to intensive-care units (ICU) is largely unknown. We selected 803 adult patients consecutively admitted with CAS to one of 17 Portuguese ICU, in whom blood cultures were collected before initiation of antibiotic therapy during a 12-month period. A BSI was identified on hospital admission in 160 (19.9%) patients. Those with and without BSI had similar mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and age. The presence of BSI was independently associated with mortality in ICU (adjusted odds ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.20?2.89; p 0.005). On the 4th day in ICU, patients with BSI were found to be significantly more dependent on vasopressor support (p 0.002) but not on ventilatory support. Cumulative ICU mortality was significantly higher in BSI patients from the 9th day onwards. A seasonal variation of BSI isolates was noted: gram-negative BSI were more common in the summer, whereas in the winter, gram-positive infections were more frequent (p 0.024), without mortality differences.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The survey was supported by a grant from the Petplan Charitable Trust. Boehringer Ingelheim assisted with survey distribution. Competing interests:?None.
