AB  - Abstract Mammalian body condition is an important individual fitness metric as it affects both survival and reproductive success. The ability to accurately measure condition has key implications for predicting individual and population health, and therefore monitoring the population-level effects of changing environments. No consensus currently exists on the best measure to quantitatively estimate body condition in many species, including cetaceans. Here, two measures of body condition were investigated in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). First, the most informative morphometric body condition index was identified. The mass/length2 ratio was the most appropriate morphometric index of 10 indices tested, explaining 50% of the variation in condition in stranded, male porpoises with different causes of death and across age classes (n = 291). Mass/length2 was then used to evaluate a second measure, blubber cortisol concentration, as a metabolic condition marker. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone involved in the regulation of lipolysis and overall energy balance in mammals, and concentrations could provide information on physiological state. Blubber cortisol concentrations did not significantly vary around the girth (n = 20), but there was significant vertical stratification through the blubber depth with highest concentrations in the innermost layer. Concentrations in the dorsal, outermost layer were representative of concentrations through the full blubber depth, showed variation by sex and age class, and were negatively correlated with mass/length2. Using this species as a model for live cetaceans from which standard morphometric measurements cannot be taken, but from which blubber biopsy samples are routinely collected, cortisol concentrations in the dorsal, outermost blubber layer could potentially be used as a biomarker of condition in free-ranging animals.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.

AB  - Despite advances in evidence-based treatments (EBTs), research suggests these interventions are not utilized in practice settings. This study examined implementation of multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP), an EBT for childhood mood disorders, in two outpatient community clinics. Fifteen community therapists facilitated MF-PEP. Twenty community clinicians referred 40 children ages 8?12 with mood disorders and their parents who participated in MF-PEP. Preliminary descriptive findings based on observations and self-report questionnaires demonstrated implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of MF-PEP at these clinics. Parents also demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of mood disorders posttreatment. Preliminary results support implementation of MF-PEP in practice settings and suggest community-based MF-PEP may be associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background Work-related crushing injuries are serious but preventable. For 2013 through 2015, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics? (BLS) Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) reported 1260 crushing injuries in Michigan. In 2013, Michigan initiated multi-data source surveillance of work-related crushing injuries. Methods Records from all 134 of Michigan's hospitals/emergency departments (EDs), the Workers Compensation Agency (WCA) and Michigan's Fatality Assessment Control and Evaluation (MIFACE) program were used to identify work-related crushing injuries. Companies, where individuals were hospitalized or had an ED visit for a crushing injury, potentially had an OSHA enforcement inspection conducted. Results From 2013 through 2015, there were 3137 work-related crushing injury incidents, including two fatalities. The Michigan OSHA program completed inspections at 77 worksites identified by the surveillance system. Conclusion The Michigan multisource surveillance system identified two and a half times more crushing injuries than BLS and was useful for initiating case-based enforcement inspections.

AB  - Being able to finely characterize the spinal cord (SC) microstructure and its alterations is a key point when investigating neural damage mechanisms encountered in different central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or myelopathy. Based on novel methods, including inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and dedicated SC probabilistic atlas post-processing, the present study focuses on the in vivo characterization of the healthy SC tissue in terms of regional microstructure differences between (i) upper and lower cervical vertebral levels and (ii) sensory and motor tracts, as well as differences attributed to normal aging. Forty-eight healthy volunteers aged from 20 to 70?years old were included in the study and scanned at 3?T using axial high-resolution T2*-w imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and ihMT, at two vertebral levels (C2 and C5). A processing pipeline with minimal user intervention, SC segmentation and spatial normalization into a reference space was implemented in order to assess quantitative morphological and structural parameters (cross-sectional areas, scalar DTI and MT/ihMT metrics) in specific white and gray matter regions of interest. The multi-parametric MRI metrics collected allowed upper and lower cervical levels to be distinguished, with higher ihMT ratio (ihMTR), higher axial diffusivity (??) and lower radial diffusivity (??) at C2 compared with C5. Significant differences were also observed between white matter fascicles, with higher ihMTR and lower ?? in motor tracts compared with posterior sensory tracts. Finally, aging was found to be associated with significant metric alterations (decreased ihMTR and ??). The methodology proposed here, which can be easily transferred to the clinic, provides new insights for SC characterization. It bears great potential to study focal and diffuse SC damage in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Keloid scars are described as benign fibro-proliferative dermal outgrowths that commonly occur in pigmented skin post cutaneous injury, and continue to grow beyond the boundary of the original wound margin. There is a lack of thorough understanding of keloid pathogenesis and thus keloid therapeutic options remain ill-defined. In view of the poor response to current therapy and high recurrence rates, there is an unmet need in improving our knowledge and therefore in identifying targeted and effective treatment strategies in management of keloids. Keloid research however, is hampered by a lack of relevant animal models as keloids do not spontaneously occur in animals and are unique to human skin. Therefore, developing novel animal models and nonanimal models for functional evaluation of keloid cells and tissue for better understanding their pathobiology and response to putative candidate therapies are essential. Here, we present the key concepts and relevant emerging research on two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell and tissue models for functional testing of keloid scars. We will describe in detail current models including in vitro mono- and co-cultures, multi-cellular spheroids (organoids) and organotyopic cultures, ex vivo whole skin keloid tissue organ culture models as well as in vivo human patient models. Finally, we discuss the role played by time as the fourth dimension in a novel model that involves sequential temporal biopsies of human patients with keloids (a so called 4D in vivo human model). The use of these unique models will no doubt prove pivotal in identification of new drug targets as well as biomarkers, in functional testing of emerging novel therapeutics, and in enhancing our understanding of keloid disease biology.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents findings from a subsample of 24 young females aged 8?16 years who were referred to specialist services in England during the 1990s because of their abusive sexual behaviours. The characteristics, backgrounds and behaviours of the sample are summarized and compared both with the males in the total population studied and with findings from the limited international literature on young female sexual abusers. Key findings include the higher rates of sexual victimization amongst females, their lack of prior criminal convictions, their somewhat younger ages at referral and their fewer victims. A smaller selection of case studies is used to illustrate the range of circumstances and behaviours leading to referral. Follow-up interviews with two female ex service users, who are now in young adulthood, indicate that their childhood sexually abusive behaviour is more a marker of vulnerability than of risk of abusive behaviour in adulthood. Their struggles now as parents, in adult relationships and their ongoing health difficulties are outlined.

AB  - Abstract To be able to diagnose systemic candidiasis (SC) and to predict outcomes in SC patients are still challenging tasks for physicians. Previous proteomic studies suggest that anti-Candida methionine synthase (Met6p) IgG antibodies may be a candidate marker for SC. To evaluate their reliability for diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification in SC, we developed a generic prototype strategy for their measurement in SC. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses revealed a high diagnostic accuracy for this prototype format, which was slightly better to that for the widely used Western blot assays. Multivariate logistic-regression models showed a positive association between serum anti-Met6p IgG antibody levels and SC risk that was independent from established SC risk factors and other baseline variables. After adjusting for and stratifying according to known prognostic factors, a significant trend toward a lower two-month mortality risk with increasing levels was evidenced in SC patients at presentation. We conclude that these antibodies may be useful in discriminating SC from non-SC patients and determining risk stratification in SC. These may also confer protection against SC and be valuable for the design of future immunotherapies. Furthermore, our prototype format has the potential to make impact on other infectious diseases, cancers, allergies or autoimmune disorders.

AB  - Abstract Anxiety is understudied in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is not justified by the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorders on quality of life in PD patients. In this cross-sectional study, 342 patients suffering from idiopathic PD underwent a research-based assessment including DSM IV criteria for anxiety disorders, the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS) and the beck anxiety inventory (BAI). Thirty-four percent (34%) of subjects met the DSM IV criteria for at least one anxiety disorder; 11.8% met criteria for multiple anxiety disorders; and 11.4% had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms without meeting the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder. Score profiles on the HARS and BAI differed significantly between the disorders, but these differences were associated with different scores on a limited number of items, and the respective symptom profiles were not readily interpretable. Female sex, the presence of motor fluctuations, as well as a previous history of an anxiety disorder were markers for anxiety disorders. The use of a mono-amino oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor was associated with a reduced prevalence of anxiety disorders. Research into anxiety in PD is hampered by the questionable validity of DSM IV defined anxiety disorders in this population. A first focus for research should therefore be the identification of clinically useful anxiety presentations and their validation in PD. ? 2011 Movement Disorder Society

Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Conventional heart rate variability (HRV) indices comprise time domain and frequency domain HRV indices that not only reflect the autonomic control of the heart but also serve as prognostic markers of various cardiovascular disorders. These indices have been extensively investigated as prognostic factors for patients who develop coronary artery diseases including myocardial infarction (MI). Non-linear indices of HRV such as the long (?)- and short (α1 and ?2)-term fractal component indices and approximate entropy analysis have been clinically applied. In addition, heart rate turbulence (HRT) and the deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate have been studied as potential HRV indices for predicting untoward outcomes of cardiovascular diseases. This overview examines HRV indices and their roles in the setting of cardiovascular disorders including sudden cardiac death. We describe changes in HRV indices and clarify the relationship between prognosis and the indices in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper explores the effect of plant profitability on the closure decision in multi-locational manufacturing firms where the firm is selecting between different sites undertaking similar production activities. The paper draws upon a new interview survey of large multi-locational manufacturing firms. Analysis of the interview data shows that plant profitability is the key to understanding only one-third to one-half of selective closures and that decisions taken by subsidiaries are more likely to rely on plant profitability measures than decisions taken at the corporate head office. In analyzing a regional economy, a poor level of plant profitability is indicative of a plant at risk of closure but the absence of such a characteristic is not necessarily an indication of an assured future for a plant.

Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

Urinary cortisol levels were assessed in 54 children aged 8?18 upon admission to a level-1 trauma center. Six weeks posttrauma, 15-hour urine samples were collected from children and their mothers. Depression and PTSS were assessed at 6 weeks (N = 44) and 7 months (N = 38) posttrauma. Higher child in-hospital cortisol significantly predicted 6-week child PTSS. This was true only for boys at 7 months. In mothers, lower 6-week cortisol levels significantly predicted 7-month PTSS. Results extend findings of differing directions of acute hormonal predictors of PTSS in adults versus children to a sample of genetically related individuals.

AB  - Objectives This comprehensive review examined the prevalence and progression of disturbances in reality testing (DRT), defined as psychotic symptoms, cognitive disruptions, and thought problems, in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (O-BD). Our approach was grounded in a developmental psychopathology perspective and considered a broader phenotype of risk within the bipolar?schizophrenia spectrum as measured by categorical and dimensional assessments of DRT in high-risk youth. Methods Relevant studies were identified from numerous sources (e.g., PubMed, reference sections, and colleagues). Inclusion criteria were: (i) family risk studies published between 1975 and 2012 in which O-BD were contrasted with a comparison group (e.g., offspring of parents who had other psychiatric disorders or were healthy) on DRT outcomes and (ii) results reported for categorical or dimensional assessments of DRT (e.g., schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms, cluster A personality traits, or thought problems), yielding a total of 23 studies. Results Three key findings emerged: (i) categorical approaches of DRT in O-BD produced low incidence base rates and almost no evidence of significant differences in DRT between O-BD and comparison groups, whereas (ii) many studies using dimensional assessments of DRT yielded significant group differences in DRT. Furthermore, (iii) preliminary evidence from dimensional measures suggested that the developmental progression of DRT in O-BD might represent a prodrome of severe psychological impairment. Conclusions Preliminary but promising evidence suggests that DRT is a probable marker of risk for future impairment in O-BD. Methodological strengths and weaknesses, the psychometric properties of primary DRT constructs, and future directions for developmental and longitudinal research with O-BD are discussed.

AB  - Sertoli cell tumor of the testis (not otherwise specified) in a 43-year-old man is reported. Macroscopically, the testicular mass measured 3.0???2.3???1.5?cm and was well circumscribed. The cut surface was white to tan-gray in color. Neoplastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm proliferated with solid and tubular structures. Neoplastic cells focally contained vacuoles of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Cystic formation and cord formation in the hyalinized stroma was also observed. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratin 8, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but neoplastic cells were negative for placental alkaline phosphatase, inhibin-α and pancytokeratin. The stroma in the tumor center and capsule contained a significant number of myofibroblasts that were positive for α-smooth muscle actin and negative for h-caldesmon, but no CD34-positive stromal cells were detected in the stroma of the tumor center. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic cells had cytoplasmic processes and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. However, dense core granules were absent. It is important to differentiate between Sertoli cell tumor and carcinoid tumor because of the positive reaction for neuroendocrine markers in both tumors. Myofibroblasts are a major stromal component of Sertoli cell tumor of the testis.

AB  - Recent scientific reports and popular press describing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) collectively link this condition to a broad array of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including extremely rare and multi-determined behaviors such as murder-suicide. These reports are difficult to reconcile with several decades of research on the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, especially the natural history and prognosis of mild TBI. This article attempts to reconcile these sources by reviewing the state of the science on CTE, with particular attention to case definitions and neuropathological criteria for this diagnosis. The evidence for links between TBI, CTE, and catastrophic clinical events is explored, and the complexity of attributing rare frequency behavioral events to CTE is highlighted. The clinical and medicolegal implications of the best available evidence are discussed, concluding with a cautionary note against prematurely generalizing current findings on CTE to entire populations of persons with, or at risk for, concussion exposures.
