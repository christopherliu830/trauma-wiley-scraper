AB  - Abstract The existence of interactions between sequential enzymes of metabolic pathways has been explored extensively throughout the field of biochemistry. These closely coupled pathways, termed metabolons, have been demonstrated to induce substrate channeling that results in increased efficiency by enhancing local substrate concentrations, protecting liable intermediates, and limiting distance between enzyme active sites. This phenomenon may have direct implication in the advancement of multi-enzyme enzymatic biofuel cells through the use of super-complex formations as bioanode catalysts. This will result in an efficient means of a more complete oxidation of a fuel, while optimizing the flux of the system through the recreation of a phenomenon that is conserved throughout biology.

AB  - Summary Interpretation of cervical radiographs can be challenging due to the complex anatomy and superimposition of osseous structures on either side of the vertebrae. This report describes the investigation of neck pain in a Thoroughbred gelding following a traumatic fall. Several imaging modalities were used to demonstrate the presence of a fracture of the left cranial articular process of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), including nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography, oblique radiographic projections and a novel cineradiographic technique. Oblique radiographs were superior to standard lateral-lateral radiographs in both the diagnosis and for monitoring the progression of healing of the articular process fracture in this case.

AB  - Summary Background? MMX? mesalazine [LIALDA? (US), MEZAVANT? XL (UK and Ireland) MEZAVANT? (elsewhere)] utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System? (MMX) technology which delivers mesalazine throughout the colon. Two phase III studies have already evaluated MMX mesalazine in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Aim  To provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of MMX mesalazine over placebo by combining the patient populations from the two phase III studies. Methods? Combined data from two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Patients randomized to MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day (once daily or 1.2?g twice daily), 4.8?g/day (once daily) or placebo were reviewed. The primary end point was clinical and endoscopic remission (modified Ulcerative Colitis-Disease Activity Index of ≤1 calculated as: rectal bleeding and stool frequency scores of 0, a combined Physician?s Global Assessment and sigmoidoscopy score of ≤1, no mucosal friability and a ≥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from week 0). Results? Data from 517 patients were analysed. 8-week remission rates were 37.2% and 35.1% in the MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day and 4.8?g/day groups, vs. 17.5% on placebo (P?<?0.001, both comparisons). 8-week complete mucosal healing rates were 32% in both MMX mesalazine groups compared with 16% on placebo. Adverse event frequency was similar in all groups. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine is effective and generally well tolerated for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - Abstract Abnormal oscillatory brain activity in dementia may indicate incipient neuronal/synaptic dysfunction, rather than frank structural atrophy. Leveraging a potential link between the degree of abnormal oscillatory activity and cognitive symptom severity, one could localize brain regions in a diseased but pre-atrophic state, which may be more amenable to interventions. In the current study, we evaluated the relationships among cognitive deficits, regional volumetric changes, and resting-state magnetoencephalography abnormalities in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N?= 10; age: 75.9?±?7.3) or primary progressive aphasia (PPA; N?= 12; 69.7?±?8.0), and compared them to normal aging [young (N?= 18; 24.6?±?3.5), older controls (N?= 24; 67.2?±?9.7]. Whole-brain source-level resting-state estimates of relative oscillatory power in the delta (1?4 Hz), theta (4?7 Hz), alpha (8?12?Hz), and beta (15?30?Hz) bands were combined with gray matter volumes and cognitive scores to examine between-group differences and brain?behavior correlations. Language and executive function (EF) abilities were impaired in patients with PPA, while episodic memory was impaired in MCI. Widespread oscillatory speeding and volumetric shrinkage was associated with normal aging, whereas the trajectory in PPA indicated widespread oscillatory slowing with additional volumetric reductions. Increases in delta and decreases in alpha power uniquely predicted group membership to PPA. Beyond volumetric reductions, more delta predicted poorer memory. In patients with MCI, no consistent group difference among oscillatory measures was found. The contributions of delta/alpha power on memory abilities were larger than volumetric differences. Spontaneous oscillatory abnormalities in association with cognitive symptom severity can serve as a marker of neuronal dysfunction in dementia, providing targets for promising treatments.

It describes common challenges that practitioners meet, when working with extreme trauma. It suggests three concepts that might help to understand the complicated dynamics of severe traumatization. These concepts deal as well with the nature of post-traumatic problems as with the way they might be treated. A clinical case is used to exemplify and discuss the concepts. Finally the article offers some thoughts on the special dynamics of the situation of refugees.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder for young people, and it is associated with educational underachievement, self-harm, and suicidality. Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused only on individual-level change and often neglect family or contextual influences. The efficacy of interventions may be enhanced with a broader therapeutic focus on family factors such as communication, conflict, support, and cohesion. This article describes a structured multi-family group approach to the treatment of adolescent depression: Behaviour Exchange Systems Therapy for adolescent depression (BEST MOOD). BEST MOOD is a manualized intervention that is designed to address both individual and family factors in the treatment of adolescent depression. BEST MOOD adopts a family systems approach that also incorporates psychoeducation and elements of attachment theories. The program consists of eight multifamily group therapy sessions delivered over 2 hours per week, where parents attend the first four sessions and young people and siblings join from week 5. The program design is specifically aimed to engage youth who are initially resistant to treatment and to optimize youth and family mental health outcomes. This article presents an overview of the theoretical model, session content, and evaluations to date, and provides a case study to illustrate the approach.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To generate a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields using images acquired from 7 T, multi-echo, gradient-echo MRI for the evaluation of epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders as well as investigating (apparent transverse relaxation rate) and quantitative volume magnetic susceptibility (QS) of the subfields. Experimental Design: Healthy control subjects (n?=?17) were scanned at 7 T using a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence and susceptibility-weighted magnitude images, and QS maps were reconstructed. We defined a hippocampal subfield labeling protocol for the magnitude image produced from the average of all echoes and assessed reproducibility through volume and shape metrics. A group-wise diffeomorphic registration procedure was used to generate an average atlas of the subfields for the whole subject cohort. The quantitative MRI maps and subfield labels were then warped to the average atlas space and used to measure mean values of and QS characterizing each subfield. Principal Observations: We were able to reliably label hippocampal subfields on the multi-echo susceptibility images. The group-averaged atlas accurately aligns these structures to produce a high-resolution depiction of the subfields, allowing assessment of both quantitative susceptibility and across subjects. Our analysis of variance demonstrates that there are more apparent differences between the subfields on these quantitative maps than the normalized magnitude images. Conclusion: We constructed a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields for use in voxel-based studies and demonstrated in vivo quantification of susceptibility and in the subfields. This work is the first in vivo quantification of susceptibility values within the hippocampal subfields at 7 T. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3588?3601, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess novel differences in serum levels of glucose, lactate and amino acids in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) compared to age-matched controls, at baseline and in response to universal hypoxia. Methods Twelve patients diagnosed with NTG and eleven control subjects underwent normobaric hypoxia for 2 hr. Peripheral venous blood samples were taken at baseline, during hypoxia and in the recovery phase. Serum glucose and lactate levels were measured by a blood gas analyser. Amino acids were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Baseline levels of lactate and total amino acids were significantly lower in patients with NTG compared to healthy controls. No differences were seen in blood glucose levels between the two groups. Lactate levels remained unchanged during hypoxia in the control group, but increased in patients with NTG. In the recovery phase, total amino acid levels were reduced in the control group, whereas no changes were found in patients with NTG. Conclusion Reduced serum levels of lactate and total amino acids were identified as potential markers for NTG. Moreover, significant differential regulatory patterns of certain amino acids were found in patients with NTG compared to control subjects. Overall, our results suggest a link between systemic energy metabolites and NTG and support a novel understanding of glaucoma as an inner retinal manifestation of a systemic condition.

AB  - Abstract Assays facilitating the measurement of mediators and markers of allergic inflammation have evolved during the past 40 years, arising from two primary discoveries: first, that immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the source of reaginic activity in serum, and second, that tissue mast cells and blood basophils cells expressing the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεR1)?respond to allergen by releasing the most relevant mediators underlying immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Naturally, skin testing has long been used to assess the in vivo mast cell response to allergen. Basophils, however, by virtue of their accessibility and the fact that they are the sole source of many of these mediators among blood leukocytes, continue to dominate the performance of in vitro assays assessing IgE-mediated responses.

Acute procedural success was defined, for purposes of this review, as a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg and no more than mild aortic regurgitation (AR) for patients with isolated cAS. For patients with mixed aortic valve disease, a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg without worsening of AR was considered successful outcome. Results In 373 patients with a median age of 8 months (1 day to 40 years of age) peak systolic gradient had a median of 59 [50, 71] mm Hg pre-BAVP and 22 [15, 30] mm Hg post-BAVP (P?<?0.001). Procedural success was achieved in 160 patients (71%). The factors independently associated with procedural success were: first time intervention (OR?=?2.0 (1.0, 4.0) P?=?0.04), not-prostaglandin dependent, (OR=3.5 (1.5, 8.1); P?=?0.003), and isolated cAS (absence of AR) (OR?=?2.1 (1.1?3.9); P?=?0.03). Twenty percent of patients experienced adverse events, half of which were of high severity. There was no procedural mortality. Neonatal status was the only factor associated with increased risk of high severity adverse events (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.5?9.0). Conclusion In the current era, BAVP results in procedural success (gradient reduction with minimal increase in AR) in 71% of patients treated at US centers where BAVP is considered first-line therapy relative to surgery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This study examined how the characteristics of people with mental illness who are participants in post-booking jail diversion programs affect recidivism and time spent incarcerated. The study employed data from a multi-site, federally funded jail diversion initiative. A pre?post comparison design was used to compare experiences of arrest and days spent in jail of diverted individuals for the 12 months following enrollment with the 12 months prior to enrollment. Also compared were differences in 12-month public safety outcomes. Data were collected between February 2003 and August 2007. The findings suggest that people with mental illness who are diverted from jail to community-based services experience fewer arrests and jail days. Approximately half of the sample were never arrested during the 12 months following enrollment. The strongest differences between people who experienced reduced contact with the criminal justice system and people with unchanged or increased contact were found in measures of criminal history. The results suggest that services targeted to diverted individuals with mental illness should address public safety goals, not just those of public health. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - doi: 10.1111/j.1741-2358.2010.00440.x Loss of natural dentition: multi-level effects among a geriatric population Objective:? To quantify the impact of edentulousness on residual ridge volume, denture stomatitis (DS), as well as oral health behaviours among geriatric denture-wearers. Background:? Residual ridge resorption (RRR) is the primary intraoral complication of complete edentulism, but individual variation among geriatric patients has been observed. Materials and methods:? Data collection relied upon a 10-year retrospective chart review of all complete denture-wearing geriatric patients presenting at the Removable Prosthodontics Clinic, Dental School of Athens, between 1993 and 2002. Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on ordinal logistic regression. Results:? A total of 873 records of geriatric patients (age mean?=?72; median?=?70; range?=?65?95) comprised our analytical sample. Subjects? mean (SD) time since edentulation was 7.7 (10.2) years. Eleven percent were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). While 28% of patients reported cleaning their dentures at least daily, 6% presented with denture stomatitis (DS). Each added year of edentulism increased the odds of mandibular RRR: OR (95% CI)?=?1.05 (1.03, 1.07). Nightly denture wear was the strongest risk factor for DS. Finally, independent of age and sex, each year of being edentulous increased the odds of presenting with TMD: OR (95% CI)?=?1.03 (1.01, 1.05). Conclusion:? Time since edentulation was strongly associated with mandibular but not maxillary RRR, as well as TMD development.

AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.
