AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

AB  - Abstract Out of 37 patients requiring emergency surgery for upper limb ischaemia, 9 were due to spontaneous embolus, 7 to arterial laceration and 21 followed cardiac catheterization. Eleven of the initial operations (30 per cent) failed to relieve ischaemic symptoms though 6 were corrected by further operations. Success at the initial operation was associated with (i) repair with end-to-end anastomosis after resection, saphenous vein bypass or interposition graft, or generous vein patch, (ii) exposure of the radial/ulnar bifurcation, (iii) instillation of heparinized saline locally or (iv) restoration of the radial pulse at the end of the operation. In the cases studied in whom all the above recommendations were followed, the operation was entirely successful and all patients have a radial pulse and are currently symptom free.

AB  - Background Tetrastarch can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) in humans with sepsis, but less likely to result in tissue edema than lactated Ringer's solution (LRS). Objectives Compare effects of volume replacement (VR) with LRS and 6% tetrastarch solution (TS) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) and markers of AKI in hemorrhaged dogs. Animals Six healthy English Pointer dogs (19.7?35.3 kg). Methods Prospective crossover study. Animals underwent anesthesia without hemorrhage (Control). Two weeks later, dogs hemorrhaged under anesthesia on 2 occasions (8-week washout intervals) and randomly received VR with LRS or TS at 3 : 1 or 1 : 1 of shed blood, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained until 4 hour after VR for EVLW measurements derived from transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine concentrations in plasma and urine were measured until 72 hour after VR. Results The EVLW index (mL/kg) was lower at 1 hour after TS (10.0 ± 1.9) in comparison with controls (11.9 ± 3.4, P = 0.04), and at 4 hour after TS (9.7 ± 1.9) in comparison with LRS (11.8 ± 2.7, P = 0.03). Arterial oxygen partial pressure-to-inspired oxygen fraction ratio did not differ among treatments from 0.5 to 4 hour after VR. Urine NGAL/creatinine ratio did not differ among treatments and remained below threshold for AKI (120,000 pg/mg). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Although TS causes less EVLW accumulation than LRS, neither fluid produced evidence of lung edema (impaired oxygenation). Both fluids appear not to cause AKI when used for VR after hemorrhage in healthy nonseptic dogs.

AB  - Summary The shoulder has greatest range of motion of any joint in the body, and is a frequent site of injury. Shoulder girdle includes proximal humerus, scapula, and lateral clavicle. The anatomic structures involved in fracture of the proximal humerus include humeral head, anatomic neck, surgical neck, and greater and lesser tuberosities. The fractures to the proximal humerus result from a direct blow, fall on an outstretched hand in the elderly, or are related to glenohumeral joint fracture-dislocation. Fractures of the humeral shaft may result from direct trauma, high-velocity motor vehicle accidents or a fall. Scapular fractures are infrequent as the scapula is surrounded and protected by large and prominent muscle attachments. Acromioclavicular joint injury is commonly due to a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Radiographs are generally the first step in initial imaging modality for patients with shoulder trauma.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators? use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of δ15N and δ13C variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal δ15N values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult δ15N values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

AB  - Summary The incidence of multiple pregnancies continues to rise, in part due to the increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques. Due to the serious maternal and perinatal complications with multiple pregnancies and the further increased risks with higher order multiples, selective fetal reduction has been offered in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. This invasive, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous procedure has theoretical risks of pregnancy loss, morbidity to the surviving fetuses and associated risks of premature ruptured membranes and preterm labour. It also evokes complex ethical and moral issues for the parents, clinicians and society as a whole. Pregnancy outcome rates have improved following selective fetal reduction as experience with techniques have improved and the number of very high order pregnancies has reduced.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - Abstract The relation between state formation and identity in MENA multi-sectarian societies is examined, taking Syria as a case study. The paper looks at the impact of the mix of sectarianism and nationalism on the formation of state institutions and the impact of the latter on this mix. The flawed export of the Westphalian state system to MENA established the structural context?multiple identities, hybrid states?wherein the two identities compete, overlap, and coexist. Next, the factors that explain varying identity patterns in MENA are surveyed and their likely consequences for state formation; then, reversing the analysis, the impact of state formation and state institutions on the nationalism?sectarianism balance is examined. The Syrian case is briefly discussed in order to illustrate the argument, looking at three periods when the identity balance interacted differently with state formation: pre-Ba'thist Syria when nationalism eclipsed sectarianism; Ba'thist Syria (1970-2000) when patrimonial instrumentalization of sectarianism was compensated for by inclusive bureaucratic institutions, populist policies, and nationalist ideology; neo-liberal Syria under Bashar al-Asad (2000-2010) when inclusion shrank, reanimating sectarianism; and civil war Syria (2010-) when partial state failure fostered exclusionary militant sectarianism at the expense of nationalism.

AB  - Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, break down a few days after being assaulted. After a first attempt at denial, the ego is submerged with repressed content. Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to bind the enormous quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge. Repetition, because of its compulsive quality, fails. The victim remains in a state of helplessness against which she resorts to denial, splitting and projection (Freud, 1920, 1926). This strategy is seen, however, as maintaining the victim in a state of helplessness. Thus, I suggest that, overwhelmed, the ego finally resorts to a multi-levelled system of defence. On a first level, fixation to the trauma, like in screen-memories, gives way to a first displacement. On a second level, the adoption of an identity built upon being a victim contributes to the strength of this displacement. On a third level, identification with the aggressor consolidates this defensive strategy by giving meaning to the hostility awakened by the sexual assault.

AB  - Well over 80 years ago Philip Smith described the beneficial clinical effects of adrenocortical extracts in animal models of adrenal insufficiency. In the ensuing years, scientists across the globe have sought to understand the mechanisms by which adrenal hormones and their synthetic analogues produce their complex and varied actions. Particular attention has focused on the glucocorticoids, partly because they have a vital place in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders but also because dysregulation of the secretion and/or activity of endogenous glucocorticoids is increasingly implicated in a number of common disorders that pose a growing clinical burden, such as obesity, type II diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and depression. This review considers some of the key advances that have been made in our understanding of the physiology, pathology and pharmacology of the glucocorticoids. Emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and the complex mechanisms that regulate the access of steroids in the systemic circulation to their receptors in their various target cells and tissues. In addition, consideration is given to the irreversible ?organisational? actions of glucocorticoids in perinatal life and to the potential role of the steroids in the aetiology of disease.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes to bed configuration and patient mix on nurses? workload in a single ward. Design Multi-method case study. Method The study was undertaken in an acute 28-bed ward in a tertiary referral public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Ward-level administrative data were obtained for a 2-year period, 12 months before bed configuration changes in October 2015 and 12 months after. These data included patient activity (bed occupancy, transfers, length of stay and casemix) and nurse staffing (budgeted and actual staffing levels, employment status and skillmix). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ward nurses (N = 17) to explore the impact of the bed configuration changes on their workload. Results Administrative data showed that the bed configuration changes resulted in more complex and dependent patients, increased patient transfers and greater variability in casemix. The interview data found these changes to patient complexity and activity intensified workloads, which were further increased by staffing decisions that resulted in greater reliance on temporary staff. Conclusion Hospitals already possess the data and expert knowledge needed to improve staffing and bed management decisions without the need for additional, costly workload systems. Impact Determining appropriate nurse staffing in light of the complexities and variation of patient needs at the ward level remains a challenge. This study identified increases in patient complexity, dependency, variability and churn that increased workload. Staffing grew but hidden factors associated with temporary staffing and skillmix further intensified nurses? workload. Harnessing existing data and the expertise and experience of nursing unit managers (NUMs) would help staff wards more efficiently and effectively, providing reasonable workloads and appropriate skillmix that can enhance the safety and quality of patient care. To facilitate this, NUMs need access to accurate, timely, data and authority in staffing and bed management decisions.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between farming and cancer risk was investigated in an integrated series of case-control studies conducted from 1985 to 1991 in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, north-east Italy. Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, thyroid gland, kidney and urinary tract, bladder, prostate, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myelomas, and controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, were interviewed. For males, a significantly elevated relative risk was seen for oral cavity and pharynx. Farming, however, was associated with a significant protection against cancer of the colon and rectum and bladder. In females, only one significant association emerged, for multiple myeloma. A few significant interactions between cancer risk and year of birth (i.e., before 1930 or 1930 and after) were observed. The risk of cancer of the larynx was significantly elevated in younger male farmers but not in older ones. Our multi-site case-control study confirms that farmers have, for some cancer sites, a distinctive pattern. Excesses of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in farmers are characteristic of the present study area and, possibly, of similar European rural populations who have in common high levels of alcohol consumption and, at least in the past, unbalanced diets.

AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective Yiqifumai injection is a compound Chinese medicine used to treat microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases clinically. Our previous study proved that Yiqifumai injection pretreatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced venular albumin leakage in rat mesentery. This study aimed to investigate whether Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability and corresponding contribution of its main ingredients. Methods Rats were challenged by lipopolysaccharide infusion (5 mg/kg/h) for 90 minutes. Yiqifumai injection (160 mg/kg/h), Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h), Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h), and Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h) + Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h) were infused 30 minutes before (pretreatment) or after (post-treatment) lipopolysaccharide administration. Results Both pretreatment and post-treatment with Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral venular albumin leakage during lipopolysaccharide infusion and cerebrovascular hyperpermeability at 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide infusion. Yiqifumai injection restrained the decreased junction protein expression, adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria complex I, II, IV, and V activities. Moreover, Yiqifumai injection inhibited toll-like receptor-4 expression, Src phosphorylation, and caveolin-1 expression. Its main ingredients Rb1 and Sch alone worked differently, with Rb1 being more effective for enhancing energy metabolism, while Sch attenuating toll-like receptor-4 expression and Src activation. Conclusion Yiqifumai injection exerts a protective and ameliorated effect on cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability, which is more effective than any of its ingredients, possibly due to the interaction of its main ingredients through a multi-pathway mode.
