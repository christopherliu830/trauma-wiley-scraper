AB  - Summary: We surveyed the treatment of 1 04 patients admitted to 27 out of the 46 departments of neurology (64.5%), neurosurgery (23.0%), and child neurology (12.5%) of Lombardy, the largest Italian Region (population, 9,000,000). Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy. RÉSUMÉ 1104 Patients admis dans 27 des 46 départements de neurologie (64,5%), de neurochirurgie (23,0%) et neurologie pédiatrique (12,5%), de Lombardie, la plus grande région d'ltalie (9.000.000 d'habitants), ont été inclus dans une enquête dont le but principal était d'apprécier la pénétration d'un diagnostic et d'une information clinico-pharmacologique corrects dans la pratique de routine. Une analyse detaillee et une discussion des donnees suivantes sont rapportees: les raisons de 1'hospitalisation (ajustement therapeutique, 27,3%, affirmation du diagnostic, 53,8%); les caracteristiques de la maladie, selon sa duree, ses manifestations cliniques et le type des crises; les troubles as-socies; la prevalence et les criteres d'utilisation des procedes instrumentaux de diagnostic (EEG, radio du crane, scanographie, etc ?); les modalites de prescription des medicaments antiepileptiques à l'entree et à la sortie, en mettant l'accent sur les choix par specialite; la fréquence de la monothérapie (41%à l'entrée, 47,0% a la sortie) par rapport à la polythérapie; le degré de correspondance entre les doses prescrites et les doses prises par le patient (les patients tendent plus souvent à diminuer les doses qu'à les augmenter); l'observation des effets collatéraux. Tout en confirmant certains résultats d'études récentes, ce travail illustre la possibilite de mise au point d'un programme régulier de contrôle des résultats de l'ensemble d'un systeme sanitaire dans le traitement de l'épilepsie.

AB  - Abstract The Chocolate BAR study is a prospective multicenter post-market registry designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Chocolate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter in a broad population with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The primary endpoint is acute procedural success (defined as ≤30% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection); secondary long-term outcomes include freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), major unplanned amputation, survival, and patency. A total of 262 patients (290 femoropopliteal lesions) were enrolled at 30 US centers between 2012 and 2014. The primary endpoint of procedure success was achieved in 85.1% of cases, and freedom from stenting occurred in 93.1%. Bail out stenting by independent adjudication occurred in 1.6% of cases and there were no flow limiting dissections. There was mean improvement of 2.1 Rutherford classes (±1.5) at 12-months, with 78.5% freedom from TLR, 97.2% freedom from major amputation, and 93.3% freedom from all-cause mortality. Core Lab adjudicated patency was 64.1% at 12 months. Use of the Chocolate balloon in an ?all-comers? population achieved excellent procedural outcomes with low dissection rates and bailout stent use.

AB  - Abstract Aim This is a study protocol to investigate nurses' perspectives on refugee health care in two countries. The aims are to: (a) explore self-reported work environment factors, including work stressors, self-rated leadership, staffing and resources adequacy, and teamwork among Jordanian and Lebanese nurses caring for refugees; (b) investigate the relationship between nurse related outcomes (physical health; emotional exhaustion) and their psychosocial work environment; and (c) assess the association between nurses' perceived work environment factors and implicit rationing of care and quality of patient care. Background Globally, the care of refugees is achieving increased attention. Over 6.3 million people are internally displaced and 4.8 million recorded Syrian expatriates are residing in and receiving healthcare services in the neighbouring host countries. Design This is a cross-sectional, comparative study using a survey design. Method The study setting involves both private and public hospitals and primary healthcare centres that provide care to refugees on regular basis in Lebanon and Jordan. The estimated sample size includes 3,000 Registered Nurses from Lebanon and 2,500 nurses and midwives from Jordan. Discussion Workplace factors affecting quality of nursing care and psychosocial status of nurses caring for refugees will be identified. Potential findings will help leaders design interventions to support nurses who are serving refugees for safer care and better patient outcomes. Findings will assist in more efficient resource allocation and management. Impact New knowledge on the impact of providing health care for refugees will be generated based on the structure of nursing care (e.g., work environment), on the nursing process (e.g., implicit rationing of care), and nurse outcomes (health) in two hosting communities. Moreover, factors enabling resilience in patients, providers, and systems will be identified and be of potential use in addressing the growing global problem of caring for displaced persons.

AB  - Abstract Child abuse is a significant social and public health problem in many societies. One particular form of physical abuse is inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI) ? the so-called ?Shaken Baby Syndrome?. One of the key features associated with ITBI is characteristic ocular findings ? only observed on fundal examination. It is crucial not to miss the diagnosis of ITBI as there may be implications for the safety of the child. The ophthalmologist is one key contributor to the process required to make the diagnosis of ITBI accurately and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. This article discusses some medicolegal implications of examining a child with retinal haemorrhages in the context of suspected ITBI, with practical advice for the ophthalmologist to be as objective and prepared as possible. The scientific validity of some alternative explanations advanced in court is discussed, with a strong emphasis on the literature.

AB  - Abstract We describe two cases of infanticide, two suspected infanticides, and a forced copulation by familiar resident males in two populations of wild spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth chamek and A. geoffroyi yucatanensis). These are the first known infanticides and forced copulation in spider monkeys. Data were gathered from four neighboring communities of spider monkeys in Manu National Park at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Peru and two communities in the Otoch Ma'ax Yetel Kooh Reserve at Punta Laguna, Mexico, during intensive field studies of over 2,000?hr each. These are rare behaviors, but results suggest that mating history and sexual coercion are important in spider monkey social relationships. Am. J. Primatol. 70:485?489, 2008. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of traumatic spino-pelvic dissociation (TSD) treated with modified bilateral triangular fixation. Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.

AB  - BACKGROUND Blood platelets (PLTs) are a valuable commodity. Management of their inventory has implications both for patient care and for the cost of health care delivery. There are a variety of different methods of managing PLT inventory currently in practice and multiple theoretical models aimed at improving PLT inventory metrics. In this study we evaluate the ability of a novel electronic dashboard system that monitors and displays both PLT inventory and patient data to improve transfusion metrics at a quaternary health care center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Capital District Health Authority is a quaternary health care center that transfuses approximately 2500 PLT units annually. To improve PLT discard rates a novel, low-overhead system that interfaces with the laboratory information system and displays real-time data between transfusion sites on PLT inventory and orders was implemented in November 2011. This study examines the transfusion quality metrics data from the 24 months before and after implementation. RESULTS A significant reduction in mean monthly PLT outdate rate was observed after the implementation of the PLT dashboard suite from 24.5% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%) to 15.1% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%; p?<?0.001). PLT age at time of transfusion was also reduced from 3.60 days (n?=?4796, SD?±?0.97 days) to 3.46 days (n?=?4881, SD?±?1.00 days; p?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the implementation of a novel PLT dashboard suite. This suite significantly reduced PLT outdate rates at our institution over the 48-month study period.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - The extent and kind of personal change experienced by newcomers during organizational socialization has not been thoroughly addressed. Studies have concentrated on increases in knowledge and adjustment and neglected the influence of starting work on sense of self. Multiple methods are used to explore graduates? accounts of change in early career. Questionnaires were sent to graduates in eight different organizations on two occasions one year apart (Time 1 N = 906; Time 2 N = 936). Graduates rated the amount of change they experienced highest in competence (median: Quite a lot), followed by career (median: A little), personality (median: A moderate amount/A little), values (median: Not at all/A little) and lowest in attitudes (median: Not at all). Content analysis of open-ended comments showed that changes were generally positive or neutral rather than negative. Discourses of personal change were explored in interviews with nine graduates who were selected as most likely to have experienced change. The criteria were that they were women in sex atypical occupations with high self-ratings of personal change. Accounts demonstrated the complexity and contradictions in defining and discussing change and the dilemma in both describing change and maintaining continuity. Narratives presented change as a response to adversity involving emotional control, increased self-knowledge and increased confidence. A further theme was the personal dilemma inherent in maintaining balance between the contested identities of self at work and outside. This research contributes to our understanding of newcomers? experiences of organizational socialization by emphasizing the importance of multiple methods to understand the ambiguity and ambivalence in complex developmental processes. It highlights the elusive nature of change and the complex negotiations in establishing the sense of self in different contexts.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multi-faceted, often chronic syndrome that may develop following an exposure to a highly-traumatic event. Given the complexity, heterogeneity, and incomplete theoretical description of this disorder, computational models of PTSD are an important tool to help understand the mechanisms, and course, of symptom presentation and maintenance in PTSD. This chapter reviews several computational modeling approaches and their implications for PTSD, including models focused on fear learning and expression, changes in arousal and reactivity, avoidance, changes in cognition and mood and intrusive recollection. It also discusses the limitations of each approach, and suggests possible directions for future research that could both advance our understanding of PTSD and help move toward a comprehensive computational account of this disorder.

AB  - ABSTRACT: One of the major sequelae following traumatic brain injury is a change in employment status. This poses significant challenges for rehabilitation services. Several studies have investigated the longer-term outcome after traumatic brain injury. Longer-term outcome in an economically disadvantaged rural environment with limited rehabilitation services has not been studied extensively. A group of individuals (n =65) who sustained a traumatic brain injury were compared regarding pre- and post-employment status. The moderate and severely injured sub-groups showed a significant change in employment status. Ideally rehabilitation programs should target re-employment as an outcome. Limited employment opportunities in rural areas may make this more difficult to achieve.

AB  - Two groups of children, one able-bodied and the other with physical disabilities, explored a symmetrical three-tiered virtual building that contained six distinctive target objects, two on each storey. In a subsequent test, the target objects were removed and participants were asked to make judgments of the directions to the former target locations from each floor in turn. At each test site, judgments were required for targets that were formerly on the same floor and for those on higher and lower floors. Relative tilt error scores suggested a bias for both groups, in that targets that were higher than the test location were judged as consistently lower than their actual position, whereas targets that were lower than the test location were judged as higher than their actual position. Absolute tilt errors revealed an asymmetry in both groups, with more accurate tilt errors for judgments directed to lower than higher floors. The relevance of these results for the source of the asymmetry is discussed.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the extent of visual recovery after multi-disciplinary approach of treatment in serious ocular injuries; to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor final visual outcome and suggest adequate precautionary measures. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 325 consecutive patients with direct ocular trauma who were examined and treated at a tertiary eye care centre in South India over a 3-year period was undertaken. Results: Males (86.8%) outnumbered the females (13.2%) and children (<16 years) constituted 46.8% of the total affected population. Anterior segment was involved in 51.1%, the posterior segment in 8.9% and both anterior and posterior segments were involved in 31.4% of patients. Prompt and meticulous surgical treatment restored useful vision (better than or equal to 6/18) in 60.5% of patients. Post-treatment, a reduction in blindness and visual impairment rates in the affected eye with respect to WHO classification was 66.7 and 54.1% respectively (P < 0.0001). Two eyes needed prompt enucleation. The factors associated with visual impairment (visual acuity less than 6/18) were poor initial visual acuity, full chamber hyphema, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and vitreous haemorrhage. Conclusions: Direct ocular trauma remains an important potentially preventable cause of ocular morbidity, but the advent of modern surgical techniques can often restore useful vision in such situations. Mandatory use of protective eye wear at work, public health education including awareness on the part of parents to the potential dangers of some childrens? toys can to an extent help reduce ocular morbidity due to direct ocular trauma.

AB  - This paper reviews the literature on human relational factors and their impact on complex care systems for a highly vulnerable population of children and young people in out-of-home care (OOHC). Factors contributing to the functioning of collaborative OOHC systems are reviewed from theoretical and contextual perspectives. The authors posit that secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma are central to understanding the impact of relational trauma and the experience of individuals, families, teams, and the wider ecology of collaborative care systems. Given the challenges of working collaboratively across interpersonal, family, and systems boundaries to support traumatised children in OOHC, further research is required.

AB  - Serial MRI facilitates the in vivo analysis of the intra- and intersubject evolution of traumatic brain injury lesions. Despite the availability of MRI, the natural history of experimental focal contusion lesions in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model has not been well described. We performed CCI on rats and MRI during the acute to chronic stages of cerebral injury to investigate the time course of changes in the brain. Female Wistar rats underwent CCI of their left motor cortex with a flat impact tip driven by an electromagnetic piston. In vivo MRI was performed at 7?T serially over 6?weeks post-CCI. The appearances of CCI-induced lesions and lesion-associated cortical volumes were variable on MRI, with the percentage change in cortical volume of the CCI ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side ranging from 18% within 2?h of injury on day 0 to a peak of 35% on day 1, and a trough of ?28% by week 5/6, with an average standard deviation of ±14% at any given time point. In contrast, the percentage change in cortical volume of the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side in control rats was not significant (1?±?2%). Hemorrhagic conversion within and surrounding the CCI lesion occurred between days 2 and 9 in 45% of rats, with no hemorrhage noted on the initial scan. Furthermore, hemorrhage and hemosiderin within the lesion were positive for Prussian blue and highly autofluorescent on histological examination. Although some variation in injuries may be technique related, the divergence of similar lesions between initial and final scans demonstrates the inherent biological variability of the CCI rat model.

AB  - Aims To develop and validate a scoring method for assessing ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) staining in cerebral white matter and to investigate the occurrence, amount and deposition pattern based on the cause of death in infants and young children. Methods Archival cerebral tissue was examined from a total of 176 cases (0 to 3 years of age). Each of the APP-stained sections was graded according to a simple scoring system based on the number and type of changes in eight anatomical regions. Results Examination of the sections revealed some degree of APP staining in 95% of the cases. The highest mean APP scores were found in cases of head trauma, and the lowest scores were found in the cases of drowning. APP staining, although sometimes minimal, was found in all 48 cases of and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Patterns of APP staining (the amount and distribution) were different in cases of head trauma, infection and SIDS but were similar in the SIDS and asphyxia groups. Conclusion This study demonstrates the use of an integrated scoring system that was developed to assess APP staining in the brain. APP staining was seen in a high proportion of cases, including relatively sudden deaths. The amount of APP was significantly higher in cases of trauma than in nontraumatic deaths. However, APP was detected within all groups. The pattern of APP staining was similar in infants who had died of SIDS and from mechanical asphyxia.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the move away from tradition and using only nursing experience towards a more questioning and research supported evidence-based practice (EBP) approach in orthopaedic and trauma nursing. The migration from the more narrow and specific use of research-based practice to the broader and encompassing use of evidence on which to base guidance and care decisions is explored. Weaknesses and strengths of adopting a culture of EBP nursing are addressed along with how to develop a search question, find and appraise the evidence, make sense of it and then apply the findings.

AB  - ABSTRACT Purpose Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although without strong evidence base. With substantial numbers of veterans returning from Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD, it is important to characterize the extent of SGA use and identify associated factors. Methods We determined time trends and patient characteristics associated with the use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD, without comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, using the Department of Veterans Affairs national administrative data 2003?2010. Results Among 732?085 veterans with PTSD, 27.6% received an intentional trial of an SGA in 2003?2010. The annual number treated with SGAs almost doubled (45?268 to 84?197, p?<?0.001), while prescribing rates decreased (28.6% to 21.5%, p?<?0.001). In multivariate analyses, African Americans (odds ratio (OR)?=?1.07, 95%confidence interval (CI)?=?1.06?1.09) and Hispanics (OR?= 1.13, 95%CI?=?1.10?1.17) were more likely to receive SGAs than Whites. Strongest clinical associations were with prior diagnosis of depression (OR?=?1.96; 95%CI?=?1.94?1.99), substance use disorders (OR?=?1.86; 95%CI?=?1.84?1.88), and other anxiety disorders (OR?=?1.27; 95%CI?=?1.26?1.29) (all p???<?0.0001) as well as cardiovascular risk factors. Veterans previously deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan had lower likelihood of SGA receipt. Substantial regional differences were demonstrated (South?>?Northeast; Midwest and West?<?Northeast; p?<?0.0001); regional administrative units (veterans integrated service networks) contributed minimally to regional differences. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder population growth is driving substantial increases in SGA use. Decreasing rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs prescribing may be due to integrated system-wide mechanisms (e.g., national practice guidelines), although regional variations remain prominent. These analyses provide foundational steps for identifying modifiable provider-level and organization-level determinants of SGA prescription in this growing population. Published 2013.
