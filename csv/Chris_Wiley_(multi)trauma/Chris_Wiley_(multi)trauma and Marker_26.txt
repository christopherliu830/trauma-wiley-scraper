AB  - Abstract: The high number of murder, rape, and child abuse cases in South Africa has led to increased numbers of bite mark cases being heard in high courts. Objective analysis to match perpetrators to bite marks at crime scenes must be able to withstand vigorous cross-examination to be of value in conviction of perpetrators. An analysis technique is described in four stages, namely determination of the mark to be a human bite mark, pattern association analysis, metric analysis and comparison with the population data, and illustrated by a real case study. New and accepted techniques are combined to determine the likelihood ratio of guilt expressed as one of a range of conclusions described in the paper. Each stage of the analysis adds to the confirmation (or rejection) of concordance between the dental features present on the victim and the dentition of the suspect. The results illustrate identification to a high degree of certainty.

AB  - Patients with burn shock can be challenging to resuscitate. Burn shock produces a variety of physiologic derangements: Patients are hypovolemic from volume loss, have a increased systemic vascular resistance, and may have a depressed cardiac output depending on the extent of the thermal injury. Additionally, the burn wound produces a significant inflammatory cascade of events that contributes to the shock state. Fluid resuscitation is foundational for the initial treatment of burn shock. Typical resuscitation is with intravenous lactated Ringer's in accordance with well-established formulas based on burn wound size. In the past century, as therapies to treat thermal injuries were being developed, plasma was the fluid used for burn resuscitation; in fact, plasma was used in World War II and throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Plasma was abandoned because of infectious risks and complications. Despite huge strides in transfusion medicine and the increased safety of blood products, plasma has never been readopted for burn resuscitation. Over the past 15 years, there has been a paradigm shift in trauma resuscitation: Less crystalloid and more blood products are used; this strategy has demonstrated improved outcomes. Plasma is a physiologic fluid that stabilizes the endothelium. The endotheliopathy of trauma has been described and is mitigated by transfusion strategies with a 1:1 ratio of RBCs to plasma. Thermal injury also results in endothelial dysfunction: the endotheliopathy of burns. Plasma is likely a better resuscitation fluid for patients with significant burn wounds because of its capability to restore intravascular volume status and treat the endotheliopathy of burns.

AB  - Rationale Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the recovery process post-stroke is essential; however, longer-term recovery studies are lacking. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) can image biological recovery processes, but is limited by spatial resolution and its targeted nature. Untargeted mass spectrometry imaging offers high spatial resolution, providing an ideal ex vivo tool for brain recovery imaging. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to image a rat brain 48 h after ischaemic stroke to locate the infarcted regions of the brain. PET was carried out 3 months post-stroke using the tracers [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO and [18F]IAM6067 for sigma-1 receptors to image neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, respectively. The rat brain was flash-frozen immediately after PET scanning, and sectioned for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging. Results Three months post-stroke, PET imaging shows minimal detection of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, indicating that the brain has stabilised. However, MALDI-MS images reveal distinct differences in lipid distributions (e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) between the scar and the healthy brain, suggesting that recovery processes are still in play. It is currently not known if the altered lipids in the scar will change on a longer time scale, or if they are stabilised products of the brain post-stroke. Conclusions The data demonstrates the ability to combine MALD-MS with in vivo PET to image different aspects of stroke recovery.

Conversations between the author and ?Gabrielle? explore two areas not regarded as priorities by Winnicott: the transgenerational transmission of pathology/trauma, and the ways that language, in general ? and given names, in particular ? organize individual subjectivity. The question raised is to what degree Winnicott ? who described the treatment as ?psychoanalysis partagé [shared]? due to the parents? involvement ? thought of the pathology itself as ?shared.? The goal is not to supplant but to expand Winnicott's understanding of the case, borrowing insights from the work of Lacan and others.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - The provision of adequate nutrition support for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a clinical challenge for decades. The primary and secondary injuries create unique metabolic derangements along with accompanying issues such as optimal timing and route of nutrition, appropriate fluid and electrolytes, drug administration, rehabilitation, and dysphagia. Enteral nutrition is clearly established as the preferential route of nutrition support for this population vs parenteral nutrition. There appears to be a consensus on early initiation of enteral nutrition, but less definitive are recommendations on advancement timing and formula components. Nutrition therapies should include exact fluid resuscitation goals specific for TBI and strict electrolyte monitoring to avoid extreme fluid, electrolyte, or glucose shifts that could be detrimental to the patient. While the critical care patient often tolerates small bowel feeding, the long-term rehabilitation patient should transition to and tolerate gastric feeding. Drug-nutrient and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea should be routinely evaluated in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Monitoring for dysphagia is critical to avoid the costly negative aspects associated with aspiration and to capitalize on quality of life and appropriate oral nutrition. Emphasizing the priority of early nutrition support within a multi-disciplinary team may be the critical key for successful provision and tolerance of nutrition support in the TBI population.

AB  - Abstract Immersion in time gives birth to consciousness, as well as conflict and torment. When human beings developed a sense of future, they also gained the ability to anticipate threats from nature or their fellow beings. They thereby created cultures that are bastions of survival, as well as places of poetry, art and religion where they could band together and reflect upon their common plight. The practice of psychoanalysis is in many ways a temporal process, a process of remembering, for owning and elaborating a past that gives us substance, thereby providing a basis for reflective consciousness. Stimulated by Freud's early writings, Lacan, Laplanche and their successors in particular have focussed extensively on time and psychoanalysis, and their views are a central point of this discussion. A substantial case study is offered that provides concrete examples of these perspectives. A multi-faceted view of temporality emerges, one that is more syncopated than linear or teleological. In conclusion, I will briefly discuss recent findings in the neuroscience of memory and ?time travel? that underpin contemporary psychoanalytic ideas in surprising ways. It is important to remember that acceptance of the contradictory nature of temporal experience can open space for increased freedom and playfulness.

AB  - Abstract Background: Bleeding is a major concern in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), as it may impede surgical progress and is often associated with complications. To improve the study and management of intraoperative bleeding, a standardized method of recording bleeding during ESS is needed. The aim of this study was to develop a standardized method of documenting bleeding in ESS and of grading the surgical field. Methods: Bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery was recorded using video-endoscopy. Standardized and non-standardized video-endoscopies of 20 patients were graded using a previously published grading scale (the Boezaart scale) in randomized order on two different occasions. Effects of standardization on intra- and interrater reliability were evaluated. Based on this experience, a new 11-point surgical field grading scale was developed and simultaneously compared with the six-point Boezaart scale via means of a DVD in three international centers. Results: Inter and intrarater reliability of the Boezaart and new Wormald scales significantly improved by employing a standardized video-endoscopy technique. The Wormald scale had significantly higher interrater (0.80 vs. 0.74, P < .001) and intrarater (0.89 vs. 0.83, P < .001) reliability than the Boezaart scale. Linear regression analysis revealed the Wormald scale to be more sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields experienced in ESS. Conclusion: Standardized video-endoscopy has been demonstrated to significantly improve reliability and reproducibility of results and is recommended for future work evaluating bleeding in ESS. The new Wormald grading scale has been shown to be an inexpensive, reliable, and sensitive tool to rapidly evaluate intraoperative bleeding in ESS. It overcomes several limitations of the Boezaart scale, enabling us to analyze currently employed and newly developed hemostatic methods and agents.

AB  - Impaired white matter integrity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to deficits in various neurological functions. The differentiation of the underlying pathological processes, e.g. edema, demyelination, axonal damage, to name a few, is of key clinical interest for the assessment of white matter injury. In this study, a combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI was used to study the spatiotemporal changes in white matter at 1?h, 3?h, and 1, 2, 7 and 14?days following TBI, using a rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. Based on radial diffusivity (RD), the rats were divided into two groups: group 1 showed widespread increases in RD along the corpus callosum of the ipsilesional hemisphere at day 2, and group 2 showed normal RD. Based on this group separation, group 1 also showed similar widespread changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2 at day 2, and group 2 showed normal FA and T2. The widespread changes in RD and T2 in group 1 on day 2 were apparently dominated by edema, which obscured possible myelin and axonal damage. In contrast, the susceptibility of group 1 showed more localized increases near the impact site on day 2, and otherwise similar contrast to the contralesional hemisphere. The localized susceptibility increase is probably a result of demyelination and axonal injury. The extent of brain damage between the two groups revealed by MRI was consistent with behavioral results, with the first group showing significantly increased forelimb asymmetry and increased forelimb foot fault deficits. Our results suggest that the combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI may provide an opportunity for the differential assessment of edema and axonal damage in TBI.

AB  - Abstract Much of the extant literature addressing the psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2 mutation testing and risk management aggregates mutation carriers of all ages in study recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation. This analytic strategy does not adequately address the needs of the youngest genetic testing consumers, i.e., women aged 18?25. Despite low absolute cancer risk estimates before age 30, BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women aged 18?25 feel vulnerable to a cancer diagnosis but find themselves in a management quandary because the clinical utility of screening and prevention options are not yet well defined for such young carriers. We present three cases, selected from a larger study of 32 BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women who completed or considered genetic testing before age 25, to demonstrate the unique developmental, relational and temporal influences, as well as the challenges, experienced by very young BRCA mutation-positive women as they complete genetic testing and initiate cancer risk management. The first case describes the maturation of a young woman whose family participated in a national cancer registry. The second addresses the experiences and expectations of a young woman who completed genetic testing after learning that her unaffected father was a mutation carrier. The third case highlights the experiences of a young woman parentally bereaved in childhood, who presented for genetic counseling and testing due to intense family pressure. Together, these cases suggest that BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18?25 are challenged to reconcile their burgeoning independence from their families with risk-related support needs. Loved ones acting in ways meant to care for these young women may inadvertently apply pressure, convoluting family support dynamics and autonomous decision-making. Ongoing support from competent healthcare professionals will enable these young women to remain informed and receive objective counsel about their risk-management decisions.

AB  - Abstract Fascia in the veterinary sciences is drawing attention, such that physiotherapists and animal practitioners are now applying techniques based on the concept of fascia studies in humans. A comprehensive study of fascia is therefore needed in animals to understand the arrangement of the fascial layers in an unguligrade horse and a digitigrade dog. This study has examined the difference between the horse and the dog fascia at specific regions, in terms of histology, and has compared it with the human model. Histological examinations show that in general the fascia tissue of the horse exhibits a tight and dense composition, while in the dog it is looser and has non-dense structure. Indeed, equine fascia appears to be different from both canine fascia and the human fascia model, whilst canine fascia is very comparable to the human model. Although regional variations were observed, the superficial fascia (fascia superficialis) in the horse was found to be trilaminar in the trunk, yet multilayered in the dog. Moreover, crimping of collagen fibers was more visible in the horse than the dog. Blood vessels and nerves were present in the loose areolar tissue of the superficial and the profound compartment of hypodermis. The deep fascia (fascia profunda) in the horse was thick and tightly attached to the underlying muscle, while in the dog the deep fascia was thin and loosely attached to underlying structures. Superficial and deep fascia fused in the extremities. In conclusion, gross dissection and histology have revealed species variations that are related to the absence or presence of the superficial adipose tissue, the retinacula cutis superficialis, the localization and amount of elastic fibers, as well as the ability to slide and glide between the different layers. Further research is now needed to understand in more detail whether these differences have an influence on the biomechanics, movements and proprioception of these animals.

AB  - Highlights The experiences of detained youth may rest predominantly in their interactions with detention staff. This study examined rehabilitative practices infused within the daily activities of detention staff. We found evidence for three categories of rehabilitative practices embedded in staff activities. Our findings can be used to build staff members? capacity to bridge service gaps in detention.

AB  - Aim:? Functional neuroimaging studies to date have indicated prefrontal dysfunction in late-onset major depression (LOD). The relationships between prefrontal dysfunction and clinical characteristics including social functioning, however, have been unclear. The objective of the present study was to evaluate prefrontal hemodynamic response related to an executive task in LOD and to assess the relationship between activation in the prefrontal regions and clinical characteristics including social functioning. Methods:? Twenty-four subjects with LOD and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the present study. Hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal and superior temporal cortical surface area were measured during verbal fluency task (VFT) using 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which enables real-time monitoring of cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the cortical surface area. Results:? The two groups had a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of oxy-hemoglobin concentration change; LOD patients had less activation in a broad area covering both prefrontal and superior temporal cortices than healthy controls. In addition, reduced activation of the frontopolar region had a significant positive correlation with lower self-assessment of social functioning scores in the patient group. Conclusion:? Reduced frontopolar cortical activation was associated with social functioning impairment in patients with LOD, and NIRS may be an efficient clinical tool for monitoring these characteristics.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury causes post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). About ?50% of patients rupturing their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) will develop PTOA within 1?2 decades of the injury, yet the mechanisms responsible for the development of PTOA after joint injury are not well understood. In this study, we examined whole joint gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) at 1 day, 1-, 6-, and 12 weeks post injury, in a non-invasive tibial compression (TC) overload mouse model of PTOA that mimics ACL rupture in humans. We identified 1446 genes differentially regulated between injured and contralateral joints. This includes known regulators of osteoarthritis such as MMP3, FN1, and COMP, and several new genes including Suco, Sorcs2, and Medag. We also identified 18 long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the injured joints. By comparing our data to gene expression data generated using the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) PTOA model, we identified several common genes and shared mechanisms. Our study highlights several differences between these two models and suggests that the TC model may be a more rapidly progressing model of PTOA. This study provides the first account of gene expression changes associated with PTOA development and progression in a TC model. ? 2016 The Authors.
