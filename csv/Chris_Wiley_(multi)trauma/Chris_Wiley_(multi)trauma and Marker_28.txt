AB  - Abstract A biogeographic estimate of a certain population can not only discern population substructure in the whole genome association study, but also provide informative clues for forensic investigations when obtained DNA genotypes do not find a match in the available forensic DNA database. In this study, 100 ancestry informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (AISNPs) were first presented to differentiate three continental ancestries (African, East Asian and European). Ultimately, forty-two AISNPs were chosen from the 100 AISNPs. Distinguishing power of the 100 and 42 AISNPs for differentiating continental populations was further evaluated with population cluster analyses. Results indicated both of AISNP sets could efficiently differentiate 11 training populations from the three continents. Further validation of 42 AISNPs in testing population set indicated these 42 AISNPs performed well for ancestry inferences of these testing individuals. Ancestry components of Uyghur group were assessed by comparing with different continental populations based on these 42 AISNPs. Results revealed that East Asian populations contributed more ancestry components to the studied Uyghur group than European populations. In conclusion, our study is expected to provide more AISNP markers and enrich extant reference database.

AB  - Abstract This review covers the most recent clinical and surgical advances made in the development and application of cochlear implants (CIs). In recent years, dramatic progress has been made in both clinical and basic science aspect of cochlear implantation. Today's modern CI uses multi-channel electrodes with highly miniaturized powerful digital processing chips. This review article describes the function of various components of the modern multi-channel CIs. A selection of the most recent clinical and surgical innovations is presented. This includes the preliminary results with electro-acoustic stimulation or hybrid devices and ongoing basic science research that is focused on the preservation of residual hearing post-implantation. The result of an original device that uses a binaural stimulation mode with a single implanted receiver/stimulator is also presented. The benefit and surgical design of a temporalis pocket technique for the implant's receiver stimulator is discussed. Advances in biomedical engineering and surgical innovations that lead to an increasingly favorable clinical outcome and to an expansion of the indication of CI surgery are presented and discussed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Soft tissue defects of the digits can be a challenging problem for the hand surgeon. For non-graftable defects, numerous local, regional and free flaps have been described for resurfacing, each with their own limitations ? bulk, colour, texture mismatch, donor morbidity. Perforator flaps increasingly provide the optimal option for reconstruction of digital defects as they are thin, pliable and with low donor site morbidity. Methods A thin, pliable fasciocutaneous flap can be raised from the distal volar forearm based on a perforator of the radial artery. The pedicle is up to 2?3?cm in length with a diameter of at least 0.5?mm in diameter, suitable for anastomosis to the digital artery. Venous drainage is via the venae comitante of the radial artery and superficial volar veins. Results A patient presented to our emergency department following circular saw injuries. He suffered multi-digit trauma with subsequent soft tissue defects over the dorsum of the digit. Reconstructive requirements were met utilizing a free fasciocutaneous flap raised on a distal volar forearm perforator from the radial artery. The recovery was uneventful with no donor site morbidity. Discussion Dorsal digital soft tissue reconstruction requires thin, pliable, ideally hairless and sensate skin. Most locoregional options are limited by the need for multi-stage surgery, bulk, limited reach or donor site morbidity. In our patient, the reconstructive requirements were met with preservation of the radial artery. While it requires microsurgical skill and instruments, this flap provides another option for the reconstructive hand surgeon.

AB  - Abstract Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by corneal endothelial abnormalities, which can lead to blindness due to loss of corneal transparency and sometimes glaucoma. We mapped a new locus responsible for PPCD in a family in which we excluded the previously reported PPCD locus on 20q11, and the region containing COL8A2 on chromosome 1. Results of a 317-marker genome scan provided significant evidence of linkage of PPCD to markers on chromosome 10, with single-point LOD scores of 2.63, 1.63, and 3.19 for markers D10S208 (at $\hat \theta = 0.03$), D10S1780 (at $\hat \theta = 0.00$), and D10S578 (at $\hat \theta = 0.06$). A maximum multi-point LOD score of 4.35 was found at marker D10S1780. Affected family members shared a haplotype in an 8.55 cM critical interval that was bounded by markers D10S213 and D10S578. Our finding of another PPCD locus, PPCD3, on chromosome 10 indicates that PPCD is genetically heterogeneous. Guttae, a common corneal finding sometimes observed along with PPCD, were found among both affected and unaffected members of the proband's sib ship, but were absent in the younger generations of the family. Evaluation of phenotypic differences between family members sharing the same affected haplotype raises questions about whether differences in disease severity, including differences in response to surgical interventions, could be due to genetic background or other factors independent of the PPCD3 locus. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with management of the post-traumatic brain-injured person with specific reference to cognitive and behavioural aspects. The information is occupational therapy specific but is also relevant to the whole rehabilitation team as well as for families and carers of head-injured people. Although each individual who sustains a head injury is unique and therefore will need individual attention, the deficits which result and the most appropriate rehabilitation goals for head-injured people have a commonality and can be applied generally. Behavioural management begins once the person with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is able to focus, learn and put into practice the techniques taught to control behaviour. The cognitive impairments in a brain-injured client that are considered are those that become evident in hospital after coming out of a coma but which persist once the client has been discharged.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - SUMMARY Objective To document blood component usage in the UK medical treatment facility, Afghanistan, over a period of 4 years; and to examine the relationship with transfusion capability, injury pattern and survival. Background Haemostatic resuscitation is now firmly established in military medical practice, despite the challenges of providing such therapy in austere settings. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of blood component use in service personnel admitted for trauma. Data were extracted from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Results A total of 2618 patients were identified. Survival increased from 76 to 84% despite no change in injury severity. The proportion of patients receiving blood components increased from 13 to 32% per annum; 417 casualties received massive transfusion (≥10 units of RCC), the proportion increasing from 40 to 62%. Use of all blood components increased significantly in severely injured casualties, to a median (IQR) of 16 (9?25) units of red cell concentrate (P?=?0·006), 15 (8?24) of plasma (P?=?0·002), 2 (0?5) of platelets (P?<?0·001) and 1 (0?3) of cryoprecipitate (P?<?0·001). Cryoprecipitate (P?=?0·009) and platelet use (P?=?0·005) also increased in moderately injured casualties. Conclusions The number of blood components transfused to individual combat casualties increased during the 4-year period, despite no change in injury severity or injury pattern. Survival also increased. Combat casualties requiring massive transfusion have a significantly higher chance of survival than civilian patients. Survival is the product of the entire system of care. However, we propose that the changes in military transfusion practice and capability have contributed to increased combat trauma survival.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Symptom checklists and a follow-up questionnaire were mailed to the first 180 graduates of an inpatient Post Traumatic Stress Treatment program. Eighty-six of the 180 responded to the survey. Their responses were compared to measures obtained on them while they were inpatients at the treatment program. Significant differences were found on one symptom checklist, while positive trends toward symptom reduction were noted on another. Demographic characteristics of the respondents were dicusssed, as were responses to open-ended questions regarding in what ways the program helped most and least. Changes in a positive direction were noted in the area of self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and symptoms of numbing and arousal. PTSD-related intrusive symptoms had the least clear-cut improvement. Implications of these findings for inpatient treatment and aftercare are reviewed, with suggestions for future applied research.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate the utility of a multi-echo sequence at 7 Tesla (T) for simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) MR-angiography (MRA) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of radiation-induced cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), intracranial arteries, and veins. Methods A four-echo gradient-echo sequence was implemented on a 7T scanner. The first echo was used to create TOF-MRA images, while the remaining echoes were combined to visualize CMBs and veins on SWI images. The sequence was evaluated on eight brain tumor patients with known radiation-induced CMBs. Single-echo images were also acquired to visually and quantitatively compare the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of small- and intermediate-vessels between acquisitions. The number of CMBs detected with each acquisition was also quantified. Statistical significance was determined using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Compared with the single-echo sequences, the CNR of small and intermediate arteries increased 7.6% (P?<?0.03) and 9.5% (P?=?0.06), respectively, while the CNR of small and intermediate veins were not statistically different between sequences (P?=?0.95 and P?=?0.46, respectively). However, these differences were not discernible by visual inspection. Also the multi-echo sequence detected 18.3% more CMBs (P?<?0.008) due to higher slice resolution. Conclusion The proposed 7T multi-echo sequence depicts arteries, veins, and CMBs on a single image to facilitate quantitative evaluation of radiation-induced vascular injury. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine in vivo high-resolution morphological and biochemical gender related differences in cartilage repair tissue (MACT). Forty patients were examined clinically and by MR scans at 3T-MRI (coronal 3D True-FISP sequence for morphologic assessment and multi-echo spin-echo T2-mapping for biochemical assessment of healthy cartilage and MACT cartilage). Mean T2 values in repair tissue in the deep zone showed significantly shorter T2 times in females (p?=?0.009, female 43.5?±?9.8 vs. male 48.2?±?7.7?ms). The superficial zone showed higher T2 values than the deep zone in both the groups (female 48.5?±?9.8, males 52.6?±?11.0?ms) without significant difference between female and male patients. Native control cartilage showed no statistically significant differences for T2 between females and males. The subdivisions ?structure of the repair tissue? and ?subchondral bone? of the MOCART score showed statistically significant differences between females and males (p?=?0.026 and p?=?0.007) as well as the Lysholm score (p?=?0.03). Our investigations revealed differences between female and male patients after MACT of the knee in clinical outcome and advanced morphological and biochemical MRI. The presented imaging biomarkers can depict subtle changes after cartilage regeneration procedures and might help to understand gender related differences after cartilage repair procedures. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Data were managed using NVivo software and synthesized using thematic analysis to elicit meaning. Results:? The review synthesized a substantial number (n?=?273) of participant experiences of traumatic surviving life-threatening injury and revealed that during the initial 3 years following life-threatening injury, the individual goes through a shifting, iterative process in order to reconstruct various aspects of their injury and themselves, including mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and relational facets. Three major themes were illuminated: a time of chaos, negotiating injury and reconciling injury. In order to navigate through the experience of injury, family members were key sources of affirmation and support in anchoring the person to their life, in reconstructing themselves in the aftermath of injury and in coming to terms with the impacts of injury. Conclusion:? This qualitative synthesis describes the iterative process individuals go through following life-threatening injury and the overwhelming need to reconstruct aspects of self as a way to create meaning. It demonstrates the need to gain further understanding of the influence of the family in recovery from injury and indicates that education is required to provide practical strategies to assist clinicians to develop appropriate and relevant patient goals and expectations.

AB  - Abstract Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), further mild impacts can exacerbate negative outcomes. To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p > 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To use a new approach which provides, based on the widely used three-dimensional double-echo steady-state (DESS) sequence, in addition to the morphological information, the generation of biochemical T2 maps in one hybrid sequence. Materials and Methods: In 50 consecutive MRIs at 3.0 Tesla (T) after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) of the knee, by the use this new DESS-T2d approach, the morphological Magnetic resonance Observation of CArtilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, as well as biochemical T2d values were assessed. Furthermore, these results were correlated to standard morphological sequences as well as to standard multi-echo spin-echo T2 mapping. Results: The MOCART score correlated (Pearson:0.945; P < 0.001) significantly as assessed with standard morphological sequences (68.8 ± 13.2) and the morphological images of the DESS T2d sequence (68.7 ± 12.6). T2 and T2d relaxation times (ms) were comparable in between the control cartilage (T2: 52.5 ± 11.4; T2d: 46.6 ± 10.3) and the repair tissue (T2: 54.4 ± 11.4; T2d: 47.5 ± 13.0) (T2: P = 0.157; T2d: P = 0.589). As expected, T2d values were lower than the standard-T2 values, however, both functional relaxation times correlated significantly (Pearson:0.429; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The presented hybrid approach provides the possibility to combine morphological and biochemical MRI in one fast 3D sequence, and thus, may attract for the clinical use of biochemical MRI.

AB  - Objective Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a key role in the aetiology and serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We performed a genomewide analysis to identify genes whose DNA methylation levels are associated with PTSD. Method A total of 211 individuals comprising Australian male Vietnam War veterans (n = 96) and males from a general population belonging to the Grady Trauma Project (n = 115) were included. Genomewide DNA methylation was performed from peripheral blood using the Illumina arrays. Data analysis was performed using generalized linear regression models. Results Differential DNA methylation of 17 previously reported PTSD candidate genes was associated with PTSD symptom severity. Genomewide analyses revealed CpG sites spanning BRSK1, LCN8, NFG and DOCK2 genes were associated with PTSD symptom severity. We replicated the findings of DOCK2 in an independent cohort. Pathway analysis revealed that among the associated genes, genes within actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion molecular pathways were enriched. Conclusion These data highlight the role of DNA methylation as biomarkers of PTSD. The results support the role of previous candidates and uncover novel genes associated with PTSD, such as DOCK2. This study contributes to our understanding of the biological underpinnings of PTSD.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic experiences. We propose a socio-interpersonal model of PTSD that complements existing models of post-traumatic memory processes or neurobiological changes. The model adds an interpersonal perspective to explain responses to traumatic stress. The framework draws from lifespan psychology, cultural psychology and research into close relationships and groups. Additionally, clinical knowledge about PTSD is incorporated. This involves knowledge about shame, guilt, estrangement feelings and protective factors, such as social support and forgiveness. Three levels are proposed at which relevant interpersonal processes can be situated and should be adequately researched. First, the individual level comprises social affective states, such as shame, guilt, anger and feelings of revenge. Second, at the close relationship level, social support, negative exchange (ostracism and blaming the victim), disclosure and empathy are proposed as dyadic processes relevant to PTSD research and treatment. Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and social acknowledgement are concepts that predict the response trajectories to traumatic stress. Research by the current authors and others is cited in an effort to promote future investigation based on the current model. Methodological implications, such as multi-level data analyses, and clinical implications, such as the need for couple, community or larger-level societal interventions, are both outlined. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The socio-interpersonal model proposes an interpersonal view of the processes that occur in the aftermath of a traumatic experience. At the individual level, the model integrates the social affective phenomena that clinical research identifies in PTSD patients, including shame, guilt, anger, revenge and the urges or reluctance to disclose. At the level of close relationships, there is an emphasis on the role of the individuals' partner, family or social support in the development or maintenance of PTSD and its recovery. At the distant social level, societal and cultural factors, e.g., individualistic versus collectivistic or other human value orientations, are acknowledged as contributing to the severity and course of PTSD. Increasing attention should be given to new approaches of PTSD treatment that refer to an interpersonal view of PTSD, e.g., communication training, PTSD-specific couples' therapy or community programs.
