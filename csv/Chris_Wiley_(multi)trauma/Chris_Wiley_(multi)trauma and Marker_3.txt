AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Abstract:? Suicide is a deliberate act of ending one?s life. Suicide by use of any explosive device, when not involved in a terrorist act, is quite rare in occurrence when compared with other methods routinely utilized. In this paper, we present to the medicolegal community a case of an adult male who committed suicide with blasting caps and the subsequent extensive damage to the cranial hard tissue. Although the cause and manner of death were relatively straightforward, consultation with forensic anthropologists was requested for an anthropological trauma assessment of the highly fragmented skull. After the skull was cleaned and reconstructed, the analysis revealed similarities between blasting cap trauma to the head and high velocity gunshot trauma to the head. Therefore, in a case where some evidence may have been removed or destroyed, forensic analysis involving trauma of this magnitude could result in a misinterpretation of the true mechanism responsible for the osseous damage. In this case, cooperation among the law enforcement agency, coroner?s investigators, the forensic pathologist, and forensic anthropologists provided a comprehensive death case analysis.

AB  - Abstract Much of the theoretical focus in post-traumatic stress disorder has been on the role of the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Crucially, in unresolved traumatic experiences that underlie clinical presentations, this focus misses the brain areas key to the defence responses of fight, flight and freeze?and the associated affects of anger, fear and grief. The periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, with the hypothalamus, is essential for these somatic and emotional responses to traumatic experiences. We argue that when treatment approaches thought to work at the higher brain levels have been ineffective, it is because they have failed to engage the midbrain and hypothalamic sources of the affective responses to the trauma and to the memory of it. Basic affects have been so overwhelming that dissociation, or a similarly protective neurochemical capping mechanism, has prevented full resolution of the affective content of the adversity. Treatment with the Comprehensive Resource Model? (CRM) aims to clear the clinically relevant residues of adverse experiences by resolving the emotional responses accessed through the body memories. When the trauma has led to overwhelming distress, and/or dissociation, there is a necessity for robust resourcing to be in place before the emotional intensity of that distress is accessed. Resourcing needs to be as proximal to the re-experience as possible to promote complete resolution and in some psychotherapy modalities, the supports provided are somewhat remote from the crucial moments of processing. Therefore, we describe how the CRM seeks to have robustly resourced states present concurrently with traumatised states to avoid overwhelming emotional distress. This allows safe entry into the deepest pain residual from the traumatic event so that it is not overwhelming during processing of the memory, and does not lead to further dissociation, allowing the individual to remain fully present throughout. This ?stepping into the affect? can then be so rapidly effective that we also argue that CRM is not an exposure treatment; re-orientation to the deepest content of the experience resolves the residual distress quickly and permanently through memory reconsolidation. Re-learning at upper brain levels will then follow from the revoking of the affective power, which has previously driven stimulus/context and response learning in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To assess the effect of esmolol vs lidocaine to attenuate the detrimental rise in heart rate and blood pressure during intubation of patients with isolated head trauma. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, performed at an urban, county teaching emergency department. Participants were 30 patients with isolated head trauma. Each underwent a standardized intubation protocol including esmolol or lidocaine, both at 2 mg/kg. Results: Esmolol was used in 16 patients and lidocaine in 14. Mechanisms of injury included 12 assaults, 6 motor vehicle collisions, 6 falls, 4 auto-vs-pedestrian crashes, and 2 bicycle incidents. Mean ethanol level was 0.116 ± 0.133 SD (range 0-0.482). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7.9 ± 4.0 SD. Cranial computed tomography (CT) hemorrhagic findings included 9 subdural/epidural hematomas, 6 cortex hemorrhages, and 2 multi-hemorrhages. Eleven patients received surgical intervention: 9 patients received a craniotomy, and 2 a ventricular catheter. The 2-minute time interval around intubation was used to assess each drug's efficacy. The mean difference change between groups for heart rate was 4.0 beats/min (95% CI = -17.7 to 9.7 beats/min), for systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.8 to 30.4 mm Hg), and for diastolic blood pressure was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.1 to 21.9 mm Hg). The power of this study was 90% to detect a 20-beat/min difference in heart rate, a 35-mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure, and a 20-mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Esmolol and lidocaine have similar efficacies to attenuate moderate hemodynamic response to intubation of patients with isolated head trauma.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims In 2005 the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate requiring that level I trauma centers have mechanisms to identify and intervene with problem drinkers. The aim of this investigation was to determine if a multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation enhancements. Design Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n?=?10, patient n?=?409) providers received 1-day workshop training on evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four 30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n?=?10, patient n?=?469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements. Setting Trauma centers in the United States of America. Participants A total of 878 blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). Measurements MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Findings Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of the year after injury (relative risk?=?0.88, 95%, confidence interval?=?0.79, 0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P?=?0.002). Conclusion Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among patients without TBI.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Summary An animal trauma triage (ATT) scoring system was devised to provide stratification of veterinary trauma patient populations based upon severity of injury. A retrospective population of 101 trauma patients and a prospective population of 88 patients were used to evaluate the predictive power of the ATT scoring system for survival seven days after initial presentation of the emergency service. In Both groups, the mean ATT score for survivors was significantly lower than the mean ATT score for non-survivors. In a logistic regression mode, the ATT score was found to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of survival seven days after initial presentation for both populartions. Each point increase in the ATT score resulted in a 2.3?2.6 times decreased likelihood of survival. The ATT scoring system is a useful objective classification scheme for predicting the likelihood to survive a traumatic incident and can serve as prototype for severity of injuroy scoring systems for the veterinary trauma patient.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients, second hits are known to potentiate the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, thus increasing the risk of multi-organ dysfunction. In accordance with ?damage control orthopaedic surgery? principles, fractures are initially treated with external fixators, which are replaced by internal osteosynthesis once the immunological status of the patient is considered stable. Recently, we demonstrated that a severe trauma impaired the healing of fractures stabilized by external fixation during the entire healing period. The question arose, whether switching to intramedullary nailing increases the inflammatory response in terms of a second hit, leading to a further impairment of bone healing. Wistar rats received a femoral osteotomy stabilized by an external fixator. Simultaneously half of the rats underwent an additional thoracic trauma. After 4 days, the external fixator was replaced by an intramedullary nail in half of the rats of the two groups. The inflammatory response was evaluated by measuring serum C5a levels. Fracture healing was determined by three-point-bending, µCT, and histomorphometry. The thoracic trauma significantly increased C5a concentrations 6, 24, and 72?h after the second surgical intervention. After 40 days, conversion to intramedullary nailing considerably decreased the flexural rigidity of the callus, with no significant differences between rats with or without thoracic trauma. After 47 days, flexural rigidity in rats subjected to conversion remained decreased compared to animals solely treated by external fixation, particularly in combination with blunt chest trauma. The results indicate that accumulation of second hits after multiple injuries could lead to aggravation of the fracture healing outcome. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - Existing research suggests that approximately 19% of females experience childhood sexual trauma (CST). Little is known, however, about the parenting behaviour of mothers who have experienced CST. Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines prenatal psychosocial distress, postnatal depressive symptomatology, and caregiving behaviours of women reporting CST at or before the age of 14. Data for these analyses were obtained from mother reports and from observational protocols from a longitudinal study of low-income, rural families. Propensity score methodology was used to create a contrast group matched on family of origin variables in an effort to isolate and examine the long-term associations of CST beyond the effects of other childhood adversities such as poverty. Study findings provide evidence that women with CST histories report greater prenatal psychosocial distress compared to women without trauma histories. Findings further provide evidence for a spillover process from prenatal distress to the broader caregiving system including less sensitive parenting through postnatal depressive symptoms for women with CST histories. These results highlight the importance of screening for CST and psychosocial distress and depression prenatally. Interventions for women with CST histories and directions for future study are proposed. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Non Violent Resistance (NVR) aims to change family relationships, when children and young people show violent, aggressive or self-destructive behaviour. Trauma in multi-stressed families necessitates an adaptation of the original NVR approach in order to meet these clients' specific therapeutic needs when child violence arises. The author has developed such an adaptation. This article gives an overview of the larger system aspect of the adapted NVR model, illustrating how NVR core principles are applied to help family members develop a sense of safety within the larger system, so the nuclear family itself can become a safe and supportive recovery environment. Practitioner points By differentiating between interaction patterns, parents identify safe supporters within the larger system to help develop effective responses to harmful child behaviour Therapeutic conversation centres parents? own formulation of their support needs, in order to regain their voice and experience personal agency Effective resistance to problem behaviour grows by engaging other adults in ways that facilitate parents? access to internal and interpersonal resources

AB  - ABSTRACT This article examines two novels by seminal German-language Jewish authors, Benjamin Stein's Die Leinwand (2010) and Eva Menasse's Quasikristalle (2013), to shed light on major shifts in Holocaust memory since the turn of the millennium. I argue that developments such as the disappearance of the eyewitness generation, coupled with the increasing hypermediation and globalisation of Holocaust memories, force us to reconsider certain conceptions of trauma which for a long time have dominated engagements with the Holocaust and its representation. Instead of approaching Holocaust trauma as unspeakable and inherently inaccessible, I propose to read the novels? engagements with the Holocaust through the lens of Terri Tomsky's concept of ?travelling trauma?, which allows us to conceive of the Holocaust as a culturally mediated signifier that moves transgenerationally, transmedially, and transnationally through various discursive networks. The novels by Stein and Menasse furthermore enable us to examine critically certain manifestations of ?travelling trauma? and the current state of Holocaust representation in a way that Tomsky's more descriptive approach does not.

AB  - Abstract Background The rate of hospitalization in elderly patients because of falls is increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term trends in injury profiles of low-energy falls and to identify injuries associated with need for in-patient rehabilitation. Methods A single-centre retrospective study was performed at an inner city Major Trauma Centre in Sydney. Trauma registry data were obtained from patients who were 65 years of age or over with low-energy falls (trip and fall from height ≤1?m, including falls from standing) from the trauma registry between January 2000 and December 2011. Demographic data, time and date of presentation and injury characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interests were proportions of hip fractures, head injuries and discharge to in-patient rehabilitation facilities. Results A total of 4964 cases were identified. There was a 6.5% per annum decrease in the proportion of elderly patients with low-energy falls who sustained hip fractures compared with a relative increase in severe head injuries, 5.7% per annum. Around 25% of patients were transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Severe head injuries and lower-limb injuries were the two injuries most associated with transfer to in-patient rehabilitation. Conclusion In elderly patients with low-energy falls, a significant decrease in hip fractures was associated with a rise in severe head injuries over the past decade.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of serum fibronectin and serum somatomedin-C as nutritional markers during enteral nutrition support (ENS) of critically ill, traumatized patients using an enteral product containing high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
