AB  - Knowledge on interplay between the cardiac molecular response to transplantation-induced stress and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is limited. A cDNA array identified HIF-1, EGR-1, NAB-2, VEGF-A and uPA as mediators of cardiac tissue response to transplantation-induced stress. mRNA expression of these molecules was measured in left ventricular biopsies from 200 donors before and after aortic cross-clamping and at 10-, 30- and 60-min reperfusion by real-time RT-PCR. HIF-1α expression at two time points was significantly associated with PGD, as shown by univariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariate logistic regression. At a cut-off level of 200 arbitrary units, HIF-1α after aortic cross-clamping in donors (78% sensitivity, 83% specificity) and at 10-min reperfusion (85% sensitivity, 83% specificity) identified PGD. HIF-1α demonstrates the potential to be a predictive marker for PGD; however, as multiple factors were tested at different time points, prospective evaluation is clearly necessary to confirm this observation.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study was carried out to determine the time and concentration profile required to achieve vancomycin-mediated eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. This information is critical for the identification of performance targets for local antibiotic delivery vehicles that target biofilm infections. S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms were grown for 7 days on titanium?aluminium?niobium discs in Mueller Hinton broth. After 7 days, the discs were then incubated in Mueller Hinton broth containing vancomycin at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000?mg/L. Biofilm eradication was assessed under both static and shaking conditions. Samples were retrieved at regular intervals for up to 28 days for quantification of residual biofilm. One additional disc was processed per time point for scanning electron microscopy. Progressive and significant reduction of viable bacteria was observed over time at all concentrations compared to unexposed controls. After 28 days under static conditions, the S. aureus biofilm was completely eradicated at 200?mg/L vancomycin and higher concentrations, but not at 100?mg/L. In contrast, bacterial biofilm could not be eradicated under shaking conditions at any concentration. Clinical significance: The present study shows that it is possible to eradicate mature S. aureus biofilm from metal implants by vancomycin alone although the time concentration profile required cannot be achieved by systemic administration or any of the local delivery vehicles currently available. Identifying targets for antibiotic delivery is the first step in developing fit for purpose local antibiotic delivery vehicles that will successfully and predictably treat established biofilm infection. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. Methods Cognitive and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged?≥?65 years (n?=?23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n?=?69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n?=?23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio?≥?1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios?=?0.95?±?0.15, 1.11?±?0.18 [p?<?0.0001], and 1.14?±?0.17 [p?=?0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74?83.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of a chronic illness is described as an upsetting event that implies an emotional crisis for parents. Some are able to come to terms with their child's chronic condition and feel a sense of resolution, but for others, strong negative emotions persist through time. The present study examines diagnostic resolution among parents of teenagers with a transplant. The design was qualitative and involved individual interviews with nine parents. Five were donor to their child. Data were analyzed according to the principles of IPA. Early reactions to the diagnosis suggest that parents with an unresolved status experienced trauma. Many factors seem to contribute to diagnostic resolution such as good communication between spouses, positive relationship with the medical staff, and being the parent donor. For all parents, concerns over adherence are central to their relationship with their youth. Results call attention to the support needs of all parents and particularly those with an unresolved status.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims Fragment reattachment is a procedure that offers advantages, such as preservation of tooth structure and maintenance of color, shape, and translucency of the original tooth. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment techniques used to restore anterior teeth fractured by trauma. Materials and Methods The PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched in October 2016, and the search was updated in February 2017. A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data. In vitro studies that evaluated permanent human teeth fractured by trauma were included. Results Twenty-one studies remained after screening. The bond strength between the fragment and the crown was evaluated in 119 experimental groups. Ten different techniques were evaluated as follows: no preparation, chamfer, bevel, anchors, overcontour, internal groove, no preparation associated with chamfer after reattachment, fragment dentin removal associated with chamfer after reattachment, bevel associated with overcontour, and groove associated with shoulder. Five different materials were used to reattach the fragment: bonding system, luting composite resin, flowable composite, microhybrid composite, and nanocomposite. Conclusion Fragment reattachment using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth.

AB  - Objective.? To examine whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) are associated with an increased risk of migraine in the general population and to examine whether migraine is associated with an increase risk of MDE. Background.? Population-based cross-sectional studies have consistently reported an association between migraine and depression. However, longitudinal studies about this potentially bidirectional association are inconsistent. Methods.? This retrospective cohort study used 12 years of follow-up data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (15,254 respondents, age >12). Stratified analysis, logistic regression, and proportional hazard modeling were used to quantify the effect of migraine on subsequent MDE status and vice versa. Results.? After adjusting for sex, age, and other chronic health conditions, respondents with migraine were 60% more likely (HR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.9) to develop MDE compared with those without migraine. Similarly adjusting for sex and age, respondents with MDE were 40% more likely (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.9) to develop migraine compared with those without MDE. However, the latter association disappeared after adjustment for stress and childhood trauma. Conclusions.? The current study provides substantial evidence that migraine is associated with the later development of MDEs, but does not provide strong causal evidence of an association in the other direction. Environmental factors such as childhood trauma and stress may shape the expression of this bidirectional relationship; however, the precise underlying mechanisms are not yet known.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength due to excessive loss of bone protein and mineral content. The imbalance between osteogenesis by osteoblasts and osteoclastogenesis by osteoclasts contributes to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Estrogen withdrawal leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Overactivated osteoclasts by inflammation play a vital role in the imbalance. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus with various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Here we demonstrate that matrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vivo with decreased serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-α, and IL-6. In vitro matrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator for NF-?B ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF in bone marrow monocytes and RAW264.7 cells as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption through pit formation assays. For molecular mechanisms, matrine abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-?B, AKT, and MAPK pathways and suppressed osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, TRAP, C-Src, and cathepsin K. Our study demonstrates that matrine inhibits osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and that matrine is a promising agent in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases such as osteoporosis.?Chen, X., Zhi, X., Pan, P., Cui, J., Cao, L., Weng, W., Zhou, Q., Wang, L., Zhai, X.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - ABSTRACT Few pooled analyses of antiresorptive (AR) treatment trials relate short-term changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs) to subsequent fracture reduction. Such information would be useful to assess new ARs or novel dosing regimens. In the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Bone Quality project, we analyzed individual-level data from 28,000 participants enrolled in 11 bisphosphonate (BP) and three selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) placebo-controlled fracture endpoint trials. Using BTM results for two bone formation markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [bone ALP] and pro-collagen I N-propeptide [PINP]) and two bone resorption markers (N-terminal and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) and incident fracture outcome data, we performed a meta-regression relating the mean net effect of treatment on change in bone turnover (active minus placebo % difference after 3 to 12 months) to the log of study-wide fracture risk reduction, and used linear regression to plot the best fitting line. Separate analyses were performed for incident morphometric vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures over 1 to 4 years of follow-up. Change in bone ALP and PINP were available for over 16,000 and 10,000 participants, respectively. For vertebral fracture, the results showed a strong relationship between treatment-related bone ALP or PINP changes and vertebral fracture risk reduction (r2?=?0.82 [p?<?0.001] and r2?=?0.75 [p?=?0.011], respectively) Relationships were weaker and no longer statistically significant for nonvertebral (r2?=?0.33 [p?=?0.053] and r2?=?0.53 [p?=?0.065], respectively) and hip fracture (r2?=?0.17 [p?=?0.24] and r2?=?0.43 [p?=?0.11], respectively) outcomes. Analyses limited to BP trials gave similar results. For all fracture types, relationships were weaker and nonsignificant for bone resorption markers. We conclude that short-term AR treatment-related changes in bone ALP and PINP strongly predict vertebral fracture treatment efficacy, but not nonvertebral or hip fracture treatment efficacy. Change in bone formation markers might be useful to predict the anti-vertebral fracture efficacy of new AR compounds or novel dosing regiments with approved AR drugs. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary For a continuous treatment, the generalised propensity score (GPS) is defined as the conditional density of the treatment, given covariates. GPS adjustment may be implemented by including it as a covariate in an outcome regression. Here, the unbiased estimation of the dose?response function assumes correct specification of both the GPS and the outcome-treatment relationship. This paper introduces a machine learning method, the ?Super Learner?, to address model selection in this context. In the two-stage estimation approach proposed, the Super Learner selects a GPS and then a dose?response function conditional on the GPS, as the convex combination of candidate prediction algorithms. We compare this approach with parametric implementations of the GPS and to regression methods. We contrast the methods in the Risk Adjustment in Neurocritical care cohort study, in which we estimate the marginal effects of increasing transfer time from emergency departments to specialised neuroscience centres, for patients with acute traumatic brain injury. With parametric models for the outcome, we find that dose?response curves differ according to choice of specification. With the Super Learner approach to both regression and the GPS, we find that transfer time does not have a statistically significant marginal effect on the outcomes. ? 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Aim To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the interleukin-1 gene cluster (IL1) are associated with the occurrence and severity of inflammatory external root resorption (IERR) after replantation of avulsed permanent teeth. Methodology Indexes of IERR were radiographically assessed in 182 mature replanted permanent teeth from 146 patients at the onset of endodontic therapy. DNA was extracted from buccal mucosa cells and genotyped using TaqMan probes-based assays for the SNPs IL1A -889C/T (rs 180058), IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598). Teeth were grouped into two categories: IERR absent to mild (indexes ≤4) and moderate to severe IERR (indexes >4). Genetic variations in the IL1 gene cluster were tested for their effect on the occurrence and extension of IERR using the GEE model (generalized estimation equation). Patient's age at the moment of injury, timing of pulpectomy, extra-alveolar period and storage condition of the avulsed teeth was included as possible confounders. Results No association was found between SNPs IL1A -889C/T, IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598) and IERR indexes. Timing of pulpectomy (OR 3.5 IC 95% 2.0?6.2 P < 0.001) and patient's age at the moment of trauma (OR 0.29 IC 95% 0.12?0.67 P = 0.004) significantly affected the risk of developing severe IERR. Conclusions While timing of pulpectomy and patient's age at the moment of trauma were confirmed as important risk factors, SNPs within the IL1 gene cluster did not affect the susceptibility for IERR after replantation of permanent teeth.

AB  - Abstract Implant-related infections are often devastating situations in orthopaedic trauma surgery particularly if multiresistant bacteria are involved. Protection of the implant surface by an antimicrobial coating exhibiting activity against multiresistant bacterial strains is of high interest. Aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of an Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating for fracture fixation devices, such as nails, plates, and external fixators, including tests against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its biocompatibility. The antimicrobial activity of the coating deposited onto 12 ? 3 mm2 stainless steel implants was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and MRSA using different testing methods (ASTM E-2810, JIS Z 2801, proliferation assay). Additionally, the coated devices were implanted into the paravertebral muscle of rabbits and explanted after 2, 7, 14, and 28 days to test the remaining ex vivo antimicrobial activity. For biocompatibility assessment the Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating was tested in vitro according to ISO 10993-5. The Ag/SiOxCy coating exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against all tested bacterial strains in all three in vitro tests. Ex vivo testing proved suppression of more than 99.9 % of bacterial proliferation by the coating compared to non-coated samples even after 28 days. ISO 10993-5 showed good biocompatibility of the coating without any indications of cytotoxic effects. In summary, Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating showed excellent antimicrobial activity including effectiveness against MRSA and good in vitro biocompatibility. Therefore, it possesses high potential as a prophylactic agent in orthopaedic trauma surgery. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2010.

AB  - Objectives To determine the underlying disease prevalence in acute feline dyspnoea and to examine whether historical and clinical examination findings can differentiate between acute cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea in cats in primary practice. Materials and Methods We prospectively enrolled cats presenting with dyspnoea for the first time to primary practice between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2016. We collected signalment, historical and clinical data at presentation using a standard form. Cases were investigated by primary clinicians, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the authors. Records lacking critical data were excluded. Relationships between historical or clinical variables and dyspnoea aetiology were examined. Diagnostic test performance analyses were used to find optimal cut-off values for select historical or clinical variables that could differentiate cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea. Results Participants included 108 cats. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 92 cases; 60 were cardiac (65%), 15 respiratory (16%), 10 neoplastic (11%) and 7 traumatic (8%). Of cats with cardiac dyspnoea, 25% had a history of cough. A gallop sound, rectal temperature less than 37·5°C, heart rate of greater than 200?bpm and respiratory rate greater than 80 per minute were all useful to predict cardiac-associated dyspnoea. A triage algorithm using these findings in combination was designed to optimise the rapid diagnosis of probable cardiac dyspnoea. Clinical Significance Dyspnoeic cats presenting in practice with hypothermia, tachycardia, gallop sounds or profound tachypnoea are likely to have a cardiac cause underlying their dyspnoea. Although diagnosis requires confirmation, clinicians may be able to stratify risk and prioritise further investigation based on these findings.

AB  - Abstract This study presents the excavation and multidisciplinary analysis of seven skeletons recovered in a World War I Mass Grave on the mountains of the Veneto Region, Italy. While it is not a rare phenomenon to these mountainous areas involved in the First Conflict, it is exceptional, on these mountains, to find a mass grave with soldiers in primary burials. Stratigraphic excavation was the mean used for recovery, along with 3D laser scanning documentation. Every skeleton but one was found complete and in anatomical connection. Four soldiers lay in the prone position; two subjects were lying on their side. Identification of the nationality was performed for two of the subjects, who both of whom had personal effects such as a badge for military vaccinations and religious medals. What remained of their uniforms gave clues about their Italian nationality. The entomological analysis conducted on fly puparia discovered close to the bones revealed that the bodies had not been buried immediately. The skeletons were biologically profiled by sex, age, height and ancestry. An accurate study of pathology and stress markers was carried on, as well as on skeletal trauma in order to establish the type of trauma and ammunition involved. The remains belonged altogether to seven Italian male soldiers ages between 18 and 35. Various kinds of stress markers revealed occupational (enthesopathies) and metabolic stress: several signs of cribra cranii and of cribra orbitalia were registered. The study of the injuries revealed a surprising variety of types of lesions, mostly lethal: a few subjects were struck by a shrapnel grenade; one soldier was killed by a grenade explosion. Two of the soldiers were probably executed, instead: this conclusion reached on the basis of gunshot holes (9 mm) in their skulls, and by the position of the injuries.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in damage to the developing brain, particularly in severely injured individuals. Little is known, however, of the long-term structural aspects of the brain following childhood TBI. This study investigated the integrity of the brain 10 years post-TBI using magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics in a sample of 49 participants with mild, moderate and severe TBI, evaluated against a normative sample of 20 individuals from a pediatric database with comparable age and gender distribution. Structural integrity was investigated in gray and white matter, and by manually segmenting two regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala), potentially vulnerable to the effects of childhood TBI. The results indicate that more severe injuries caused a reduction in gray and white brain matter, while all TBI severity levels resulted in increased volumes of cerebrospinal fluid and smaller hippocampal volumes. In addition, enlarged amygdala volumes were detected in severely injured patients compared to their mild and moderate counterparts, suggesting that childhood TBI may disrupt the development of certain brain regions through diffuse pathological changes. The findings highlight the lasting impact of childhood TBI on the brain and the importance of monitoring brain structure in the long-term after early injury.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Opioids are an important component of multi-modal analgesia techniques. Different classes of analgesic drugs, when used concurrently, will modulate the pain pathway at different anatomical sites and receptor and transmitter systems, thereby providing more effective analgesia than a single class of drug alone. With few exceptions, combing different classes of analgesic drugs is not associated with increased risk of side effects, making multi-modal analgesia a safe and effective strategy to improve pain relief.

AB  - Abstract Two cases of ruptured non-traumatic aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta and a third in which rupture was imminent are discussed with regard to two simple operative techniques, both of which were employed with success. Partial aneurysmectomy was employed in one case and a temporary to permanent shunt graft in the other two. The simplicity of the techniques is such that they may be used in hospitals which are not equipped for extracorporeal perfusion.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the psychological effects of violence and disaster in both adults and children, although much remains to be understood. Siblings of children who have undergone such experiences have been little studied. Such siblings may be bereaved or may experience changes in family circumstances, or may develop psychological sequelae. They may be affected by legal procedures and media coverage. This new understanding of the needs of siblings may have implications for service development, including health and education.

AB  - Damage to the central nervous system triggers rapid activation and specific migration of glial cells towards the lesion site. There, glial cells contribute heavily to secondary neuronal changes that take place after lesion. In an attempt to identify the molecular cues of glial activation following brain trauma we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screenings from lesioned and control hippocampus. Here we report on the identification of the macrophage/microglia activation factor (MAF), a new membrane protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Expression analysis revealed that MAF is predominantly expressed in microglial cells in the brain, and is upregulated following brain lesion. Overexpression of MAF in non-glial cells shows an intracellular codistribution with the lysosomal marker endosome/lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1). Furthermore, MAF-transfected cells show that MAF is primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and that this association can be disrupted by activation of protein kinase C-dependent pathways. In conclusion, these results imply that MAF is involved in the dynamics of lysosomal membranes associated with microglial activation following brain lesion.
