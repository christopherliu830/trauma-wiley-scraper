AB  - Abstract Tendon injuries are common musculoskeletal system disorders in clinical, but the regeneration ability of tendon is limited. Tendon stem cells (TSCs) have shown promising effect on tissue engineering and been used for the treatment of tendon injury. Exosomes that serve as genetic information carriers have been implicated in many diseases and physiological processes, but effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury repair is unclear. The aim of this study is to make clear that the effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury healing. Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5 weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3. Exosomes from TSCs could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing for its balancing tendon extracellular matrix and promoting the tenogenesis of TSCs.

AB  - Abstract An exponential increase in the prevalence of neurological disorders requires substantial steps to be taken for their prevention and treatment. Neurodiagnostic biomarkers are gaining momentum presently in order to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenerative disorders, to precisely assess their advancement and to monitor the efficiency of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the primary focus of the present review is the recent development in this field of neurodiagnostic biomarkers, and the current state of biomarker exploration in the context of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses an updated and detailed account of specific (?-Amyloid, Tau and Phospho-tau 181, Tar-DNA binding protein-43, Progranulin, a-synuclein, Clusterin, etc) and non-specific (genetic, synaptic, inflammatory and coagulation) neurodiagnostic biomarkers and the recent advances in this growing field. This comprehensive review also suggests the utilization of neurodiagnostic markers in network approaches and personalized medication that will eventually improvise the existing diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of neurodiagnostic biomarkers.

AB  - Summary Sleep disturbance is commonly reported by participants with post-traumatic stress disorder, but objective evidence of poor sleep is often absent. Here we compared self-report and actigraphic evaluations of sleep between veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and controls. Participants reported their sleep retrospectively for the month before the recording night and on the recording night. On the recording night, they wore an Actiwatch-64 and were instructed to press the marker button upon getting into bed, each time they awoke, and at their final awakening. The post-traumatic stress disorder group reported much worse sleep than controls on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for the previous month and somewhat poorer sleep on the recording night. However, on the recording night, neither diary nor actigraphic measures of number of awakenings, total time in bed, nor time lying awake after sleep onset differed between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder. Diary-reported number of awakenings was fewer than actigraphically captured awakenings. These results suggest a memory bias towards remembering worse sleep on the nights before the recording night.

AB  - Abstract The feet of apes have a different morphology from those of humans. Until now, it has merely been assumed that the morphology seen in humans must be adaptive for habitual bipedal walking, as the habitual use of bipedal walking is generally regarded as one of the most clear-cut differences between humans and apes. This study asks simply whether human skeletal proportions do actually enhance foot performance during human-like bipedalism, by examining the influence of foot proportions on force, torque and work in the foot joints during simulated bipedal walking. Skeletons of the common chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla and human were represented by multi-rigid-body models, where the components of the foot make external contact via finite element surfaces. The models were driven by identical joint motion functions collected from experiments on human walking. Simulated contact forces between the ground and the foot were found to be reasonably comparable with measurements made during human walking using pressure- and force-platforms. Joint force, torque and work in the foot were then predicted. Within the limitations of our model, the results show that during simulated human-like bipedal walking, (1) the human and non-human ape (NHA) feet carry similar joint forces, although the distributions of the forces differ; (2) the NHA foot incurs larger joint torques than does the human foot, although the human foot has higher values in the first tarso-metatarsal and metatarso-phalangeal joints, whereas the NHA foot incurs higher values in the lateral digits; and (3) total work in the metatarso-phalangeal joints is lower in the human foot than in the NHA foot. The results indicate that human foot proportions are indeed well suited to performance in normal human walking.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective:? To examine the cost of care for laparoscopic versus open surgery and the added cost of nosocomial infections for three common surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. Methods:? The Cardinal Health database repository was utilized to extract reimbursement data for laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy surgical procedures. Utilizing a 22-hospital sample and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant clinical data extraction technique, the Cardinal Health database repository produced a Nosocomial Infection Marker to identify and track nosocomial infection rates for these procedures. ICD-9 codes were utilized to identify 10,731 patients who had undergone these procedures between September 2004 and December 2006. Multivariable linear regression models were estimated to isolate the effects of laparoscopic versus open surgery and nosocomial infections on the cost of care. Results:? Laparoscopic surgery significantly reduces the overall cost of care for cholecystectomies, hysterectomies, and appendectomies. Controlling for the cost of nosocomial infection, incremental cost savings from laparoscopic versus open surgery for all three procedures average $1608. Cholecystectomy has the largest savings ($3299), followed by hysterectomy ($1385) and appendectomy ($1032). These cost savings in part reflect that patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures have shorter lengths of stay. In contrast, nosocomial infection increases costs substantially for each surgery type, raising costs for cholecystectomy by $4794, hysterectomy by $4528, and appendectomy by $6108. Conclusion:? The cost of care for laparoscopic surgery is lower than open surgery for cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. This conclusion is based on actual hospital reimbursement data.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has a number of indications in paediatric musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, and provides many advantages over traditional imaging and diagnostic techniques. This chapter attention focusses on PoCUS and its application to more acute presentations, including infectious, inflammatory and traumatic conditions. In terms of examiner technique, adequate ultrasound gel, appropriate probe manipulation, probe stabilisation using the hypothenar eminence and little finger of the examiner's hand, as well as multi-angle views to evaluate for anisotropy, are all important to obtaining high-quality clinically useful ultrasound images. PoCUS can be useful in the diagnosis, evaluation and also often the treatment of paediatric skin and soft-tissue infections. Common entities evaluated are cellulitis, abscess and acute haematogenous osteomyelitis. Retained foreign bodies (FBs), dislocation/subluxation in children, ligament, tendon injuries, and joint effusions are also discussed. A high-frequency (7-12?MHz) probe with paediatric hip/MSK preset should be used if available.

AB  - Liver transplantation (LT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has been associated with a high rate of ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBSs) and inferior graft survival. To investigate the impact of an intraoperative tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on outcomes following DCD LT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of DCD LT at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and the Ochsner Medical Center (OMC). Between 2009 and 2013, 85 DCD LTs were performed with an intraoperative tPA injection (n?=?30 at TGH, n?=?55 at OMC), and they were compared with 33 DCD LTs without a tPA. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion requirement (3.2?±?3.4 versus 3.1?±?2.3 U, P?=?0.74). Overall, biliary strictures occurred less commonly in the tPA-treated group (16.5% versus 33.3%, P?=?0.07) with a much lower rate of diffuse intrahepatic strictures (3.5% versus 21.2%, P?=?0.005). After 1 and 3 years, the tPA group versus the non-tPA group had superior patient survival (97.6% versus 87.0% and 92.7% versus 79.7%, P?=?0.016) and graft survival (96.4% versus 69.7% and 90.2% versus 63.6%, P?<?0.001). In conclusion, a tPA injection into the hepatic artery during DCD LT reduces ITBSs and improves graft and patient survival without increasing the risk for bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Several focal skeletal muscle diseases, including tumours and trauma lead to a limited loss of functional muscle tissue. There is still no suitable clinical approach for treating such defects. A promising approach could be the tissue engineering of skeletal muscle. However, a clinically reliable differentiation stimulus for three-dimensional (3-D) cultures is necessary for this process, and this condition has not yet been established. In order to qunantify and analyze the differentiation potential of electrical cell stimulation, primary myoblasts were stimulated within a 3-D fibrin-matrix. Gene expression of MyoD, myogenin and AChR were measured by real-time RT-PCR over a time period of eight days, showing immediate down-regulation of all marker genes. For tissue engineering approaches, cell multiplication is crucial for acquisition of sufficient tissue volumes for reconstruction. Therefore, all experiments were performed with high and low passaged myoblasts, demonstrating higher transcript rates of marker genes in lowpassage cells. Our findings strongly suggest a reconsideration of electrical stimulation in muscle tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Objectives We tested the hypothesis that the purported unstable climate in the South Urals region during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA) resulted in health instability and social stress as evidenced by skeletal response. Methods The skeletal sample (n?=?99) derived from Kamennyi Ambar 5 (KA-5), a MBA kurgan cemetery (2040-1730 cal. BCE, 2 sigma) associated with the Sintashta culture. Skeletal stress indicators assessed included cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and tibia periosteal new bone growth. Dental disease (caries, abscess, calculus, and periodontitis) and trauma were scored. Results were compared to regional data from the nearby Samara Valley, spanning the Early to Late Bronze Age (EBA, LBA). Results Lesions were minimal for the KA-5 and MBA-LBA groups except for periodontitis and dental calculus. No unambiguous weapon injuries or injuries associated with violence were observed for the KA-5 group; few injuries occurred at other sites. Subadults (<18 years) formed the majority of each sample. At KA-5, subadults accounted for 75% of the sample with 10% (n?=?10) estimated to be 14-18 years of age. Conclusions Skeletal stress markers and injuries were uncommon among the KA-5 and regional groups, but a MBA-LBA high subadult mortality indicates elevated frailty levels and inability to survive acute illnesses. Following an optimal weaning program, subadults were at risk for physiological insult and many succumbed. Only a small number of individuals attained biological maturity during the MBA, suggesting that a fast life history was an adaptive regional response to a less hospitable and perhaps unstable environment.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic splenectomy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term impairment of humoral and cellular immunity. Alternatives to surgery have been developed to minimize or avoid the immediate and/or long-term complications of splenectomy. Herein we investigated the long-term effect of non-operative management (NOM) of the traumatic rupture of the spleen on the distribution of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte populations and cytokine production by T cells. PB samples were drawn from six NOM patients, 13 age-matched adults who had undergone splenectomy after trauma (SP patients) and 31 age-matched controls. Cellular phenotypes and the intracellular production of interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in T cells were determined in whole blood?±?mitogens by flow cytometry. NOM patients did not show any changes in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the distribution of their subsets, compared to the controls. In contrast, SP patients showed a sustained increase in the percentage and/or absolute numbers of lymphocytes, CD8 T cells, activated CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK)?T cells, NK cells and ?δ T cells, and a reduction in naive CD4 T cells. The constitutive or induced cytokine production by T cells of the NOM group was similar to the control group, whereas SP patients had increased percentages of constitutive IL-2- and IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells and IFN-?-producing CD4 T cells. Our findings indicate collectively that the healing process in NOM does not affect the architecture of the spleen to such an extent that it would lead to long-term alterations of the proportions of PB lymphocytes or the T cell cytokine profiles.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

Transcriptional and non-transcriptional Pax7 functions in myogenic progenitors ?? Protein interactions, post-translational modifications and the regulation of Pax7 ?? Extracellular signalling and the control of Pax7 in muscle progenitors -? Wnt signalling -? Notch signalling -? The transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) superfamily -? Syndecans -? Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and p38 ?? Concluding remarks Post-natal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle is highly dependent on a population of resident myogenic precursors known as satellite cells. Transcription factors from the Pax gene family, Pax3 and Pax7, are critical for satellite cell biogenesis, survival and potentially self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. This is particularly true in the case of Pax7, which appears to regulate myogenesis at multiple levels. Accordingly, recent data have highlighted the importance of a functional relationship between Pax7 and the MyoD family of muscle regulatory transcription factors during normal muscle formation and disease. Here we will critically review key findings suggesting that Pax7 may play a dual role by promoting resident muscle progenitors to commit to the skeletal muscle lineage while preventing terminal differentiation, thus keeping muscle progenitors poised to differentiate upon environmental cues. In addition, potential regulatory mechanisms for the control of Pax7 activity will be proposed.

AB  - Translations of summary The author presents a case study of a hemophiliac boy in four-times-a-week analysis from the age of four to six and a half years. An extensive narrative of various phases of the analysis including the termination provides the reader access to the material for discussion of therapeutic action. Her analytic technique is based on a developmental point of view and illustrates the use of limits, play, and interpretation based on countertransference. She understands the boy's symptoms of preferring to be a girl, asking to cut his penis off, and wishing to die as defenses against the fear of castration, which in his case is aggravated by the actual threat of repeated medical interventions, and by the underlying fear of a lack of body composition. An unusual feature of the case is the illustration of the symptom, the analysis, and the recovery of the male self, captured in a complex collage that was made over the course of the relatively short analysis.
