AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - The present study describes method for autologous bone transplantation to an area of nonunion at the pelvic ring in a way that ensures the best possible bone-to-bone interface (?press-fit?) and provides optimal preconditions for the ingrowth of the bone graft. We modified a technique that has been used to transplant press-fit bone-baseplate-cartilage cylinders for the repair of joint cartilage defects. The technique allows for precise harvesting of bone cylinders with a diamond-coated and fluid-cooled instrument. At the site where the graft shall be inserted, a cylindrical hole is created with a corresponding hollow diamond-coated trephine. This ensures an optimal press-fit implantation of the graft. The new surgical technique has been applied in four patients with nonunion of the pelvic ring. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. In three patients, the procedure led to a reduction of pain and a higher level of mobility as well as a timely radiographic union (imaging not available for another patient). Our technique offers a valuable new treatment option for pelvic nonunion. The current article serves as a proof of concept. Future comparative studies will have to determine its value in detail.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?±?9 and 44?±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by a local Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Uppsala, Sweden), with written consent from the horse owners. Sources of funding:?none. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Osteosarcomas (OS) are the most common malignant bone tumors, and the identification of useful tumor biomarkers and target proteins is required to predict the clinical outcome of patients and therapeutic response as well as to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In our previous study, MAPK7 has been identified as a candidate oncogene, and a promising prognostic marker for OS. Sequential activation of protein kinases within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades is a common mechanism of signal transduction in many cellular processes. In this study, we investigated the behavior of MAPK7 gene in OS cell lines. Technical viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were used to evaluate the function of the MAPK7 gene. We evaluated the behavior of the OS cells with MAPK7 gene silenced, not silenced, and exposed to the main chemotherapy drugs used in OS treatment. We found that silenced MAPK7 gene is effective at suppressing cell proliferation, inhibiting cell migration, and invasion. Furthermore, MAPK7 is an important activator of transcription factors and is the main expression modulator of other key genes in the MAPK pathway. In summary, our study suggests that MAPK7 might be a promising therapeutic target for OS. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should include derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Skin trauma in horses often leads to the development of chronic nonhealing wounds that lack a keratinocyte cover, vital for healing. Reports in mouse and man confirm the possibility of generating functional keratinocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), thus presenting myriad potential applications for wound management or treatment of skin disease. Similarly, differentiation of equine iPSC (eiPSC) into a keratinocyte lineage should provide opportunities for the advancement of veterinary regenerative medicine. Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient method for the differentiation of eiPSC into a keratinocyte lineage. It was hypothesised that eiPSC can form differentiated keratinocytes (eiPSC-KC) comparable with primary equine keratinocytes (PEK) in their morphological and functional characteristics. Study design Experimental in vitro study. Methods Equine iPSC established using a nonviral system were treated for 30 days with retinoic acid and bone morphogenetic protein-4 to induce directed differentiation into iPSC-KC. Temporospatial gene and protein expression by eiPSC-KC was measured at weekly intervals of differentiation and in response to calcium switch. Proliferative and migratory capacities of eiPSC-KC were compared with those of PEK. Results Equine iPSC, upon directed differentiation, showed loss of pluripotency genes and progressive increase in pancytokeratin expression indicating ectodermal specification into keratinocytes. High differentiation efficiency was achieved, with 82.5% of eiPSC expressing keratin 14, a marker of epidermal-specific basal stem cells, after 30 days of directed differentiation. Moreover, the proliferative capacity of eiPSC-KC was superior, while the migratory capacity (measured as the ability to epithelise in vitro wounds) was comparable with that of PEK. Conclusions This proof of concept study suggests that eiPSC can successfully be differentiated into equine keratinocytes (eiPSC-KC) with features that are promising to the development of a stem cell-based skin construct, with the potential to regenerate lost or damaged skin.

AB  - Abstract We measured ERPs of professional boxers in a Go/No-Go task, comparing them to fencers and non-athletes. Results showed that fencing improved attention and motor response control, but boxing did not. More strikingly, in boxers, as in brain trauma patients, the P3 component was delayed and reduced. The P3 delay of boxers was correlated with the amount of performed sport exercise. Furthermore, in terms of behavior, boxers showed increased intra-individual variability and switch cost. Results were consistent with the hypothesis of specific impairment at the level of response inhibition processing. We suggest that this impairment is derived from the cumulative effect of blows to the head. The changes found in boxers suggest that ERPs and reaction times may be a tool for early detection of specific brain dysfunction.

AB  - The voltage-gated ?glial? sodium channel NaG belongs to a distinct molecular class within the multi-gene family of mammalian sodium channels. Originally found in central and peripheral glia, NaG has since been detected in neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and may play a role in Schwann cell-axon interactions. We have studied the presence of NaG-like immunoreactivity in the intact and injured human peripheral nervous system using a specific affinity-purified antibody. Nerve fibres in normal and injured peripheral nerves and normal skin exhibited intense NaG-immunoreactivity. Numerous NaG-immunoreactive nerve fibres surrounded neuronal cell bodies within postmortem control DRG, and in DRG avulsed from the spinal cord (i.e. after traumatic central axotomy). There were no significant differences in the pattern of NaG immunostaining between control and avulsed DRG, or with delay after injury. Generally, the neuronal cell bodies were only very weakly immunoreactive to NaG, indicating that the NaG immunoreactivity was predominantly in Schwann cells/myelin. In accord, we demonstrated NaG immunostaining in cultured human and rat Schwann cells, and in distal nerve after wallerian degeneration. NaG thus appears to be a useful new marker for Schwann cells in the human PNS, and a role in neuropathy deserves investigation.

AB  - Proteomics and systems biology have significantly contributed to biomarker discovery in the field of brain injury. This study utilized 2D-DIGE-PMF-MS as a preliminary screen to detect biomarkers in a rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). Brain-specific systems biology analysis of brain tissue identified 386 proteins having a fold change of more than 2, of which 321 proteins were increased and 65 were decreased 24 h after PBBI compared to sham controls. The majority of upregulated proteins were cytoskeletal (10.5%), nucleic acid binding (9.3%), or kinases (8.9%). Most proteins were involved in protein metabolism (22.7%), signal transduction (20.4%), and development (9.6%). Pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were involved in neurite outgrowth and cell differentiation. Semiquantitative Western blotting of 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after PBBI indicated ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (a proposed traumatic brain injury biomarker in human clinical trials), tyrosine hydroxylase, and syntaxin-6 were found to be consistently elevated in brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid after PBBI compared to sham controls. Combining proteomics and brain-specific systems biology can define underlying mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and provide valuable information in biomarker discovery that, in turn, may lead to novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Disentangling the putative impact of cannabis on brain morphology from other comorbid substance use is critical. After controlling for the effects of nicotine, alcohol and multi-substance use, this study aimed to determine whether frequent cannabis use is associated with significantly smaller subcortical grey matter volumes. Design Exploratory analyses using mixed linear models, one per region of interest (ROI), were performed whereby individual differences in volume (outcome) at seven subcortical ROIs were regressed onto cannabis and comorbid substance use (predictors). Setting Two large population-based twin samples from the United States and Australia. Participants A total of 622 young Australian adults [66% female; ?age = 25.9, standard deviation SD) = 3.6] and 474 middle-aged US males (?age = 56.1SD = 2.6) of predominately Anglo-Saxon ancestry with complete substance use and imaging data. Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury were excluded. Measurements Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and volumetric segmentation methods were used to estimate volume in seven subcortical ROIs: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Substance use measurements included maximum nicotine and alcohol use, total life-time multi-substance use, maximum cannabis use in the young adults and regular cannabis use in the middle-aged males. Findings After correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.007), cannabis use was unrelated to any subcortical ROI. However, maximum nicotine use was associated with significantly smaller thalamus volumes in middle-aged males. Conclusions In exploratory analyses based on young adult and middle-aged samples, normal variation in cannabis use is unrelated statistically to individual differences in brain morphology as measured by subcortical volume.
