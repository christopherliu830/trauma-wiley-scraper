AB  - Abstract A case of complex microsurgical reconstruction of the dorsum of the foot, including tendon transfer following tumor resection, in a 15-week-old male infant is presented. After birth, a 5.5 ? 4 cm large tumor was observed on the dorsum of the right foot. Biopsy showed a congenital malignant fibro sarcoma. After initial chemotherapy a radical excision of the tumor at the age of 14 weeks was followed. To cover the defect a musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap was taken, the cutaneous part being large enough to cover the defect. Extensor tendons were reconstructed with free tendon transplants. Amputation is usually indicated in these cases. To the best of our knowledge, microsurgical reconstruction in infants at this age with congenital malignant tumors has not yet been reported. The case shows that Plastic surgery can play an important role in pediatric oncology and should routinely be integrated into the multi-modal treatment concepts. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent an ideal source of autologous cell-based therapy for chronic wounds. Functional characteristics of MSCs may benefit wound healing by exerting their multi-regenerative potential. However, cell ageing resulting from chronic degenerative diseases or donor age could cause inevitable effects on the regenerative abilities of MSCs. A variety of studies have shown the relationship between MSC ageing and age-related dysfunction, but few associate these age-related impacts on MSCs with their ability of repairing chronic wounds, which are common in the elderly population. Here, we discuss the age-associated changes of MSCs and describe the potential impacts on MSC-based therapy for chronic wounds. Furthermore, critical evaluation of the current literatures is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms of MSC ageing and raising the corresponding concerns on considering their possible use for chronic wound repair.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Abstract Background A descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the characteristics of workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China can contribute to a scientific basis for the prevention and control of such fatal incidents as well for as the facilitation of medical assistance during these episodes. Methods We used data on workplace-based multiple fatality incidents spanning January 1, 2001?December 31, 2008 as collected by the National Work Safety Administration of China to analyze event frequency, type, number of deaths, mortality rate (per million persons), and regional distribution. Results A total of 17,277 workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were reported between 2001 and 2008, which were associated with 62,850 deaths and 30,418 injuries. The most common types or settings associated with workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were road traffic accidents (>3 deaths only; total 23,464 deaths), coal mine explosions (23,418 deaths), and incidents involving shipping (3,978 deaths). Conclusion The risk for workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China is one of the highest in the world. Prevention is critical and should be strengthened. Our results may provide useful information help to improve prevention and control measures. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54:560?564, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most lethal primary brain tumours. Increasing evidence shows that brain tumours contain the population of stem cells, so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Stem cell marker CD133 was reported to identify CSC population in GBM. Further studies have indicated that CD133 negative cells exhibiting similar properties and are able to initiate the tumour, self-renew and undergo multilineage differentiation. GBM is a highly heterogeneous tumour and may contain different stem cell populations with different functional properties. We characterized five GBM cell lines, established from surgical samples, according to the marker expression, proliferation and differentiation potential. CD133 positive cell lines showed increased proliferation rate in neurosphere condition and marked differentiation potential towards neuronal lineages. Whereas two cell lines low-expressing CD133 marker showed mesenchymal properties in vitro, that is high proliferation rate in serum condition and differentiation in mesenchymal cell types. Further, we compared therapy resistance capacity of GBM cell lines treated with hydroxyurea. Our results suggest that CSC concept is more complex than it was believed before, and CD133 could not define entire stem cell population within GBM. At least two different subtypes of GBM CSCs exist, which may have different biological characteristics and imply different therapeutic strategies. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern with implications for animal health. This study investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal and environmental Escherichia coli isolated from animals sampled in referral hospitals in the UK. Materials and Methods Resistant Escherichia coli isolated from animal faeces and practice environments were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing techniques were used to identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC-producer genotypes. Results In total, 333 faecal and 257 environmental samples were collected. Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli were found in 13·1% of faecal and 8·9% of environmental samples. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC genes were identified 14% and 7·7% of faecal samples and 8·6% and 8·6% of environmental samples, respectively. The most common extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene type detected was blaCTX-M ?15, although blaTEM-158 was detected in faecal and environmental samples from one practice. Clinical Significance Escherichia coli resistant to key antimicrobials were isolated from hospitalised animals and the practice environment. We identified the emergence of the inhibitor resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaTEM-158 in companion animals. Further investigation to determine risk factors for colonisation with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is needed to provide evidence for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes.

AB  - Acute bacterial infection of the central nervous system requires rapid and adequate management. Etiological diagnosis is hence crucial. Moreover, the epidemic threat of certain bacteria necessitates a reliable characterization of the involved bacterial strains to follow the spread of epidemic strains. Conventional identification and characterization of etiological agents are basically based on culture and identification of bacterial markers most frequently by serological assays. Molecular identification and characterization of bacteria have been employed. They provide more reliable analysis of bacterial isolates. Molecular methods for non-culture diagnosis of bacterial infections have recently been developed. In many cases, the molecular assays have decreased the identification time of positive cultures and rescued detection of pathogens in culture-negative clinical samples.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal imaging has advanced leaps and bounds from the time Roentgen utilized X-rays to obtain a plain radiograph in 1895. This chapter outlines the modalities commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging, including plain radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (US). It discusses the applications of the above modalities in the diagnosis and management of traumatic injuries, infection, arthritis, and tumors. Plain radiography is a two-dimensional depiction of three-dimensional structures and as such, evaluation of complex areas such as the foot, pelvis, and spine can be suboptimal. CT is also useful for assessment of nontraumatic pathologies like arthritis. MRI is one of the more commonly used imaging modalities in musculoskeletal imaging. US is also useful in dynamic assessment of tendons, ligaments, and joints. Imaging plays a vital role in assessment of musculoskeletal trauma. Musculoskeletal tumors comprise benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

AB  - Abstract Objective The present study aimed to describe and examine similarities and differences in the current service provision and resuscitation protocols of the ambulance services participating in the Aus-ROC Australian and New Zealand out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Epistry. Understanding these similarities and differences is important in identifying ambulance service factors that might explain regional variation in survival of OHCA in the Aus-ROC Epistry. Methods A structured questionnaire was completed by each of the ambulance services participating in the Aus-ROC Epistry. These ambulance services were SA Ambulance Service, Ambulance Victoria, St John Ambulance Western Australia, Queensland Ambulance Service, St John Ambulance NT, St John New Zealand and Wellington Free Ambulance. The survey aimed to describe ambulance service and dispatch characteristics, resuscitation protocols and details of cardiac arrest registries. Results We observed similarities between services with respect to the treatment of OHCA and dispatch systems. Differences between services were observed in the serviced population; the proportion of paramedics with basic life support, advanced life support or intensive care training skills; the number of OHCA cases attended; guidelines related to withholding or terminating resuscitation attempts; and the variables that might be used to define ?attempted resuscitation?. All seven participating ambulance services were noted to have existing OHCA registries. Conclusion There is marked variation between ambulance services currently participating in the Aus-ROC Australian and New Zealand OHCA Epistry with respect to workforce characteristics and key variable definitions. This variation between ambulance services might account for a proportion of the regional variation in survival of OHCA.

AB  - Many computer assisted surgery systems are based on intraoperative x-ray images. To achieve reliable and accurate results these images have to be calibrated concerning geometric distortions, which can be distinguished between constant distortions and distortions caused by magnetic fields. Instead of using an intraoperative calibration phantom that has to be visible within each image resulting in overlaying markers, the presented approach directly takes advantage of the physical background of the distortions. Based on a computed physical model of an image intensifier and a magnetic field sensor, an online compensation of distortions can be achieved without the need of an intraoperative calibration phantom. The model has to be adapted once to each specific image intensifier through calibration, which is based on an optimization algorithm systematically altering the physical model parameters, until a minimal error is reached. Once calibrated, the model is able to predict the distortions caused by the measured magnetic field vector and build an appropriate dewarping function. The time needed for model calibration is not yet optimized and takes up to on a CPU. In contrast, the time needed for distortion correction is less than and therefore absolutely acceptable for intraoperative use. First evaluations showed that by using the model based dewarping algorithm the distortions of an XRII with a FOV could be significantly reduced. The model was able to predict and compensate distortions by approximately 80% to a remaining error of (max) ( rms).

AB  - Abstract:? Introduction:? To assess the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free immunosuppression vs. calcineurin-based immunosuppression in patients receiving expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys. Patient and methods:? Thirteen recipients of ECD kidneys were enrolled in this pilot study and treated with induction therapy and maintained on sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone. A contemporaneous control group was randomly selected comprised of 13 recipients of ECD kidneys who had been maintained on CNI plus MMF and prednisone. Results:? For the study group vs. the control group, two-yr graft survival was 92.3% vs. 84.6% (p?=?NS), two-yr patient survival was 100% vs. 92.3% (p?=?NS) and the acute rejection rates were 23% vs. 31% (p?=?NS), respectively. Renal function was significantly better in the study group compared with control up to the six-month mark, after which, it remained numerically but not statistically significant. Complications were more common in the study group, but serious adverse events requiring discontinuation were rare. Conclusion:? This pilot study demonstrates that CNI-free regimens can be safely implemented in patients receiving ECD kidneys with excellent two-yr patient and graft survival and good renal allograft function. Longer follow-up in larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish these findings.

AB  - Aim Flexed knee gait can be treated with distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and additional patellar tendon advancement (PTA) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study assesses changes in hamstring muscle tendon length (MTL) and velocity after DFEO (+PTA). Method Nineteen children (mean age 13y [standard deviation 3y] at surgery) with CP and flexed knee gait who were treated with DFEO (15 limbs) or DFEO+PTA (10 limbs) were retrospectively included in this study. Gait analyses were performed preoperatively (E0), 1 year postoperatively (E1), and for 10 limbs additionally 2 to 5 years postoperatively (E2). Hamstring MTL and velocities were assessed at all examination dates using OpenSim. Results Hamstring MTL and velocity did not change significantly over time. From E0 to E1, knee flexion in stance improved for both DFEO and DFEO+PTA (p<0.05), knee flexion in swing only improved after DFEO+PTA (p<0.05). The improved knee flexion in stance and swing was maintained at E2. Interpretation DFEO led to a significant improvement in knee kinematics at E1 which was maintained at E2. DFEO seems to prevent recurrent hamstring tightness but does not lead to lengthened or fastened hamstrings. What this paper adds Distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) does not change hamstring muscle tendon length. DFEO does not change hamstring lengthening velocity. DFEO leads to a significant improvement in knee kinematics. Changes in knee kinematics after DFEO can be maintained at mid-term. DFEO seems to prevent recurrent hamstring tightness.

AB  - Abstract We document evidence for trophy-taking and dismemberment with a new bioarchaeological database featuring 13,453 individuals from prehistoric central California sites. Our study reveals 76 individuals with perimortem removal of body parts consistent with trophy-taking or dismemberment; nine of these individuals display multiple types of trophy-taking and dismemberment for a total of 87 cases. Cases span almost 5,000 years, from the Early Period (3000?500 BC) to the Late Period (AD 900?1700). Collectively, these individuals share traits that distinguish them from the rest of the population: a high frequency of young adult males, an increased frequency of associated trauma, and a tendency towards multiple burials and haphazard burial positions. Eight examples of human bone artifacts were also found that appear related to trophy-taking. These characteristics suggest that trophy-taking and dismemberment were an important part of the warfare practices of central Californian tribes. Temporally, the two practices soared in the Early/Middle Transition Period (500?200 BC), which may have reflected a more complex sociopolitical system that encouraged the use of trophies for status acquisition, as well as the migration of outside groups that resulted in intensified conflict. Overall, trophy-taking and dismemberment appear to have been the product of the social geography of prehistoric central California, where culturally differentiated tribes lived in close proximity to their enemies.

AB  - Abstract Background Obesity is common in the equine population and it has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality in humans. The effect of increased body mass index (BMI) on the incidence of surgical site infections has not been investigated in horses. Objectives To determine whether horses with increased body fat, as estimated by BMI, are more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly incisional complications, following emergency ventral midline celiotomy. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional clinical study. Methods Medical records of horses >2 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomy between January 2010 and September 2018 with follow-up of a minimum of 30 post-operative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, operative details and outcome. BMI was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) by the withers height squared (m2). Results In all, 287 horses fit inclusion criteria. Incisional complication prevalence was 23.7%. Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median 203.6 kg/m2, IQR = 191.5-217.4) compared with those without (median 199.1 kg/m2, IQR = 184.7-210.2) (P = .03). Multi-variable analysis of the effects of age, sex, breed and presence of metabolic disease on the association between BMI and risk of incisional complications, identified a tendency towards increased risk with a higher BMI, but statistical significance decreased to P = .07. Breed had an association with BMI (P < .01), but not with incisional complication risk. Main limitations BMI as an estimate of body fat has limitations. Retrospective studies with reliance on owners reporting data and complete medical records is imperfect. When the data were subjected to multi-variable analysis, the trend towards an increased incidence of incisional complications in horses with higher BMI persisted but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion Higher BMI may increase the risk for the development of incisional complications in horses following emergency ventral midline celiotomy.

AB  - Abstract Epistaxis or nosebleed refers to bleeding from the nostrils, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. Occasional cases may present with torrential lethal hemorrhage. Three cases are reported to demonstrate particular features: Case 1: A 51-year-old woman with lethal epistaxis with no obvious bleeding source; Case 2: A 77-year-old man with treated nasopharyngeal carcinoma who died from epistaxis arising from a markedly neovascularized tumor bed; Case 3: A 2-year-old boy with hemophilia B who died from epistaxis with airway obstruction in addition to gastrointestinal bleeding. Epistaxis may be associated with trauma, tumors, vascular malformations, bleeding diatheses, infections, pregnancy, endometriosis, and a variety of different drugs. Careful dissection of the nasal cavity is required to locate the site of hemorrhage and to identify any predisposing conditions. This may be guided by postmortem computerized tomographic angiography (PCTA). Despite careful dissection, however, a source of bleeding may never be identified.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.
