AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Abstract The success of implantation of materials into bone is governed by effective osseointegration, requiring biocompatibility of the material and the attachment and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D?printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D?printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

AB  - Abstract Young separated refugees are exiled from familiar places and on seeking asylum encounter new, potentially alienating, places. Yet, there is limited research regarding the effects of location on the psychological experiences of young separated refugees. This study explores the relationships that young adults who arrived in the UK as separated refugees have with the spaces that they inhabit and the consequences of these. It draws on qualitative interviews with young men from Iraq and Afghanistan who are living in London. Four key themes emerged from the analysis. Participants felt frustrated in bureaucratic settings where processes of labelling and physical manipulation prevented their sense of subjectivity from being expressed. Certain community spaces offered a rich range of support. Micro-spaces of belonging and embodied processes of exploration in the wider community were also reported to be psychologically beneficial. The themes suggest that considerations of young separated refugees' relations to place may provide alternative psychological understandings of their experiences, particularly in relation to concepts such as trauma. Policy implications related to immigration control and the benefits of community projects are highlighted. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sacroiliac joint injuries can cause poor performance; however, the interaction between pelvic mechanics and the sacroiliac joint is poorly understood. Objective: To measure pelvic displacement during 3D sacroiliac joint loading. Methods: Nine reflective triads were attached rigidly to bony prominences in sacropelvic specimens harvested from 14 horses for stereophotogrammetric analysis of triad displacements and joint kinematics. The sacrum was coupled to a load cell and mounted vertically within a material testing system (MTS). A pneumatic actuator was used to apply 90 Nm moments to the ischial arch to simulate nutation-counternutation and left and right lateral bending of the sacroiliac joints. Axial rotation of the sacrum was induced by torsion of the upper MTS fixture. Vectors of marker displacement within orthogonal planes of motion were measured during loading of the sacropelvic specimens. Comparisons in the magnitude and direction of triad displacements were made between paired left-right markers and paired loading conditions. Results: Nutation-counternutation of the sacroiliac joint caused vertical displacement of the ischial tuberosities and cranial-caudal displacement of the wings of the ilium. Lateral bending induced rotational displacement within the horizontal plane of all pelvic landmarks, relative to the sacrum. Axial rotation of the sacrum caused elevation of the wing of the ilium ipsilateral to the direction of sacral rotation and depression of the contralateral ilial wing. Significant paired left-right differences occurred during most sacroiliac joint loading conditions. Comparable magnitudes of pelvic displacement were measured during nutation-counternutation, left and right lateral bending, and left and right axial rotation. Conclusions: The equine pelvis is not a rigid structure and asymmetric pelvic deformation occurs during most sacroiliac joint movements. Clinical relevance: Bony pelvic deformation should be considered a normal response to any sacroiliac joint movement.

AB  - Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, is now a widely used tool in pre-operative planning, surgical teaching and simulator training. However, 3D printing technology that produces models with accurate haptic feedback, biomechanics and visuals for the training surgeon is not currently available. Challenges and opportunities in creating such surgical models will be discussed in this review paper. Surgery requires proper tissue handling as well as knowledge of relevant anatomy. To prepare doctors properly, training models need to take into account the biomechanical properties of the anatomical structures that will be manipulated in any given operation. This review summarises and evaluates the current biomechanical literature as it relates to human tissues and correlates the impact of this knowledge on developing high fidelity 3D printed surgical training models. We conclude that, currently, a printer technology has not yet been developed which can replicate many of the critical qualities of human tissue. Advances in 3D printing technology will be required to allow the printing of multi-material products to achieve the mechanical properties required.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an elevated risk of post-operative complications. The impact it has on patients living with DM following hip fracture surgery (HFS) is not completely understood and may represent a predictor of increased mortality. This study investigates the impact of DM, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and fracture location, on the outcome of HFS in Ireland. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database records all fragility hip fractures within Galway University Hospital. Retrospective data collection was performed over a 3-year period. Data collected included patient age, gender, date of HFS, anatomical fracture location, type of operation, ASA grade, DM status, and mortality. A database of 650 individuals was created including 461 females and 189 males, with an average group age of 80.2?±?9.3 years. Results showed a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in males with DM (19.57%) than females with DM (12.36%) (?2 test, p?=?0.020). Cox regression survival analysis indicated that DM status and ASA grade were the two main independent predictors of patient survival following HFS. Nevertheless, when examining the combined impact of gender and DM status on survival after HFS, results showed that survival post HFS differed significantly with gender and presence of DM (log-rank test, p?<?0.001), with males with DM performing worse than females with DM (p?=?0.021) or males without DM (p?=?0.001). This gender and disease-associated outcome should prompt an early multi-disciplinary team approach to the management of hip fractures in patients with DM. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

AB  - Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) of the testis is known to be the pre-invasive stage of most human germ cell tumours (seminoma and non-seminoma), but the mechanisms leading to an increased pubertal proliferation of CIS cells after a long latency and to progression of CIS to an invasive malignancy are still not known. Additionally, CIS and seminoma have also been reported in equine testis (Veeramachaneni and Sawyer, 1998). The gap junctional protein and tumour suppressor gene connexin(cx)43 represents the predominant cx in human, canine and rodent testis so far and it is expected to play a key role for the regulation of both proliferation and differentiation of germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatocytes), and its gene- and protein-expression pattern is typical for the pubertal terminal differentiation of somatic Sertoli cells. Using cDNA-microarray analysis, in-situ hybridization (ISH), RT-PCR from tissue homogenate and semi-quantitative RT-PCR from well defined microdissected tubules with normal spermatogenesis, CIS, intratubular seminoma (ISe) and from seminoma cells from invasive seminoma we found a downregulation of cx43 starting in intratubular CIS, leading to a complete loss in most invasive seminoma cells. This indicates that regulation of cx43 expression takes place at transcriptional level confirming and expanding earlier studies of protein expression (Brehm et al., 2002). This reduction of cx43-expression suggests that an early intratubular derangement in cx43-gene expression and disruption of inter-cellular communication between Sertoli cells and/or Sertoli cells and pre-invasive tumour cells via cx43-gap junctions may play a role in the proliferation of CIS cells and seminoma cells and in the progression phase of testicular seminoma development.

AB  - Summary Medical records of 143 dogs with pulmonary contusion secondary to motor vehicular trauma were evaluated retrospectively to determine length of hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, and associated injuries. Therapeutic interventions, including the dose of intravenous fluid administration, the use of antibiotics, and the use of glucocorticoids were recorded. Initial thoracicradiographs were reviewed, and pulmonary contusion was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Pulmonary contusion severity was compared to use of supplemental oxygen, oxygen administration time, hospitalization time, and the presence or absence of fractures. The length of hospital stay and the survival rate was calculated. The mean respiratory rate at admission was 55 ± 22 breaths per minute. Concurrent thoracicinjuries were common, and included pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Fifty-two percent ofdogs received oxygen supplementation for a median of 35 hours. The median hospitalization time was 48 hours. Forty (28%) dogs were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and forty- five (31%) were administered glucocorticoids. Two (1%) dogs developed pulmonary infection. Dogs with more severe thoracic radiographic changes on presentation were more likely to receiveoxygen, received oxygen for longer periods of time, and had a longer hospitalization time. Eighty-two percent of dogs survived to hospital discharge.

AB  - Human skeletal remains of sixteen individuals found at Dibba al-Hisn in the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE) are analysed with regard to standard anthropological criteria. They represent the poorly known pre-Islamic period of the first centuries AD. Remains of at least fifteen individuals were recovered from a semi-subterranean grave-chamber together with rich archaeological grave-goods. An additional, almost complete skeleton was found in the open area near the chamber. While the size and nature of the sample prevent demographic analyses, skeletal features studied with the help of macro- and microscopic as well as radiographic methods provide details on individual life histories and living conditions, as well as mortuary habits and taphonomic processes. Of special interest is a case of intentional tooth mutilation as well as two cases of skull trauma apparently caused by violent inter-personal conflict. The results of the analysis of the faunal remains from the grave-chamber and its surroundings are presented in an appendix.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin - the prohormone of calcitonin - has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs). Objectives The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment. Data collection and analysis Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow-up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re-hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients. For the two co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed-effect. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results. Main results We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47, 95% CI -3.78 to -3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses. Authors' conclusions Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non-European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost-effectiveness by considering country-specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin testing to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections Unnecessary antibiotic use significantly contributes to increasing bacterial resistance, medical costs and the risk of drug-related adverse events. The blood marker procalcitonin increases in bacterial infections and decreases when patients recover from the infection. Hence, procalcitonin may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with a clinical suspicion of infection. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that such a strategy works, particularly in patients with an infection of the respiratory tract. However, most of these individual studies did not include enough patients to allow for a conclusive assessment about safety (low statistical power). Thus, the risk for mortality and severe complications associated with procalcitonin-guided decision making remained unclear. This systematic review included individual patient data from 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 4211 participants. When looking at these combined data, we found no increased risk for all-cause mortality or treatment failure when procalcitonin was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in participants with acute respiratory infections compared to control participants. However, we found a consistent reduction of antibiotic use, mainly due to lower prescription rates in primary care and lower duration of antibiotic courses in emergency department and intensive care unit patients. This analysis is limited to adult patients with respiratory infections excluding patients who were immuno-compromised (i.e. HIV positive, those receiving immuno-suppressive therapies or chemotherapy). Most trials were conducted in Europe and China and similar studies in other countries including the United States are warranted.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) tissues, including the brain, the eye, and the spinal cord, are immune-privileged, secluded from the circulation by a complex of barriers, and equipped with their own myeloid cell population, the resident microglia. Based on the classical perspective of immune?brain interactions and on the contribution of such interactions to the progression of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS, infiltrating macrophages were traditionally viewed as an enemy of the nervous system. However, over the past two decades, research has revealed the pivotal role of monocyte-derived macrophages in CNS repair, and opened up a new era in understanding and treating CNS pathologies. Here, we gather current knowledge regarding macrophage broad spectrum of activities in the CNS, whose two poles correspond to the classical pro-inflammatory M1 and the ?alternatively-activated? M2 cells previously described in various non-CNS pathologies, and their diverse, multi-functional contribution in various neurological conditions, ranging from acute traumas to neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The diverse functions are manifested by induction and resolution of inflammation as well as their involvement in neural tissue regeneration and renewal, matrix remodelling, debris clearance, and angiogenesis. A special focus is devoted to current evidence suggesting that resident microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are functionally non-redundant cell types. Taken together, these recent advances reveal a dramatic therapeutic opportunity for controlled harnessing of macrophages for repair of the damaged CNS following acute insults, in neurodegenerative conditions, and in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.
