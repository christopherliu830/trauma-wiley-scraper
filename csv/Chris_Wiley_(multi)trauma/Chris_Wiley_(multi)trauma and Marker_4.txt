AB  - AbstractSevere extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (?CT) and biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole, this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue engineering therapies.

AB  - Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that is associated with very high personal and socioeconomic costs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the relationship between complex trauma and key features of BPD, with a focus on problems with self-coherence and self-continuity. We first review evidence for the high prevalence of complex trauma in BPD patients. This is followed by a discussion of emerging knowledge concerning the biobehavioral mechanisms involved in problems related to self and identity in BPD. We emphasize three biobehavioral systems that are affected by complex trauma and are centrally implicated in identify diffusion in BPD: the attachment system, mentalizing or social cognition, and the capacity for epistemic trust?that is, an openness to the reception of social communication that is personally relevant and of generalizable significance. We formulate a new approach to personality and severe personality disorders, and to problems with self and identity in these disorders, rooted in a social-communicative understanding of the foundations of selfhood. We also discuss how extant evidence-based treatments address the above-mentioned biobehavioral systems involved in identity diffusion in BPD and related disorders, and the supporting evidence. We close the paper with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Summary Teeth have two regions where trauma can cause irreparable damage: the dental pulp and periodontium. The classification of the injury type, and signs and symptoms may not fully indicate the true extent of the injury, which may be multi-factorial. Exposure or near exposure of the pulp in the mouth and damage to the neurovascular bundle can result in one of several different outcomes for the dental pulp. The rate of pulp necrosis with a number of different injuries varies with age and the stage of tooth development. Endodontic treatment would only be commenced if there were signs and symptoms of an endodontic infection. A thorough history and examination are necessary to not only reveal the full extent of injuries to the teeth and jaws, but also to exclude more serious injuries, such as concussion and neck injuries, which may need urgent medical care.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims Despite advances towards integration of care for women with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low abstinence rates following SUD/PTSD treatment remain the norm. The utility of investigating distinct substance use trajectories is a critical innovation in the detection and refining of effective interventions for this clinical population. Design and Methods The present study reanalysed data from the largest randomised clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUD and PTSD in women (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network; Women and Trauma Study). Randomised participants (n?=?353) received one of two interventions in addition to treatment as usual for SUD: (i) trauma-informed integrative treatment for PTSD/SUD; or (ii) an active control psychoeducation course on women's health. The present study utilised latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate women's substance use patterns during the 12-month follow-up period. Results Findings provided support for three different trajectories of substance use in the post-treatment year: (i) consistently low likelihood and use frequency; (ii) consistently high likelihood and use frequency; and (iii) high likelihood and moderate use frequency. Covariate analyses revealed improvement in PTSD severity was associated with membership in a specific substance use trajectory, although receiving trauma-informed treatment was not. Additionally, SUD severity, age and after-care efforts were shown to be related to trajectory membership. Discussion and Conclusions Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use, relevance of trauma-informed care in SUD recovery and benefits of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating SUD treatment outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a lack of research on trauma in people with intellectual disabilities. This study assessed expert consensus on the traumatic potential of a broader range of adverse life events, and differences in symptom manifestation and behavioural symptom equivalents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method The present authors conducted a three-step Delphi survey using a mixed-methods design. Twenty-nine expert raters participated in the survey, and 16 persisted to the final round. Consensus was calculated using the interquartile range. Results Traumatic potential was attributed to adverse life events, particularly revolving around sexuality and autonomy. DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD were rated as partially adequate, with behavioural symptom expression being the main difference to the general population. Conclusion The range of traumatic events should be broadened for people with intellectual disabilities. A specific subset of events need to be defined in future research. Detection of PTSD depends upon determining specific symptom correlates of challenging behaviour.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Summary As one of the most startling and successful of Scorsese's films, Taxi Driver has garnered many critical interpretations. What has come to be known in academia as trauma theory is an amalgamation of different psychological and physiological observations and theorizations that attempt to understand and treat the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder or syndrome (PTSD). One of the most common consequences of psychological trauma is the repetition compulsion. Scorsese's filmic influences are vast, but the film demonstrates the stylistic influence of La Nouvelle Vague, the documentary realism of the Italian neorealists, and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. The link between The Searchers and Taxi Driver is key for understanding a rare representation of veteran's postwar integration in American cinema. Taxi Driver was Scorsese's first critical and commercial success. As a soldier, Bickle was both a disempowered pawn and empowered killer of the Vietnamese population.

AB  - Background and Objectives Smoking rates are markedly higher among trauma-exposed individuals relative to non?trauma-exposed individuals. Extant work suggests that both perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies are independent mechanisms that link trauma-related symptoms and smoking. Yet, no work has examined perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies as potential explanatory variables for the relation between trauma-related symptom severity and smoking in a sequential pathway model. Methods The present study utilized a sample of treatment-seeking, trauma-exposed smokers (n?=?363; 49.0% female) to examine perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies for smoking as potential sequential explanatory variables linking trauma-related symptom severity and nicotine dependence, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and severity of withdrawal-related problems and symptoms during past quit attempts. Results As hypothesized, perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies had a significant sequential indirect effect on trauma-related symptom severity and criterion variables. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Findings further elucidate the complex pathways through which trauma-related symptoms contribute to smoking behavior and cognitions, and highlight the importance of addressing perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies in smoking cessation programs among trauma-exposed individuals.

AB  - Abstract Background To investigate the prevalence of findings of spinal injury on computed tomography (CT) images of pediatric trauma patients and to define indicators for the possible presence of spinal injuries. Methods Spinal CT for pediatric trauma patients (age ≤ 12 years) over a 2-year period was retrospectively evaluated for the presence of findings suggestive of spinal injury. Results Of the 773 patients reviewed, 19 (2.4%) showed traumatic spinal lesions on their spinal CT images. These patients were significantly older than those without spinal lesions (mean age 7.9 ± 3.3 years vs 6.1 ± 3.3 years; P = 0.02). The prevalence of spinal trauma was significantly lower in patients aged 0?8 years than in those aged 9?12 years (P = 0.025). Spinal injury was significantly higher in female patients (P = 0.014). Most of the spinal injuries were located at the lumbar and sacral vertebral levels, and most did not cause neurological complications or require surgical treatment. Important indicators of the possible presence of spinal injuries were pain, tenderness, or ecchymosis over the spine, a low Glasgow Coma Scale score (≤12), head injury (for cervical injuries), or intrathoracic injuries and pelvic fractures (for lumbar and sacral injuries). Conclusions Most spinal CT examinations for the diagnosis of spinal injuries in children did not show positive findings. Thus, many children were exposed to an unnecessary high dose of radiation. New clinical evaluation criteria and indicators should be defined to diagnose spinal injuries and avoid unnecessary radiological examinations.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Background: The kidney is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in children and controversy surrounds some aspects of management. This study looks at the experience of our institution and reviews the literature towards developing an optimal strategy for managing this common childhood injury. Methods: One hundred and forty-two cases of paediatric renal trauma are reported from a catchment population of approximately 240 000 children < 14 years of age over a 12 year period. Injuries were classified into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were regarded as minor injuries (85%) and group 3 and 4 injuries were those with extravasation of urine or pedicle injury (15%). Results: The male:female ratio was 2:I with an average age of 8.5 years. Major renal injuries frequently required large amounts of resuscitation fluid. Associated injuries were present in 41% of all cases with an average of two injuries each. With one exception in each case, the development of complications and the need for early surgery were confined to major injuries. There were no long-term complications. The renal loss rate was 2.1%. Conclusions: Renal injuries can be usefully classified into major or minor by determining whether extravasation of urine or pedicle injury is present. Minor injuries should be managed conservatively. Major injuries causing ongoing haemorrhage require urgent surgery. Other major injuries should be imaged regularly and patients with more severe urinomas benefit from early elective surgery at 2?5 days. In cases where extravasation of urine has not shown clear evidence of settling by 5 days' elective surgery probably results in less morbidity and fewer complications than protracted conservative treatment.

Materials and Methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 869 patients with mandibular fractures were registered. Only the patients with single mandibular fracture were included. The information and data collected included age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of mandibular fracture, and type of dental injury. Results Single mandibular fractures were sustained in 294 (33.8%) patients. Of these, 43.5% (128 patients) presented with associated dental injuries (509 injured teeth). The patients' male/female ratio was 2.46:1 (91 males and 37 females). Patients in 30?39 year age group possessed the highest risk of suffering dental trauma (odds ratio = 2.004, P = 0.014). Road traffic accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (54, 42.2%). Lower-anterior teeth were more often injured in patients with symphysis fracture (P < 0.001), and patients with condylar fracture more frequently sustained upper-posterior teeth injury (P < 0.001). Lower-posterior teeth injury was mostly found in patients with mandibular body fracture (P < 0.001) or angle fracture (P < 0.001). Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (odds ratio = 3.283, P < 0.001), and the risk was only 0.193-fold in patients who sustained only mandible angle fractures (odds ratio = 0.193, P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence and type of dental injury were significantly related to the fracture site of mandible.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with a history of trauma, particularly maltreatment, often have accurate memories for trauma-related events. This does not mean that trauma never adversely affects autobiographical memory performance; indeed, some individuals with a trauma history reveal deficits in their memory performance while others at times show memory advantages over individuals without a trauma history. We posit here that individual differences in memory may be related in part to the emotion dysregulation and psychopathology resulting from the trauma and in part to the nature of the event to be recalled. In this chapter, we focus on the scientific literature on child maltreatment, trauma-related psychopathology, and memory from a developmental psychopathology perspective. We summarize relevant theory and research on memory development, trauma-related psychopathology symptoms, and psychophysiological and neuroscience processes relevant to child maltreatment. We also review behavioral studies on childhood trauma and autobiographical memory development. We discuss the translation of such research into clinical and legal practice. We conclude with future directions for research, with the hope of moving this crucial area of study forward to spawn new insights.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Limited guidelines exist regarding the optimal treatment of traumatic canine elbow luxation, and there is a lack of information on long-term functional outcome. Here we report reduction and stabilisation techniques for a series of traumatic elbow luxations and describe clinical outcome plus long-term questionnaire-based follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of canine traumatic elbow luxations (2006 to 2013) treated at five referral centres. Data recorded included signalment, luxation aetiology, time to reduction, reduction technique, surgical procedure, post-reduction care and complications. Questionnaire follow-up was attempted for all cases with owners completing the Canine Brief Pain Inventory. RESULTS Thirty-seven dogs were included. The most frequent cause of luxation was road traffic accident (n=22). Twenty cases were treated surgically. Seven dogs suffered major postoperative complications: reluxation (n=6), infection requiring implant removal (n=1). Four of the six reluxations occurred in dogs that had other orthopaedic injuries. Twenty-two owners completed the Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire: there were 13 excellent, 6 very good, 1 good and 2 fair outcomes. Outcome was not associated with the reduction technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial closed reduction, followed by surgical stabilisation if unsuccessful, results in good-to-excellent outcomes in the majority of traumatic canine elbow luxations. Reluxation was the most common major complication and there was a higher incidence of reluxation in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the correlation between dental injuries and the pattern of maxillofacial fractures. The correlation with age, gender, trauma mechanism and type of maxillofacial fracture was also investigated. Materials and methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 1131 patients with facial fractures were registered. Of these, 473 presented with associated dental trauma. The information and data collected and analyzed included: age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of facial fracture, type of dental injury, and the relationship between dental injury and facial fracture. Results Dental injury was sustained by 473 patients (41.8%), with a total of 2215 injured teeth. Of the 2215 injured teeth, 1191 (53.8%) were in the maxilla and 1024 (46.2%) in the mandible. Fall from a height had the highest risk of dental injuries (OR = 4.145, P = 0.002). The central incisor was the most injured tooth for both the maxilla (388, 36.2%) and mandible (284, 27.7%). The most common type of dental injury was avulsion (1070, 47.4%). More anterior teeth in the maxilla were of crown fracture, avulsion, and intrusion than that in the mandible, whereas more anterior teeth in the mandible were of subluxation and concussion than that in the maxilla. Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (OR = 2.817, P < 0.001), only 0.236-fold risk in patients who sustained only mandible angle fracture (P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence of dental trauma is significantly related to the pattern and position of the maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Trauma resuscitation is a complex situation, and most organisations have multi-professional trauma teams. Non-technical skills are challenged during trauma resuscitation, and they play an important role in the prevention of critical incidents. Simulation-based training of these is recommended. Our research question was: Does simulation-based trauma team training of non-technical skills have effect on reaction, learning, behaviour or patient outcome? The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and found 13 studies eligible for analysis. We described and compared the educational interventions and the evaluations of effect according to the four Kirkpatrick levels: reaction, learning (knowledge, skills, attitudes), behaviour (in a clinical setting) and patient outcome. No studies were randomised, controlled and blinded, resulting in a moderate to high risk of bias. The multi-professional trauma teams had positive reactions to simulation-based training of non-technical skills. Knowledge and skills improved in all studies evaluating the effect on learning. Three studies found improvements in team performance (behaviour) in the clinical setting. One of these found difficulties in maintaining these skills. Two studies evaluated on patient outcome, of which none showed improvements in mortality, complication rate or duration of hospitalisation. A significant effect on learning was found after simulation-based training of the multi-professional trauma team in non-technical skills. Three studies demonstrated significantly increased clinical team performance. No effect on patient outcome was found. All studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. More comprehensive randomised studies are needed to evaluate the effect on patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of childhood trauma were reviewed. A majority of patients reported some degree of continuous recall. Roughly half (53%) said they had never forgotten the traumatic events. Two smaller groups described a mixture of continuous and delayed recall (17%) or a period of complete amnesia followed by delayed recall (16%). Patients with and without delayed recall did not differ significantly in the proportions reporting corroboration of their memories from other sources. Idiosyncratic, trauma-specific reminders and recent life crises were most commonly cited as precipitants to delayed recall. A previous psychotherapy was cited as a factor in a minority (28%) of cases. By contrast, intrusion of new memories after a period of amnesia was frequently cited as a factor leading to the decision to seek psychotherapy. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the role of psychotherapy in the process of recovering traumatic memories.

AB  - Abstract Dissemination of effective early interventions following trauma is necessary to ensure the provision of the best possible care in a timely manner. To achieve this, agreement from all key stakeholders is required regarding the messages to be disseminated and the means of dissemination. This article is based on a National Institute of Mental Health sponsored symposium on the dissemination of early interventions at the 21st annual meeting of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies in Toronto in 2005. The current knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and dissemination of early interventions (defined here as those that are begun within the first 3 months after exposure) following trauma for children, adolescents, and adults is considered.

AB  - Abstract The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a ?pathologising? standpoint. Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.) aspects that have been shown to play a role in the subjective experience of various forms of suffering. Psychology has for a long time been quick to diagnose victims of traumatic experiences from an individualistic perspective, almost always positioning the ?problem? within the person. As a result of the Vietnam War, World Wars I and II and the Holocaust, the rise in the diagnosing of PTSD gave way to the labelling of trauma. Within psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder has become the way to operationalise suffering, and I would like to argue that this occludes how suffering lives in a family, a community and in gendered bodies. The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space. There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual. Women have remained, and in many ways continue to remain, silenced with minimal opportunities to name the world for themselves. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of the notion of trauma (and its intersection with gender) that arises from conflict and post-conflict situations.
