AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract Fractures are one of the most common large-organ, traumatic injuries in humans, and osteoporosis-related fractures are the fastest growing health care problem of aging. Elective orthopedic surgeries of the bones and joints also represent some of most common forms of elective surgeries performed. Optimal repair of skeletal tissues is necessary for successful outcomes of these many different orthopedic surgical treatments. Research focused on post-natal skeletal repair is therefore of immense clinical importance and of particular relevance in situations in which bone tissue healing is compromised due to the extent of tissue trauma or specific medical co-morbidities. Three commonly used murine surgical models of bone healing, closed fracture with intramedullary fixation, distraction osteogenesis (DO), and marrow ablation by reaming, are presented. The biological aspects of these models are contrasted and the types of research questions that may be addressed with these models are presented. ? 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Summary The most common cause of late kidney transplant failure is chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Much research has focused on identifying biomarkers (or correlates) that would predict subsequent CAN and allow timely intervention. Functional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have been widely adopted, even though they have not been rigorously evaluated as surrogate markers. This study evaluated serum creatinine and eGFR for predicting the early histopathological changes seen in transplant protocol biopsies (TPB). We prospectively followed 289 kidney transplant patients in the Southern Alberta Transplant Program who had TPB at 6?12?months post-transplant. Tissue samples (n?=?280) were independently examined by renal pathologists. The ability of serum creatinine or eGFR to predict the threshold level for abnormal histopathology was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Serum creatinine and eGFR had poor predictive value (most confidence intervals included 0.5, indicating no predictive ability) for ten individual histological measurements (Banff 97 scores), and the Chronic Allograft Damage Index. We conclude that serum creatinine and eGFR have a limited clinical role in predicting the early histopathological changes that precede CAN and should not be used for this purpose.

AB  - Background and Objective Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has been revealed as a potential means to improve wound healing. So far, most studies are being performed with irradiation in the red to near-infrared spectra. Recently, we showed that blue light (470?nm) can significantly influence biological systems such as nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and is able to release NO from nitrosyl-hemoglobin or mitochondrial protein complexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic value of blue or red light emitting diodes (LEDs) on wound healing in an ischemia disturbed rodent flap model. Study Design/Materials and Methods An abdominal flap was rendered ischemic by ligation of one epigastric bundle and subjected to LED illumination with a wavelength of 470?nm (blue, n?=?8) or 629?nm (red, n?=?8) each at 50?mW/cm2 and compared to a non-treated control group (n?=?8). Illumination was performed for 10?minutes on five consecutive days. Results LED therapy with both wavelengths significantly increased angiogenesis in the sub-epidermal layer and intramuscularly (panniculus carnosus muscle) which was associated with significantly improved tissue perfusion 7 days after the ischemic insult. Accordingly, tissue necrosis was significantly reduced and shrinkage significantly less pronounced in the LED-treated groups of both wavelengths. Conclusions LED treatment of ischemia challenged tissue improved early wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis irrespective of the wavelength thus delineating this noninvasive means as a potential, cost effective tool in complicated wounds.

AB  - The conflict in Northern Ireland left over 3,600 people dead and tens of thousands injured, but establishing who are victims and the very nature of victimhood has been difficult. In part this is due to the highly contested nature of the labels ?victim? and ?terrorist.? The present paper employed interpretative phenomenological analysis to gain a greater understanding of the conceptualisation of victimhood in Northern Ireland. Catholic and Protestant civilians, paramilitaries, politicians, security force personnel, and community activists who had experienced direct and/or indirect political violence were interviewed. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five themes related to internal, interpersonal, and macro aspects of victimhood. The participants illustrated how the label of victim was associated with both weakness and strength, depending on the audience. Interview responses also revealed that although participants were resilient, they suffered at least some temporary psychological trauma due to their exposure to political violence. In addition the analysis indicated that there was a psychological cost associated with perpetrating acts of political violence. These findings are discussed in relation to the need for a national or cross-national program of intergroup dialogue and truth recovery to provide closure to victims and reintegrate victims and perpetrators into the postconflict society.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to investigate the possibility of obtaining the beginning and end of stance from a girth-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), by comparing data from the IMU with data from an opto-electronic system. Methods 15 horses were trotted on a treadmill, with markers on hooves and a Girth Marker (GM) on a wireless IMU over the sternum. Proreflex cameras collected 3D marker data. T-tests and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to decipher any difference between diagonally paired limbs; GM and hoof markers; and GM and IMU, the limits of agreement of which were also assessed using a Bland Altman method. Results Timings of diagonally-coupled limbs were not significantly different at beginning (P?=?0.77 and 0.95), or end of stance (P?= 0.60 and 0.46) for right or left diagonal respectively. The diagonal in stance was identifiable from GM y position, with which IMU derived position had 97%, and IMU roll 100% agreement. Stance according to hoof markers did not differ significantly from GM z acceleration at beginning (P?= 0.49?±?0.01, P?= 0.92?±?0.007), or GM z velocity at end (P?= 0.84?±?0.007, P?= 0.83?±?0.007), in right or left diagonal respectively. A strong correlation was seen between beginning and end of stance according to GM and IMU events (each R2>0.99). Relationships between IMU and GM amplitudes were less convincing, with a significant difference at peak acceleration (P<0.05, Standard Deviation?=?2.70?m/s/s, ULOA?=?5.93, LLOA?=??4.66). Conclusions A girth-based IMU can identify temporal stride characteristics in trot on a treadmill, but inferences from amplitude data should be treated with caution until further investigated.

AB  - This is an account of how a civilization works through the problems it faces when it is threatened with destruction. It focuses on the example of the Crow Nation, an Indian tribe of the northwest plains of North America, and their last great chief Plenty Coups. Psychoanalytic ideas play a crucial role in explaining how a creative response was possible. In particular, their collective use of dream-visions and dream-interpretation made possible the creation of a new ego ideal for the tribe. This allowed for the transformation of traditional allocations of shame and humiliation. It also allowed for the possibility of transformation of psychological structure. And it opened up new possibilities for what might count as flourishing as a Crow. Conversely, the threat of civilizational collapse allows us to see new possibilities for the conceptual development of psychoanalysis. In particular, psychoanalysis needs to recognize that destruction can occur at the level of the culture while the individuals are not physically harmed. The psychological states of these individuals can be various and complex and cannot be neatly summed up under the category of trauma. A culture can be devastated, while there is no one-to-one relation to the psychological states of the individuals who participate in that culture. It is also true that a collapse of a way of life makes a variety of psychological states impossible. Coming to understand these phenomena is essential to understanding how a culture works through threats to its very existence.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.

AB  - Abstract Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are typically used as a cell source for the reconstruction of hollow organs by conventional tissue engineering techniques. However, the necessity for and advantage of the use of tissue-specific SMCs are unknown. The present study investigated the phenotypic changes that occur following isolation and in vitro expansion of rat SMC populations isolated from three different tissues: the aorta, oesophagus and urinary bladder. rSMCs were isolated by enzymatic dispersion and expanded by conventional cell culture techniques, yielding microscopically homogeneous populations. SMC phenotypes were monitored according to their expression of marker proteins during the first two passages. Two of the three SMC populations (rSMC-a and rSMC-e) showed a marked change in their marker protein profiles during the first two passages, which resulted in a homogeneous phenotype that was neither fully contractile nor fully synthetic. SMCs from the urinary bladder did not show such a shift. Differences between the three rSMC populations were observed with regard to proliferative activity and gene expression patterns, suggesting the retention of some tissue-specific cell characteristics. In summary, phenotypic changes in SMCs occur as a result of conventional cell isolation and expansion techniques, thus questioning the necessity for a tissue-specific cell source for regenerative medicine applications.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare cardiac risk stratification using a 0 and 2?h point-of-care (POC) cardiac troponin (cTn), 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers against the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn reference standard. Methods A prospective observational study of ED patients presenting with chest pain was performed. Patients were risk stratified and treated as per the Heart Foundation of Australia/Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (HF-A/CS-ANZ) guidelines using the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn (T6). Patients were further stratified using a 0 and 2?h POC cTn (T2) plus 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers (cTn, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin) (M2). The T6, T2 and M2 strategies were compared using the 30-day major adverse cardiac events as the primary outcome. Results Seven hundred and four patients (median age 54 years, male 62.1%) were enrolled. Using the T6 reference standard, 2%, 61% and 37% were stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The 30-day event rates were 0%, 3.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The T2 strategy stratified 1.5%, 57% and 41% as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 4.2% and 24.8%, respectively. The M2 strategy resulted in significantly different risk distribution with 1%, 40% and 59% stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 3.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Conclusion Using a 2?h POC cTn-only biomarker strategy with the HF-A/CS-ANZ guidelines accurately identified a population at intermediate risk of 30-day events in whom further objective testing might be accelerated, allowing subsequent early discharge of the majority of this cohort. Within 2?h of presentation a high risk population could be identified in whom early management, including admission, was required.

AB  - Summary.? The Middle and Late Iron Age samples of disarticulated human remains from the settlement site of Gussage All Saints and the hillfort of Maiden Castle (Dorset, England) were investigated for evidence of funerary rites. The samples were examined using osteological, forensic and archaeological methodologies for evidence of excarnation and secondary burial. The study found evidence for dry-fractures, animal gnawing and peri-mortem trauma, indicating that many individuals had received blunt-force cranial fractures and/or weapon injuries at the time of death. The taphonomic indicators showed that bodies were excarnated, received secondary burial treatment and then selected skull and long bones were incorporated into structured deposits. Osteological analysis also showed that the majority of individuals were adult males, which corresponded to patterns of trauma in the inhumated sample from Dorset. Two bones also provided unique evidence within Dorset for the cultural modification of human remains.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Cell-based tissue engineering is a promising approach for treating cartilage lesions, but available strategies still provide a distinct composition of the extracellular matrix and an inferior mechanical property compared to native cartilage. To achieve fully functional tissue replacement more rationally designed biomaterials may be needed, introducing bioactive molecules which modulate cell behavior and guide tissue regeneration. This study aimed at exploring the impact of cell-instructive, adhesion-binding (GCWGGRGDSP called RGD) and collagen-binding (CKLER/CWYRGRL) peptides, incorporated in a tunable, matrixmetalloprotease (MMP)-responsive multi-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG)/heparin hydrogel on cartilage regeneration parameters in vitro and in vivo. MMP-responsive-starPEG-conjugates with cysteine termini and heparin-maleimide, optionally pre-functionalized with RGD, CKLER, CWYRGRL or control peptides, were cross-linked by Michael type addition to embed and grow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or chondrocytes. While starPEG/heparin-hydrogel strongly supported chondrogenesis of MSC according to COL2A1, BGN and ACAN induction, MMP-degradability enhanced cell viability and proliferation. RGD-modification of the gels promoted cell spreading with intense cell network formation without negative effects on chondrogenesis. However, CKLER and CWYRGRL were unable to enhance the collagen content of constructs. RGD-modification allowed more even collagen type II distribution by chondrocytes throughout the MMP-responsive constructs, especially in vivo. Collectively, peptide-instruction via heparin-enriched MMP-degradable starPEG allowed adjustment of self-renewal, cell morphology and cartilage matrix distribution in order to guide MSC and chondrocyte-based cartilage regeneration towards an improved outcome.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article explores the various psychosocial problems that children and adolescents experienced due to communal violence in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002. Five strategies were adapted to provide support and care to the children and adolescents in the relief camps as well as in the community during the rehabilitation phase. Community volunteers were used in the program to facilitate psychosocial healing by using different mediums of expression. Each medium encouraged the expression of thoughts and feelings caused by the trauma and the building of hope for the future. Various community-oriented peace-building measures, which are explained and outlined, were adapted to build trusting inter-community relationships. The peace-building measures focused on rebuilding a nurturing environment by re-establishing community networks and social support systems. Life skills education was one of the approaches adopted for fostering psychosocial development among the children in order to restore peaceful cohabitation for a future based on mutual respect and acceptance. Ultimately, in disaster rehabilitation, rebuilding one's ?sense of place? through holistic psychosocial support has been highlighted as a model for practice. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rationale Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pancreatic disease with poor prognosis and pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal types of cancer that is symptomless in the early stage. Because the clinical and image findings of CP can overlap that of pancreatic cancer (PC) which leads to confusion in the diagnosis and treatment of PC, discovery/verification/validation of more accurate protein biomarkers to diagnose CP and PC is in urgent need. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords: ?biomarker?, ?marker?, ?chronic pancreatitis?, ?pancreatic cancer? or ?proteomics? for highly related researches. We focused on the articles published after the year 2005 in this review. Results We introduce the background to CP and PC and summarize the diagnosis of CP and PC, analytically validated protein biomarkers, and proteomic approaches for discovery/verification/validation. The potential use of mass spectrometry (MS) in clinical diagnosis is also discussed. Conclusions Continuously improving sensitivity of MS can provide deeper proteome for new marker discovery and high reliability for protein marker verification, validation, and clinical diagnosis. The analytically validated protein markers could be considered as targeted protein biomarkers for developing a MS platform in the clinical validation process or clinical diagnosis of CP and PC.

AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.
