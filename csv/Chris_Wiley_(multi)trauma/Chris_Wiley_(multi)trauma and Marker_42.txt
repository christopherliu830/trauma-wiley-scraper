AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the potential utility of cytokine and arachidonic acid metabolite levels in ED patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a predictor of progression to severe sepsis. Methods: A prospective, observational study of test performance was performed using convenience samples of adult control subjects and admitted patients. The latter patients were identified in the ED as having signs of SIRS. Levels of cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites measured from specimens obtained in the ED were compared between groups and associated with the progression of sepsis within 24 hours in the SIRS patients. Results: There were 30 control patients and 29 SIRS patients. There were 8 SIRS subjects who progressed to severe sepsis within 24 hours using the following criteria (hypotension, n = 5; hypoperfusion, n = 1; and organ dysfunction, n = 2). Of the 21 SIRS subjects who did not progress to severe sepsis, 11 had resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours. There were no significant differences in mean mediator levels between the SIRS patients who progressed to severe sepsis and those who did not. Of the 11 patients with resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours, the mean interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly lower than that for the patients who did not recover or who progressed at 24 hours (n = 18); 65.4 ± 49.1 vs 230 ±112 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Six of 15 subjects with IL-6 >150 pg/mL progressed to severe sepsis (p = NS). Using threshold values based on the range of levels for normals, the sensitivity of an abnormal marker for the development of severe sepsis within 24 hours varied from 50% to 87%, while the specificity varied from 11% to 84%. Conclusion: While mean levels were significantly elevated when compared with those of normal control subjects, they had limited ability to predict the subset of patients likely to progress to severe sepsis. However, initial low levels of cytokines may have exclusionary prognostic value. Prospective validation of the latter finding is warranted.

AB  - Abstract The stability of orthopedic implants is governed by the interaction between the material's surface and bone cells. Nanosized structures seem to be promising in supporting the osseointegration of total joint replacements. In order to analyze whether nanostructured titanium surfaces, as generated by a short-pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser irradiation process developed in the aeronautics and space industry as a ?cold ablation? process, can be useful for orthopedic applications, their impact on bone cells is evaluated in vitro. Cell spreading and morphology on nanostructured titanium niobium nitride or titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces are comparable to osteoblast behavior on corresponding untreated titanium or cells grown on cover glass. However, on the nanostructured surfaces cell numbers appear to be reduced. Nonetheless, cell viability is not affected by laser pretreatment. Interestingly, osteoblast proliferation on nanostructured titanium is inhibited to the benefit of an increased production of osteoblast-specific proteins such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or procollagen. Furthermore, an enhanced mineralization of cells grown on nanostructured surfaces is confirmed in terms of an elevated hydroxyapatite deposition. Laser irradiation leads to an additional nanostructure on microstructured titanium surfaces and might positively affect the biocompatibility and ingrowth of prostheses made from the corresponding biomaterials.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Summary ?? Primary vascular pattern determines pathways of long distance transport for water, nutrients and signalling molecules within plant shoot systems. ?? Expression of an Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene 8::GUS construct is restricted to the procambium and provides a molecular marker for vascular pattern at early developmental stages. ?? Primary vascular pattern and phyllotaxis are highly coordinated, with vascular sympodia corresponding to phyllotactic parastichies. During vegetative development, primary vasculature forms a reticulate pattern, with each leaf trace derived from two vascular sympodia. Shoot phase change is marked by alterations of this fundamental pattern. Formation of leaf trace procambial strands is temporally coordinated with primordium initiation, but ATHB-8::GUS expression is discontinuous in these strands at early stages. ?? The interconnection of vascular sympodia provides alternate pathways for long distance transport in shoots of A. thaliana and reflects the limited secondary growth in this species. ATHB-8::GUS expression identifies a prepattern that precedes anatomical definition of procambium. The longitudinal discontinuity in ATHB-8::GUS expression indicates that one function of this gene is to define the xylem components of vascular radial pattern.

KW  - colorectal injury
KW  - colostomy
KW  - primary repair
PY  - 1996
AB  - Background: The chief danger of colonic injury is sepsis resulting from faecal spill. Primary repair is now well established in the USA, particularly for penetrating injuries, in up to 81% of patients. However, in Australia, highly destructive blunt trauma forms a larger proportion of injuries, and the purpose of this study was to determine if there are any contrasts in the management of these patients. Method: A retrospective survey was undertaken over the past 20 years of all of the patients with full-thickness colorectal injuries presenting at the three major hospitals which receive multi-trauma patients in Brisbane. Results: Of 112 patients 114 sustained full-thickness colorectal injuries. Forty patients had penetrating injuries, 41 had blunt injuries and 33 had iatrogenic injuries. Primary repair or resection and anastomosis was performed in 39% of patients with colonic injuries and the leak rate was 8%. Exteriorized repairs had a 67% leak rate. A colostomy was used in 58% of patients. The mortality for penetrating injuries was zero. The mortality for blunt colonic injuries was 17% and for iatrogenic injuries was 7% but for blunt rectal injuries was 50%. The overall mortality was 10%. Colostomy closure had a 20% morbidity but no mortality. Conclusions: In the absence of shock, associated injuries, or gross faecal soiling primary repair or resection with anastomosis may be considered. For blunt injury, colostomy is still usually indicated, often with resection. For iatrogenic injury, when seen early, primary repair can be performed. We do not recommend exteriorized repair. Extraperitoneal rectal injuries require proximal colostomy and distal washout, with drainage where appropriate. Blunt devitalizing injury is relatively more common in Australia than in the USA and therefore there is less indication here for primary repair. Colostomy remains an important consideration in operative management.

AB  - Abstract Putaminal metabolites examined using cross-sectional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can distinguish pre-manifest and early Huntington's Disease (HD) individuals from controls. An ideal biomarker, however, will demonstrate longitudinal change over short durations. The objective here was to evaluate longitudinal in vivo brain metabolite profiles in HD over 24 months. Eighty-four participants (30 controls, 25 pre-manifest HD, 29 early HD) recruited as part of TRACK-HD were imaged at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months using 3T MRS of left putamen. Automated putaminal volume measurement was performed simultaneously. To quantify partial volume effects, spectroscopy was performed in a second, white matter voxel adjacent to putamen in six subjects. Subjects underwent TRACK-HD motor assessment. Statistical analyses included linear regression and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). At all time-points N-acetyl aspartate and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), neuronal integrity markers, were lower in early HD than in controls. Total NAA was lower in pre-manifest HD than in controls, whereas the gliosis marker myo-inositol (MI) was robustly elevated in early HD. Metabolites were stable over 24 months with no longitudinal change. Total NAA was not markedly different in adjacent white matter than putamen, arguing against partial volume confounding effects in cross-sectional group differences. Total NAA correlations with disease burden score suggest that this metabolite may be useful in identifying neurochemical responses to therapeutic agents. We demonstrate almost consistent group differences in putaminal metabolites in HD-affected individuals compared with controls over 24 months. Future work establishing spectroscopy as an HD biomarker should include multi-site assessments in large, pathologically diverse cohorts. ? 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Abstract The incidence of chronic wounds is increased among older adults, and the impact of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. It is well established that wound healing slows with age. However, the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The impact of age and accompanying multi-morbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables, lack of standardization in data collection, and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this paper, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify key research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify strengths and weaknesses in current studies with a view to carrying out a major multi-center study in Australia. Methods:? The literature was reviewed using standard Medline and Ovid methods. Bibliography of well known key recent papers were used to identify further papers. Results:? Studies evaluating persistent pain after breast cancer surgery have been small and few were prospective controlled studies with adequate power. Like Jung et?al[1] we found that the literature was inconsistent in defining chronic pain and differentiating the breast cancer surgery pain syndromes. Marked variations in prior studies are due to differences in: study size (n?=?22 to 282 patients), methodology, diagnostic criteria, pain assessment instruments, and distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics in the samples studied. Unfortunately the largest study to date, the ALMANAC Trial (n?=?1031) which compared sentinel node biopsy vs ?standard axillary dissection? evaluated arm and shoulder function and quality of life, but not pain[2]. From the current literature, it appears that neuropathic breast and arm pain are most common. Widely varying prevalence estimates of different neuropathic pain syndromes have been reported: phantom breast pain (3?44%); intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) (16?39%); ICBN in breast conserving surgery (14?61%); and ?neuroma pain? (23?49%). The most established risk factors for surgically related neuropathic pain syndromes are intraoperative nerve trauma, severe acute postoperative pain, and high use of postoperative analgesics[1]. Psychosocial distress is reported to be a risk factor and a consequence of chronic pain[1]. Conclusions:? Well-designed large multi-center studies are required to identify prevalences of various pain types, associated risk factors and treatment success for pain after breast cancer surgery. Such a study is in progress through the collaboration of our group with the Sentinel Node vs Axillary Clearance (SNAC) Study of 1000 women following breast surgery, conducted by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS).

AB  - Abstract Aims:? To develop a novel procedure for isolating and characterizing cryptococcal cell-surface proteins using biotinylation, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)?streptavidin, flow cytometry and associated ligand-receptor analysis, confocal microscopy and electrophoretic separation. Methods and Results:? Cell proteins of both acapsulate and encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans cells were labelled using sulfo-NHS-biotin which, in turn, was complexed with FITC?streptavidin. Resulting cell population fluorescence supported visualization of cell-surface protein distribution by confocal microscopy, as well as evaluation of protein exposure by flow cytometry and the calculation of the ligand-binding determinants EC50, Fmax and Hn. Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins also supported their isolation by affinity chromatography and characterization by SDS/PAGE. Ligand-binding determinants, such as EC50 values, indicated that acapsulate and stationary phase cells have greatest affinity for biotin. Fmax values demonstrated greatest protein exposure among stationary phase cells; in turn, encapsulated cells expose more protein than acapsulate counterparts. Hn values of below unity potentially confirm the complex multi-receptor nature of biotin binding to cryptococcal cell surfaces under investigation. Fluorescence visualization showed marked but localized fluorescence indicative of protein exposure around sites of cell division. In turn, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins and their release under reducing conditions demonstrated at least two noncovalently linked proteinaceous entities, of 43 and 57?kDa, exposed on acapsulate cryptococcal cell walls. Conclusions:? A novel method for identifying, in situ, cell-surface proteins exposed by C. neoformans was established. This novel technique was successfully implemented using both acapsulate and encapsulated C. neoformans cells, both were found to have dynamic and markedly localized protein distribution around sites of cell division and associated cell wall trauma. Significance and Impact of the Study:? A novel procedure, employing a versatile combination of flow cytometry, ligand-receptor analysis, confocal microscopy and biotinylation, supported the characterization and isolation of cryptococcal cell-surface proteins.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge Fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify stability in cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficient canine stifles with hamstring grafts affixed at 3 femoral locations. Study Design Canine stifle motion study using a multi-cohort, repeated measures design. Sample Population 27 canine cadaver stifles. Methods Hamstring grafts (HG) were affixed at the gracilis-semitendinosus insertion and on the lateral femur (1) proximal trochlear ridge (TR), (2) craniodistal to fabella (F), or (3) condyle center (CC). Total, cranial, and caudal tibial translation and total, medial, and lateral angular displacement, with and without translational load, were quantified with the CrCL intact, transected, and reconstructed. Angular displacement was quantified from points on the distal femur and proximal tibia. Graft strain was calculated from tissue displacement measured at joint angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°. Results Tibial translation was lowest in F constructs, which also achieved the least difference in tibial translation from intact stifles. Tibial translation was lower in intact stifles than in CrCL transected or reconstructed stifles. Less angular displacement of the proximal tibia was detected in the medial than in the lateral direction, and tibial displacement was lower in the cranial than the caudal direction. Angular displacement was lowest in the F treatment group. F constructs had the lowest graft strain at joint angles greater than 30°. Conclusions Femoral fixation of a canine hamstring graft craniodistal to the lateral fabella conferred the best joint stability and lowest graft strain in vitro. No fixation method restored joint stability of the intact CrCL.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the sperm morphology and nuclear sperm quality (sperm aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation) in two groups of globozoospermic patients: DPY19L2-mutated patients (n = 6) and SPATA16-mutated patients (n = 2). Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n = 25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00 ± 4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00 ± 16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p < 0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p < 0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - Summary The practice of war surgery has a longstanding relationship with the speciality of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The relationship has often fostered new and often ground-breaking developments in medicine and surgery. The last decade of conflict has been no different. Understanding the history and principles of war surgery is paramount to its practice. This chapter aims to distil the salient practices learnt from recent conflicts through understanding of what wounds soldiers at war and the compounding factors that make surgery more arduous in war conditions. Furthermore, the chapter will give a concise understanding of blast and penetrating injury and develop this in the methods of applying plastic and reconstructive surgery military surgical teams.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - Summary The counter-regulatory mechanisms initiated to limit the overzealous inflammatory process in patients with infectious (sepsis) or non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) led to the concept of ?compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome? (CARS). One major consequence of CARS is the modification of the immune status that could favor the enhanced susceptibility of intensive care patients to nosocomial infections. The expression of surface markers can be modified, and numerous functions of circulating leukocytes are altered in sepsis and SIRS patients, as well as in animal models of sepsis or SIRS. However, this is rather a reprogramming of circulating leukocytes, since there is not a global defect of the immune cells functions.
