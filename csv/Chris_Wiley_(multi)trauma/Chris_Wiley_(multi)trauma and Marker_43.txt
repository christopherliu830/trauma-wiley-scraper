AB  - The anatomy of the cervical spine musculature visible on magnetic resonance (MR) images is poorly described in the literature. However, the correct identification of individual muscles is clinically important because certain conditions of the cervical spine, for example whiplash associated disorders, idiopathic neck pain, cervical nerve root avulsion and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, are associated with different morphological changes in specific muscles visible on MR images. Knowledge of the precise structure of different cervical spine muscles is crucial when comparisons with the contralateral side or with normal are required for accurate description of imaging pathology, management and assessment of treatment efficacy. However, learning the intricate arrangement of 27 muscles is challenging. A multi-level cross-sectional depiction combined with three-dimensional reconstructions could facilitate the understanding of this anatomically complex area. This paper presents a comprehensive series of labeled axial MR images from one individual and serves as a reference atlas of the cervical spine musculature to guide clinicians, researchers, and anatomists in the accurate identification of these muscles on MR imaging.

AB  - Nucleosomes, complexes of DNA and histone proteins, are released during cell death into the blood circulation. Elevated serum and plasma levels have been found in various forms of cancer, but also in autoimmune diseases and acute situations such as stroke, trauma, and during sepsis. Here, the clinical relevance of circulating nucleosomes for diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of cancer is reviewed. Several studies have shown that levels of nucleosomes are significantly higher in serum and plasma of cancer patients in comparison to healthy controls. However, because of elevations of nucleosome levels in patients with benign diseases relevant for differential diagnosis, they are not suitable for cancer diagnosis. Concerning tumor staging, nucleosome levels correlate with tumor stage and presence of metastases in gastrointestinal cancer, but not in other tumor types. Prognostic value of circulating nucleosomes is found in lung cancer in univariate analyses, but not in multivariate analyses. Circulating nucleosomes are most informative for the monitoring of cytotoxic therapy. Strongly decreasing levels are mainly found in patients with remission of disease, whereas constantly high or increasing values are associated with progressive disease during chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition, therapy outcome is already indicated by the nucleosomal course during the first week of chemo- and radiotherapy in patients with lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer as well as in hematologic malignancies. Despite their non-tumor-specificity, kinetics of nucleosomes are valuable markers for the early estimation of therapeutic efficacy and may be helpful to adapting early cancer therapy in the future.

AB  - Introduction Clinical trials that involve participants from multiple sites necessitate standardized and reliable quantitative MRI outcomes to detect significant group differences over time. Metabolite concentrations measured by proton MRS (1H-MRS) provide valuable information about in vivo metabolism of the central nervous system, but can vary based on the acquisition and quantitation methods used by different MR sites. Therefore, we investigated the intra- and inter-site reproducibility of metabolite concentrations measured by 1H-MRS on MRI scanners from a single manufacturer across six sites. Methods Five healthy controls were scanned twice within 24 h at six participating 3 T MR sites with large single-voxel PRESS (TE/TR/NSA = 36 ms/4000 ms/56) and anatomical images for voxel positioning and correction of partial volume relaxation. Absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated relative to the T1 and T2 relaxation corrected signal from water. Intra- and inter-site reproducibility was assessed using Bland?Altman plots and intra- and inter-site coefficient of variation (CoV) as well as intra- and inter-site intra-class correlation coefficient. Results The median intra-site CoVs for the five major metabolite concentrations ([NAA], [tCr], [Glu], [tCho] and [Ins]) were between 2.5 and 5.3%. Inter-site CoVs were also low, with the median CoVs for all metabolites between 3.7 and 6.4%. Metabolite concentrations were robust to small inconsistencies in voxel placement and site was not the driving factor in the variance of the measurement of any metabolite concentration. Between-subject differences accounted for the majority of the concentration variability for creatine, choline and myo-inositol (42?65% of the variance). Conclusion A large single-voxel 1H-MRS acquisition from a single manufacturer's MRI scanner is highly reproducible and reliable for multi-site clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Recently there has been an increase in interest in the relationship between stress and memory. Brain regions which are involved in memory function also effect the stress response. Traumatic stress results in changes in these brain regions; alterations in these brain regions in turn may mediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural mechanisms which are relevant to the effects of stress on memory, such as fear conditioning, stress sensitization, and extinction, are reviewed in relation to their implications for PTSD. Special topics including neural mechanisms in dissociation, neurobiological approaches to the validity of childhood memories as they apply to controversies over the ?False Memory Syndrome,? and implications of the effects of stress on memory for psychotherapy, are also reviewed. The findings discussed in this paper are consistent with the formulation that stress-induced alterations in brain regions and systems involved in memory may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD, as well as dissociative amnesia, seen in survivors of traumatic stress.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we draw on the findings of a critical, multi-sited ethnographic study of two rural communities affected by a wildfire in British Columbia, Canada to examine the salience of place, identity, and social capital to the disaster recovery process and community disaster resilience. We argue that a reconfiguration of disaster recovery is required that more meaningfully considers the role of place in the disaster recovery process and opens up the space for a more reflective and intentional consideration of the disorientation and disruption associated with disasters and our organized response to that disorientation. We describe a social-psychological process, reorientation, in which affected individuals and communities navigate the psychological, social and emotional responses to the symbolic and material changes to social and geographic place that result from the fire's destruction. The reorientation process emphasizes the critical importance of place not only as an orienting framework in recovery but also as the ground upon which social capital and community disaster resilience are built. This approach to understanding and responding to the disorientation of disasters has implications for community psychologists and other service providers engaged in supporting disaster survivors. This includes the need to consider the complex dynamic of contextual and cultural factors that influence the disaster recovery process.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the clinical characteristics, types of vascular ring anomalies (VRA), operative findings, complications, and survival after surgical treatment of cats with VRA. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional case series. Animals Client- or shelter-owned cats presenting to academic, referral veterinary institutions. Methods Medical records of cats with VRA that underwent surgical treatment were reviewed. Signalment, relevant medical history, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, complications, and survival were recorded. Results Twenty cats with VRA were included. Vascular ring anomalies were most commonly (75% [15/20]) diagnosed in cats less than 1?year old, with no breed or sex predilection. Regurgitation was the most common clinical sign, present in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. A persistent right aortic arch was diagnosed in 17 of 20 (85%) cats, with concurrent aberrant left subclavian artery in four of the cats. Surgical treatment was associated with survival to discharge in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. Persistent clinical signs were reported in nine of 13 (69%) cats, and radiographic evidence of megaesophagus persisted in four of 13 (31%) cats, with a median follow-up of 275?days after discharge. Conclusion Persistent right aortic arch was the most commonly diagnosed VRA in cats in this series, although multiple anomalies were observed. Surgical treatment of VRA in cats was associated with a high survival to discharge, although persistence of clinical signs and megaesophagus was noted in 69% and 31% of the cats, respectively. Clinical significance Surgical treatment of VRA in cats is associated with a high survival rate; however, persistence of clinical signs is an expected outcome.

AB  - Abstract Aim To examine whether diabetes-specific emotional distress was related to follow-up glycaemic control in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods Adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus completed the Diabetes Distress Scale and reported sociodemographic information when attending a clinical consultation at a university endocrinology unit. Blood samples to determine baseline HbA1c were taken during consultations. All respondents' HbA1c measurements registered from January 2009 to December 2011 were collected from medical records. The relationship between baseline diabetes-specific emotional distress and HbA1c was examined with linear mixed-effects models in 175 patients with complete data. Results After controlling for confounders, baseline diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycaemic control were significantly associated (fixed-effect coefficient 0.40, P < 0.001) and the regimen-related distress subscale had the strongest association with glycaemic control (fixed-effect coefficient 0.47, P < 0.001). The two-item measure of diabetes-specific distress had a weaker but still significant association with glycaemic control (fixed-effect coefficient 0.31, P < 0.001). None of these relationships was significant after adjusting for the baseline HbA1c. Conclusions People with elevated baseline diabetes-specific emotional distress are at risk of prolonged suboptimum glycaemic control; therefore, elevated diabetes-specific emotional distress, especially regimen-related distress, might be an important marker for prolonged suboptimum glycaemic control, and might indicate a need for special attention regarding patient self-management.

AB  - Summary We report the successful use of a stellate ganglion block as part of a multi-modal postoperative analgesic regimen. Four patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery following upper limb trauma underwent blockade of the stellate ganglion pre-operatively under ultrasound guidance. Patients reported excellent postoperative analgesia, with postoperative VAS pain scores between 0 and 2, and consumption of morphine in the first 24 h ranging from 0 to 14?mg. While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a clinical trial, they highlight the potential for stellate ganglion blockade to provide analgesia following major upper limb surgery.

AB  - Summary. Two samples of essay-type answers in examinations of high school graduate candidates were analysed applying a two-way classification scheme. The unit of classification was ?a thought?, expressing by one or more sentences a coherent idea. Both the subject matter treated and the way it was treated were taken into account in the classification of thoughts. The treatment in expressions was rated as reproductive or as elaborative. Consistent with previous findings, the length of an essay answer correlated strongly with grades. Here it is also shown that elaborated thoughts were significantly longer than reproduced ones. Accordingly, the well-known correlation between length and grade is not a triviality: it also reflects qualitative properties of essays which are appreciated by teachers. Among these are the amount of elaboration as well as the amount and quality of school knowledge.

AB  - This report describes a method to teach undergraduate students the knowledge base and skills needed to maximize the educational value of a subsequent cardiothoracic surgical clerkship. Sixty-three fourth year medical students underwent a structured teaching programme in which groups of five students rotated through a series of six teaching stations. Subject material, presented during 20 min at each station, covered the key issues relating to coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, chest trauma, lung cancer, prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers, thoracic sepsis and dysphagia. Group knowledge increased significantly (P < 0.001) from a mean mark of 23% (s.d. 12) in a pre-test to a mean mark of 46% (s.d. 12) in a test conducted 1 month after the teaching. The time taken to conduct the structured teaching/assessment was 5 h compared with 32 h to run the same programme by the traditional ward tutorial system. The dollar cost to stage the structured teaching was less than that to run the traditional tutorial programme. It was concluded that the teaching method is effective, economical and practical and that it has a role in an undergraduate curriculum to prepare students for clinical clerkship.

AB  - Abstract Management of early paracetamol poisoning is dependent on prompt administration of N-acetylcysteine to patients whose plasma concentrations of paracetamol exceed the normal-risk or high-risk treatment lines. Paracetamol poisoning presenting after 15 h since ingestion, especially as fulminant hepatic failure, requires meticulous supportive care of organ dysfunction. The putative mechanisms of action of N-acetylcysteine and its practical use are discussed. The best prognostic marker for paracetamol poisoning in ?established hepatotoxicity? is the prothrombin time. Indications for liver transplantation in paracetamol poisoning and exclusion criteria are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract Mospd1 codes for a small protein with unknown physiological function, which is part of a family of genes, including Mospd2 and Mospd3, defined by the presence of the major sperm protein domain and two transmembrane domains. This work characterizes the Mospd1 gene, the intracellular location of the protein and its expression in different mouse tissues and mesenchymal cell lines during differentiation. The role of Mospd1 in mesenchymal cellular differentiation was studied by siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection experiments of the targeted cDNA show MOSPD1 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Removal of the last exon of the gene resulted in localization of the protein in the nucleus, which was attributed to a nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part. In mouse tissues the gene was generally strongly expressed while mesenchymal tissues showed the highest expression. In mesenchymal cell lines Mospd1 mRNA was higher expressed in cells with advanced differentiation status. In osteoblastic, myoblastic, and adipocytic cell lines Mospd1 was up-regulated during differentiation. Genome-wide gene expression analysis after knockdown of Mospd1 by siRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells revealed a shift in the gene expression pattern from mesenchymal to epithelial genes featuring up-regulation of the epithelial cadherin Cdh1 and down-regulation of its inhibitors Snail1 and 2 and the mesenchymal cadherin Cdh11, suggesting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. From these data we conclude that Mospd1 plays a pivotal role in the developmental regulation at the switch between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Abstract Allogeneic portal vein (PV) grafts have been widely used for vascular reconstruction in the aggressive biliary-pancreatic surgery and partial liver transplantation. We developed a novel PV transplantation model aimed at studying the pathologic alteration of the grafts and further managements. The PV graft was implanted orthotopically into the recipient using two-cuff technique. A total of 80 PV transplants have been performed, and the overall survival rate for the recipients was 91.3% (73/80). Mice were randomly separated into isografts group, allografts group, and allografts group treated with CTLA4-Ig. PV grafts were harvested on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 8th postoperative week. The isografts remained intact vascular structure, and the allografts developed marked rejection with significant increase in wall thickness (95 ± 19 ?m vs. 49 ± 7 ?m; P < 0.01) and decrease in lumen area (1.9 ± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 7.7 ± 3.1 ? 104 ?m2; P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In the CTLA4-Ig treated group, the vascular thickness and lumen area were significantly improved when compared with the untreated allografts (wall-thickness: 53 ± 3 ?m vs. 95 ± 19 ?m, P < 0.01; lumen area: 8.8 ± 2.4 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 1.9 ± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2, P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In conclusion, the PV transplantation model in mice using two-cuff technique is a feasible procedure with a high survival rate. The PV allografts responded well to the CTLA4-Ig therapy in our preliminary research by the model. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2007.

AB  - Abstract Ethical and social issues surround the issue of sexuality and parenting for people with intellectual disabilities. The traumatic history of eugenics is encapsulated in Nazi Germany's description of those with intellectual disability as unworthy of life and the 250?000 children and adults who were gassed but conscious and unconscious wishes to deny sexual and procreative rights to those with an intellectual disability is world-wide and contemporary despite legislative change. However, given the high levels of sexual abuse and exploitation that come from internal and external stigmatisation and trauma the movement towards greater human rights, sexual education and access to psychotherapy heralds new hope for children and adults with an intellectual disability and the wider community. Key Concepts: In working with people with intellectual disability on the themes of sexuality and procreation a multi-disciplinary approach is needed. Ethics, human rights, genetics and psychotherapy are all relevant in working with sexuality and procreation in people with intellectual disability. A history of trauma and eugenics is a necessary prerequisite to understanding the controversial topic of disability, sexuality and procreation. Co-operation with geneticists is important in considering procreation and disability. People with an intellectual disability have a right to their own sexuality.
