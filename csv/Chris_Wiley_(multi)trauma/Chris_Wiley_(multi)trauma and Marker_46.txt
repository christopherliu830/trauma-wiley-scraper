AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify and describe alcohol-related presentations to our ED, as part of the binational Alcohol Harm in Emergency Departments study. Methods A prospective observational study at Royal Perth Hospital of every patient attending ED for the 168-h period commencing 08.00?hours Monday 1 December 2014. Patient presentations were classified as alcohol-related (alcohol-positive) using predefined criteria. These patients were compared to alcohol-negative patients on a range of demographic and clinical descriptors. Results Two hundred and thirteen (15.2%) of 1403 patients screened were alcohol-positive. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male (148/213, 69.5% vs 636/1190, 53.4%, P?<?0.001) and younger (mean 38 years vs 48 years, P?<?0.001). They were more likely to arrive in police custody (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3?9.5, P?=?0.005), and be admitted to the State Adult Major Trauma Unit (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1?8.3, P?<?0.001). Forty-two (19.7%) of 213 patients had injuries suspected to be caused by an alcohol-affected third party. The ED length of stay and admission rate were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions 15.2% of patient presentations over the study week were alcohol-related. These patients were more likely to present with injury; one in five having injuries suspected to be caused by a third party affected by alcohol. This is a significant public health problem.

AB  - Abstract Crisis intervention services are now widely recognized as an efficacious treatment modality for the provision of emergency mental health care to individuals and groups. During the course of a lifetime, all people experience a variety of personal traumas, such as divorce or illness, while many others will also live through cataclysmic events, such as natural disasters or acts of violence, that result in a state of crisis. Although exposure to traumatic stressors can trigger adverse, long-term effects that can become extremely difficult to resolve without the timely delivery of effective, psychological intervention, crisis states can also provide an avenue for personal growth. This chapter presents a summary of the historical highlights and the theoretical influences on the development of modem crisis intervention theory. An overview of solution focused therapy, cognitive therapy, and other useful techniques are presented along with the differences and similarities in the delivery of emergency mental health services to individuals and groups. Case examples are used to illustrate the implementation of specific assessments and interventions in providing crisis intervention services. A general framework for collaborating with law enforcement and other agencies providing emergency care providers is presented. Cultural considerations in the context of a crisis, current research, and relevant legal issues are reviewed.

AB  - Abstract This is the continuation of an article that presents a generic four-quadrant ground map for working with conflict. Four key tasks of conflict transformation and proactive peacebuilding are explored: Q1.?Personal resources Q2.?Interpersonal and intercultural issues Q3.?Bio-psycho-social determinants Q4.?Organizational and systemic dimensions Quadrant 1, which maps personal resources, and Quadrant 2, which deals with the interpersonal and intercultural dimensions of conflict, were covered in the previous issue of this journal. In this issue I present the remaining two quadrants of the ground map: Quadrant 3, which addresses bio-psycho-social determinants of conflict, and Quadrant 4, which covers the systemic and organizational dimensions of conflict. This concludes the first conceptual part of this four-quadrant framework for understanding and working with conflict. In Part Two of this framework this conceptual ground map is applied to generate four practical steps towards transforming conflict on the road to peace: Step 1.?Diagnosis: what is going on here ? both good and bad? Step 2.?Prognosis: what are the options for change? Step 3.?'Treatment': what are the real-time possibilities for change? Step 4.?Maintenance: what will be needed to maintain these gains (stability under stress)? Part Three of this four-quadrant framework sets out common topics in a curriculum for peace work that addresses the theory and practice of conflict transformation by peaceful means. This includes: 1. Understanding root causes of conflict and other conflict contributing factors. 2. Theoretical approaches to understanding violence: structural, cultural and direct violence. 3. Mapping conflict positions, interests, needs, attitudes and behaviours of the actors, stakeholders and ?conflict entrepreneurs? involved in the conflict. 4. ?Multi-track diplomacy?, conflict settlement, management, and sustainable reintegration of conflict actors, (re)construction of infrastructure and sustainable development through institution building and wealth creation. I conclude by outlining four essential qualities for peace builders: The capacity to: 1 witness pain, distress and suffering. 2 hear complaints made by either party, connect emotionally with their pain and offer listening and understanding in a compassionate and intelligent way. 3 target those peacebuilding interventions that have the greatest leverage. 4 implement coherent partnership working across all four conflict quadrants. In the Appendix I introduce the recent international initiative for creating ministries or departments for peace in government. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Abstract Background? Fecal incontinence (FI) is a major part of illness and physical discomfort in the general population. Since the 1990s, sacral nerve stimulation has been well established in the treatment of neurogenic FI. The precise placement of the electrode is crucial for the success of the procedure. Eighty percent of the patients benefit from permanent treatment, but in 10?20% of the patients tested electrode placement proves impossible due to anatomical variations of the sacral foramina. In this study, we describe the technical requirements and a new method of electrode placement with reference to the anatomical (bone) landmarks in an animal model. Methods? With a small endoscope (Verres needle), we accessed the perirectal space to identify the nervous structures. A stimulated sphincter EMG was obtained for the experimental animals and muscle action potential (MAP/M-wave), latency time [ms], and the amplitude of the motor response [?V] were recorded. Electrodes were placed, the animals killed and dissected leaving the pelvic cavity untouched. The specimens were examined in a magnetic resonance scanner and in a multi-slice computed tomography scanner to detect the electrode material and possible surgical complications. After that the specimens were dissected. Key Results? In all eight cases in the four animals tested, we were able to stimulate the sacral nerve as demonstrated by the EMG findings. No major surgical complications were observed for the procedure. Conclusions & Inferences? Endoscopic sacral nerve root stimulation is a safe and effective method for delivering stimulation material in the pelvis of the sheep. It is a promising procedure to be tested in humans.

AB  - Summary Evidence for Iron Age funerary treatments remains sporadic across Britain and formal cemeteries are especially elusive. One important exception is Broxmouth hillfort, East Lothian, excavated during the late 1970s but not yet published. New analysis of the human remains from Broxmouth provides evidence for three distinct populations: a formal cemetery outside the hillfort, isolated graves within the ramparts, and a scatter of disarticulated fragments from a range of domestic and midden contexts. The latter group in particular provides significant evidence for violent trauma; isotopic evidence suggests that they may be the remains of outsiders. Together the human remains shed light on complex and changing attitudes to death and the human body in Iron Age Britain. The material from Broxmouth is considered in the light of emerging evidence for fluid and pluralistic treatments of the dead in the Iron Age of south-east Scotland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5?percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3?percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate robotic dry laboratory (dry lab) exercises in terms of their face, content, construct and concurrent validities. To evaluate the applicability of the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool to assess dry lab performance. Materials and Methods Participants were prospectively categorized into two groups: robotic novice (no cases as primary surgeon) and robotic expert (≥30 cases). Participants completed three virtual reality (VR) exercises using the da Vinci Skills Simulator (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), as well as corresponding dry lab versions of each exercise (Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) on the da Vinci Surgical System. Simulator performance was assessed by metrics measured on the simulator. Dry lab performance was blindly video-evaluated by expert review using the six-metric GEARS tool. Participants completed a post-study questionnaire (to evaluate face and content validity). A Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to compare performance between groups (construct validity) and Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess simulation to dry lab performance (concurrent validity). Results The mean number of robotic cases experienced for novices was 0 and for experts the mean (range) was 200 (30?2000) cases. Expert surgeons found the dry lab exercises both ?realistic? (median [range] score 8 [4?10] out of 10) and ?very useful? for training of residents (median [range] score 9 [5?10] out of 10). Overall, expert surgeons completed all dry lab tasks more efficiently (P < 0.001) and effectively (GEARS total score P < 0.001) than novices. In addition, experts outperformed novices in each individual GEARS metric (P < 0.001). Finally, in comparing dry lab with simulator performance, there was a moderate correlation overall (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Most simulator metrics correlated moderately to strongly with corresponding GEARS metrics (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions The robotic dry lab exercises in the present study have face, content, construct and concurrent validity with the corresponding VR tasks. Until now, the assessment of dry lab exercises has been limited to basic metrics (i.e. time to completion and error avoidance). For the first time, we have shown it is feasibile to apply a global assessment tool (GEARS) to dry lab training.

AB  - ABSTRACT Alteration of deep cartilage matrix has been observed following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, evidenced by elevated MRI UTE-T2* values measured in small, 2-D cartilage regions of interest. This Level I diagnostic study seeks to more thoroughly evaluate deep cartilage matrix changes to medial tibiofemoral UTE-T2* maps 2 years after ACL reconstruction and examine the relative utilities of 3-D compared to 2-D assessments of cartilage UTE-T2* maps. Thirty-eight ACL-reconstructed and 20 uninjured subjects underwent MRI UTE-T2* mapping. ?Small? single mid-sagittal 2-D and larger 3-D ?tread mark? regions of interest were manually segmented and found to be correlated in medial cartilage (r?>?0.58, p?<?0.005). 3-D analyses of UTE-T2* maps showed differences to medial tibial cartilage between ACL-reconstructed and uninjured subjects (p?=?0.007) that were not detected by smaller 2-D regions (p?>?0.46). Quantitative comparisons show 14/38 (37%) ACL-reconstructed subjects have values >2 standard deviations higher than uninjured controls. Among a subset of ACL-reconstructed subjects with no morphologic MRI evidence of medial tibiofemoral cartilage or meniscal pathology (n?=?12), elevated UTE-T2* values in ?small? 2-D femoral (p?=?0.011), but not larger 3-D tread mark regions of interest (p?>?0.13), were observed. These data show the utility of 2-D UTE-T2* assessments of mid-sagittal weight-bearing regions of medial femoral cartilage for identifying subclinical deep cartilage matrix changes 2 years after ACLR. Clinical Significance: Mid-sagittal single slice 2-D UTE-T2* mapping may be an efficient means to assess medial femoral cartilage for subsurface matrix changes early after ACL reconstruction while 3-D assessments provide additional sensitivity to changes in the medial tibial plateau. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The human interosseous membrane (IOM) is a fundamental stabilizer during forearm rotation. To investigate the dynamic aspects of forearm stability, we analyzed sensory nerve endings in the IOM. The distal oblique bundle (DOB), the distal accessory band (DAB), the central band (CB), the proximal accessory band (PAB), the dorsal oblique accessory cord (DOAC) and the proximal oblique cord (POC) were dissected from 11 human cadaver forearms. Sensory nerve endings were analyzed at two levels per specimen as total cell amount/mm2 after immunofluorescence staining with low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5, S-100 protein and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole on an Apotome microscope, according to Freeman and Wyke?s classification. Sensory nerve endings were significantly more commonly found to be equally distributed throughout the structures, rather than being epifascicular, interstitial, or close to the insertion into bone (P ≤ 0.001, respectively). Free nerve endings were the predominant mechanoreceptor in all six structures, with highest density in the DOB, followed by the POC (P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). The DOB had the highest density of Pacini corpuscles. The DOAC and CB had the lowest amounts of sensory innervation. The high density of sensory corpuscles in the DOB, PAB and POC indicate that proprioceptive control of the compressive and directional muscular forces acting on the distal and proximal radioulnar joints is monitored by the DOB, PAB and POC, respectively, due to their closed proximity to both joints, whereas the central parts of the IOM act as structures of passive restraint.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of applying chitosan membrane (ChiMe) on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (NS-RARP). The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data. Patients and Methods This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated. Results In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. Conclusion In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the ?standard? procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study. The present paper was performed before Conformité Européene (CE)-mark achievement.

AB  - Abstract Objective Prognostic models are commonly used in the clinical setting. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the Rapid Emergency Medical Score (REMS) or alternate models. Methods A retrospective cohort study of critical care patients who underwent retrieval service transfer to an ICU in a single state-wide service in Victoria, Australia. All patients aged 18 years and over transferred to an ICU between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013. Retrieval and ICU datasets were probabilistically linked. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the capacity of physiological markers and patient characteristics to predict in-hospital mortality in the ICU population. The prediction performance was evaluated using measures of discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (Hosmer?Lemeshow [H-L statistic]?). Results There were 1776 ICU patients who were transferred and 1749 (98.5%) had complete data. Of the 1749 patients with complete data, 257 (14.7%) died in-hospital. The REMS calculated at the time of retrieval referral demonstrated borderline predictive capability (C-statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.62?0.76). Following logistic regression analysis of the REMS components, final variables included in the Retrieval REMS model were age, mean arterial pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale score. This model demonstrated acceptable predictive capability (C-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.64?0.79). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) Retrieval REMS for survivors and non-survivors, respectively, were 7 (5, 10) and 9 (7, 11), P < 0.01. Conclusions The availability of a validated tool such as Retrieval REMS assists recognition of high-risk patients and consideration of this risk in retrieval mission planning and response.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive breakdown of striatal neurons. Standard white matter integrity measures like fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging were analyzed in prodromal-HD subjects; however, they studied either a whole brain or specific subcortical white matter structures with connections to cortical motor areas. In this work, we propose a novel analysis of a longitudinal cohort of 243 prodromal-HD individuals and 88 healthy controls who underwent two or more diffusion MRI scans as part of the PREDICT-HD study. We separately trace specific white matter fiber tracts connecting the striatum (caudate and putamen) with four cortical regions corresponding to the hand, face, trunk, and leg motor areas. A multi-tensor tractography algorithm with an isotropic volume fraction compartment allows estimating diffusion of fast-moving extra-cellular water in regions containing crossing fibers and provides quantification of a microstructural property related to tissue atrophy. The tissue atrophy rate is separately analyzed in eight cortico-striatal pathways as a function of CAG-repeats (genetic load) by statistically regressing out age effect from our cohort. The results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in isotropic volume fraction (atrophy) bilaterally in hand fiber connections to the putamen with increasing CAG-repeats, which connects the genetic abnormality (CAG-repeats) to an imaging-based microstructural marker of tissue integrity in specific white matter pathways in HD. Isotropic volume fraction measures in eight cortico-striatal pathways are also correlated significantly with total motor scores and diagnostic confidence levels, providing evidence of their relevance to HD clinical presentation.

AB  - Abstract A new low-profile ?balloon-on-a-wire? angioplasty catheter, the Probe? (USCI), was used in 107 patients over a 4-month period. Twenty-nine patients had stable angina, 59 had unstable angina, and 19 had had myocardial infarction (Ml) 3 to 15 days prior to the procedure; 71 patients had single-vessel and 36 had multi-vessel disease. In this series, 57 lesions were defined as complex. Successful dilatation was defined as a residual stenosis of <30%. Of 132 non-total obstructions, 127 (97%) were successfully dilated. Two distal lesions could not be reached, two lesions could not be crossed by the balloon, and a distal lesion dilatation resulted in acute closure in one case. Of 19 total obstructions, 16 (84%) were successfully dilated (mean residual stenosis 23%). The wire tip was unable to cross the lesion in the three unsuccessful procedures. Seven complications occurred in the series, all involving non-total obstructions: closure of a distal vessel and a side branch caused no clinical symptoms or EKG changes; three local dissections were tacked back with repeat dilatation; and two longitudinal dissections caused no apparent reduction in luminal diameter. The Probe's low-profile and exceptional trackability enabled it to cross very tight lesions with minimal trauma to the vessel wall. The high degree of conformability of the PET balloon minimizes vessel straightening or sheer forces and appears to reduce the potential for dissection. The device may therefore extend the indications and ease of PTCA while reducing complications of the procedure.
