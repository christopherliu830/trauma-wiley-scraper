AB  - Abstract The pass rate in the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Fellowship exams between 1996 and 2003 inclusive averaged 61%, substantially lower than that of other specialties with comparable training structures. The explanation for this pass rate, which many would judge as unacceptably low, is likely to be multi-factorial. Possible factors that should be considered include trainee selection, training programme structure, the impact of the Director of Emergency Medicine Training, examination preparation, examination validity and examination reliability. Each of these potential factors needs to be addressed in a systematic fashion in the context of inevitable and increasing internal and external scrutiny of the outcomes of our training programme.

AB  - Background Recent studies have demonstrated that even survivors of mild stroke experience residual damage, which persists and in fact increases in subsequent years. About 45% of stroke victims remain with different levels of disability. Identifying factors associated with poststroke cognitive and neurological decline could potentially yield more effective therapeutic opportunities. Aims and hypothesis We hypothesize that data based on biochemical, neuroimaging, genetic and psychological measures can, in aggregate, serve as better predictors for subsequent disability, cognitive and neurological deterioration, and suggest possible interventions. Design The Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort (TABASCO) study is an ongoing, prospective cohort study that will recruit approximately 1125 consecutive first-ever mild?moderate stroke patients. It is designed to evaluate the association between predefined demographic, psychological, inflammatory, biochemical, neuroimaging and genetic markers, measured during the acute phase, and long-term outcome: subsequent cognitive deterioration, vascular events (including recurrent strokes), falls, affect changes, functional everyday difficulties and mortality. Discussion This study is an attempt to comprehensively investigate the long-term outcome of mild?moderate strokes. Its prospective design will provide quantitative data on stroke recurrence, the incidence of other vascular events and the evaluation of cognitive, affective and functional decline. Identifying the factors associated with poststroke cognitive and functional decline could potentially yield more effective therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Background:? Muscle disuse atrophy is observed in patients recovering from trauma and there is an increased risk and severity of injury in patients abusing alcohol (EtOH). However, the interaction of EtOH and disuse on muscle protein balance has not been examined. Therefore, the present study addressed the hypothesis that EtOH accelerates the disuse atrophy and/or impairs the accretion of muscle protein during muscle recovery. Methods:? To address this aim, disuse atrophy was induced in rats by 3?days of unilateral hindlimb immobilization (casting), using the contralateral leg as control, with EtOH or saline being orally gavaged twice, each day during this period. In a separate study, EtOH-treated rats received Velcade to inhibit proteasomal degradation. Finally, in the last study, rats had 1 limb casted for 5?days, the cast removed, and EtOH or saline gavaged twice daily during a 5-day recovery period. Muscle protein metabolism was assessed using surrogate markers of protein synthesis [i.e., phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (BP1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)] and protein degradation (i.e., mRNA content of the ubiquitin E3 ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1). Results:? Ethanol alone did not decrease muscle weight in the uncasted muscle. However, the loss of mass of immobilized muscle from EtOH-gavaged rats was 80% greater than in the animals not receiving EtOH. This atrophic response was not associated with a change in Akt, 4E-BP1 or S6K1 phosphorylation among groups. In contrast, immobilization alone increased both atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA, and EtOH further increased their expression in immobilized muscle. The proteasome inhibitor Velcade attenuated atrophy produced by EtOH?+?disuse. When administered during the recovery period, EtOH prevented the normal accretion of muscle mass. This EtOH effect was associated with increased atrogin-1 mRNA, a reduction in 4E-BP1 and S6 phosphorylation, and an increased AMP-activated kinase phosphorylation. Conclusions:? Based on the changes in these surrogate markers, our data suggest that EtOH accelerates disuse atrophy by stimulating ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and blunts repletion of muscle protein during recovery from disuse by increasing proteolysis and decreasing protein synthesis.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the aesthetics of implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla using objective indices and patients' perception. Methods: Fifty participants, former patients (mean age 31.3 years) at the Dental Hospital, University of Bergen, or at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, who had implant-supported single crowns replacing upper anterior teeth lost due to trauma or agenesis during 2006, were included. One year after placement of the crown, an evaluation was carried out using the Pink Aesthetic Score (PES), the Implant Crown Aesthetics Index (ICAI), a modified version of the ICAI (mod-ICAI), and the index of the Californian Dental Association (CDA). The participants rated their satisfaction with the crowns and adjacent soft tissue. Results: The form of the crown was satisfactory for 88% and the colour for 84% of participants, while 72% were satisfied with the adjacent mucosa. A statistically significant bivariate correlation was found between the PES and the ICAI and mod-ICAI. A weaker association was found between the CDA and the ICAI, mod-ICAI and PES. A positive correlation was found between the mod-ICAI index and satisfaction with the form and colour of the crowns and with the sum of ratings of responses to the questions about the form and colour of the crowns and the form and colour of the adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Although most participants were satisfied, objective evaluation showed that a good aesthetic outcome for single implants was related to the quantity of the peri-implant mucosa. Conclusion: The mod-ICAI index correlated with responses to questions about the form and colour of the mucosa. Other significant correlations were found between the participants' aesthetic perceptions and the ICAI and the mod-ICAI. The mod-ICAI combined best objective and subjective assessment of aesthetics related to implant-supported crowns. To cite this article: ?Vilhjálmsson VH, Klock KS, St?rksen K, Bårdsen A.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The quantification of spinal cord (SC) atrophy by MRI has assumed an important role in assessment of neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic SC injury. Recent technical advances make possible the quantification of gray matter (GM) and white matter tissues in clinical settings. However, the goal of a reliable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive marker is still elusive, in part due to large intersubject variability of SC areas. Here, we investigated the sources of this variability and explored effective strategies to reduce it. METHODS One hundred twenty-nine healthy subjects (mean age: 41.0 ± 15.9) underwent MRI on a Siemens 3T Skyra scanner. Two-dimensional PSIR at the C2-C3 vertebral level and a sagittal 1 mm3 3D T1-weighted brain acquisition extended to the upper cervical cord were acquired. Total cross-sectional area and GM area were measured at C2-C3, as well as measures of the vertebra, spinal canal and the skull. Correlations between the different metrics were explored using Pearson product-moment coefficients. The most promising metrics were used to normalize cord areas using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS The most effective normalization metrics were the V-scale (from SienaX) and the product of the C2-C3 spinal canal diameters. Normalization methods based on these metrics reduced the intersubject variability of cord areas of up to 17.74%. The measured cord areas had a statistically significant sex difference, while the effect of age was moderate. CONCLUSIONS The present work explored in a large cohort of healthy subjects the source of intersubject variability of SC areas and proposes effective normalization methods for its reduction.

AB  - Summary The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This cheap, easy approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures. Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable in the patient at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt a ?wait and see? policy, only intervening when clinical deterioration is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure.

AB  - ABSTRACT The community framework this volume champions is a fruitful addition for anthropological bioarchaeologists seeking to understand ancient population dynamics. The breadth illustrates the importance of the concept of community, the difficulty of moving beyond definitions restricted by geography, and particular challenges of bioarchaeological datasets. Population- and spatially-based analyses are critical and generally most appropriate in our discipline; yet, they can inadvertently present pictures of homogeneity that do not accurately characterize the ancient communities we study. We must continue to seek productive ways to appreciate diversity within the ancient communities though contextually based and ?multi-subdisciplinary? approaches. We continue asking in what way the patterns in mortuary and other bioarchaeological variables are culturally meaningful from real or ideal culture perspectives, seeking to move beyond geographically bound approaches.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 ± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19±12% and ? 23±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

AB  - Summary Background Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor-based techniques are becoming more popular in horses as a tool for objective locomotor assessment. Objectives To describe, evaluate and validate a method of stride detection and quantification at walk and trot using distal limb mounted IMU sensors. Study design Prospective validation study comparing IMU sensors and motion capture with force plate data. Methods A total of seven Warmblood horses equipped with metacarpal/metatarsal IMU sensors and reflective markers for motion capture were hand walked and trotted over a force plate. Using four custom built algorithms hoof-on/hoof-off timing over the force plate were calculated for each trial from the IMU data. Accuracy of the computed parameters was calculated as the mean difference in milliseconds between the IMU or motion capture generated data and the data from the force plate, precision as the s.d. of these differences and percentage of error with accuracy of the calculated parameter as a percentage of the force plate stance duration. Results Accuracy, precision and percentage of error of the best performing IMU algorithm for stance duration at walk were 28.5, 31.6 ms and 3.7% for the forelimbs and ?5.5, 20.1 ms and ?0.8% for the hindlimbs, respectively. At trot the best performing algorithm achieved accuracy, precision and percentage of error of ?27.6/8.8 ms/?8.4% for the forelimbs and 6.3/33.5 ms/9.1% for the hindlimbs. Main limitations The described algorithms have not been assessed on different surfaces. Conclusions Inertial measurement unit technology can be used to determine temporal kinematic stride variables at walk and trot justifying its use in gait and performance analysis. However, precision of the method may not be sufficient to detect all possible lameness-related changes. These data seem promising enough to warrant further research to evaluate whether this approach will be useful for appraising the majority of clinically relevant gait changes encountered in practice.

AB  - Although river water was vital to the textile industry and agrarian economy, Italian city-states suffered catastrophic flooding during the sixteenth century. We know this since these natural disasters are well documented in chronicles and diaries, and preserved by flood markers on buildings throughout Florence and Rome. The Arno bisects Florence, which I argue commemorated frequent floods and inundations in one of the Medici's grottos, Bernardo Buontalenti's Grotta grande (1582?93), built inside the Boboli garden. In Part I of this article, I examine the Arno's relationship to Florence, its perennial flooding, and the Medici's stewardship of water in the city. The article then offers specific reasons that the Grotta grande signifies crisis: the presence of deluge and rain grottos across Italy, Filippo Baldinucci's biography of Buontalenti in the Notizie de? Professori del Disegno (1681), and Francesco Bocchi's treatment of this space and others in his 1591 guidebook, Le bellezze della citta di Fiorenza. Ultimately I argue that Grotta grande was an artistic coping strategy for the trauma we associate with severe natural disaster, and that it memorializes the fragility of human affairs in light of the colossal forces of nature in Florence, a city obsessed with art and legacy.

AB  - Background and Objectives This study challenges the currently accepted treatment parameters of waiting 1 year following burn injury to treat the resultant scarring. It assesses the impact of treating burn and trauma wounds at less than 3 months of injury on scar formation, providing a new temporal paradigm to patients in the prevention and minimization of scar formation. Study Design/Materials and Methods This randomized clinical trial included 19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute burn injuries less than 3 months from injury. The treatment areas underwent three fractional ablative CO2 laser treatments at 8-week intervals. The primary outcomes were improvement in the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and photography. Secondary outcomes were optical coherence tomography (OCT), treatment time, immediate post-treatment response, and histology. Results Upon blinded evaluation, 100% of treatment areas were correctly identified when compared with control. MSS scores before and after treatment were totaled with an averaged sum of 13.33 per scar at baseline to 8.39 after treatment, a 63% average improvement versus control (P?<?0.001). Histology and OCT demonstrated a re-organization of the underlying skin structure. The average treatment time was 18?minutes. Immediate post-treatment responses were limited to mild-to-moderate erythema. Conclusions Early intervention with ablative fractional laser on acute traumatic wounds resulted in significant decrease of scar formation compared with untreated areas on the same wounds, providing an impactful new time course to treat severe burn and trauma injuries.

AB  - Summary Iron is of key importance for aerobic metabolism, and natural feeds of the horse are fairly rich sources of iron. Accordingly, the known incidence of iron deficiency anaemia is apparently rare in performance horses; despite this, iron deficiency in performance horses continues to be of concern to trainers and veterinarians. Effects of exercise on plasma ferritin concentrations were therefore studied in Standardbreds, Finnhorses and half-bred riding horses. Blood samples were taken after a moderate exercise test on a racetrack, a competition exercise test on a treadmill and a race. Even moderate exercise caused an increase in plasma ferritin concentration, with the increase being greater as the intensity and duration of exercise increased. Return to the basal level was slower after maximal-intensity exercise than after moderate exercise. In conclusion, although ferritin is a useful marker of low iron stores, samples should be taken only after at least 2 days rest following strenuous exercise.

AB  - Abstract Climate change is expected to lead to greater extremes (droughts and floods) in river regimes around the world. While the number of major calamities is predicted to rise, the efforts of the public sector, experts and local stakeholders are badly coordinated. Consequently, aid does not reach target groups, resulting in unnecessary losses. Hence, there is a need for more participatory and integrative approaches. To ensure a more concerted response to climate-induced disasters, stakeholders could coordinate and negotiate within Multi-Stakeholder Platforms. Such roundtables are increasingly being established for vision-building and integrated water resource management, but could be employed in disaster management as well. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of participation, this article trace the rise of and the problems facing two ?El Niño? platforms: one in Ica, a city on the Peruvian coast that flooded unexpectedly in January 1998, and one in Ayacucho, which saw a climate change-induced drought around the same time. The issue of internal and external legitimacy receives particular emphasis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes after radical mandibulectomy in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Eight cats were included. Methods Medical records were searched for cats with confirmed oral neoplasia treated with radical mandibulectomy. Data collected included demographics, surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative management, and outcomes. Results Ages ranged from 8 to 17?years. All cats had 75% to 90% of the mandible removed and feeding tubes placed. Seven cats had squamous cell carcinoma, and one cat had a giant cell tumor. Six cats ate on their own postoperatively. Three cats had local recurrence and tumor-related died at 136 and 291?days. Six cats had no recurrence, with survival times of 156, 465, 608, and 1023?days, and two cats were still alive at 316 and 461 days after surgery. The three long-term survivors died of causes unrelated to oral neoplasia. One cat died at 156?days due to aspiration of food material. The overall estimated mean survival time was 712 days. Conclusion After radical mandibulectomy, independent food intake was achieved in 6 of eight cats, and four cats lived longer than one year. Clinical significance: Radical mandibulectomy should be considered for the treatment of extensive oral neoplasia in cats. Successful long-term outcomes are possible with aggressive supportive care perioperatively.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we consider the health and social impacts of the flooding caused to a number of Carlisle households following the January 2005 floods and storms. In so doing we consider such impacts from a ?lived, local experience? perspective. We reflect on the need for both informal support and locally accessible and ongoing, post-flood information and support centres. Such centres can provide one point of contact for potentially multiple, emotional and practical problems. Crucially we suggest that these centres require both strong multipartnership and multi-agency working and highly skilled support centre personnel who have local knowledge and understanding of the affected community. In this way, postdisaster local needs may be contextualized and responded to in a way that both draws on existing local knowledge and expertise and further strengthens long-term community-based support.

AB  - While current donor selection with clinical findings is generally effective, the imprecise nature of the assessment forces clinicians to remain on the conservative side. A reliable biological marker would assist donor selection and would improve donor organ utilization. We collected biopsies from 169 donor lungs before implantation. Expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-? and IL-1? were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Seventeen cases died within 30 days after transplantation. No donor factor was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Univariate analysis of the 84 cases for development of the prediction model showed that IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1? were risk factors for mortality and IL-10 and IFN-? were protective factors. We analyzed the cytokine expression ratios of risk to protective cytokines. A stepwise logistic regression for 30-day mortality demonstrated that a model containing the ratio of IL-6/IL-10 was the most predictive (p = 0.0013). When applied to the remaining 85 cases for validation, the test of model fit was significant (p = 0.039). Using the cytokine ratio, we were able to define three risk groups with striking differences in survival (p = 0.0003). Multi-cytokine analysis of the donor lung graft with qRT-PCR shows significant promise as a strategy to biologically evaluate the donor lung prior to implantation.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) uses x-ray beams and reconstructive computer technology to create tomographic slices (sections) of the area being imaged. Computed tomography has higher contrast resolution than conventional radiography allowing for more accurate differentiation of soft tissues and fluids. This form of 3D imaging removes problems caused by superimposition of multiple anatomical structures, which is a major impediment when viewing radiographs of the equine head. Once the images are acquired, multi-planar and 3D reconstructions can be performed to view different teeth or associated structures in an optimal way. Anatomical and pathological changes in the dental tissues, periodontal tissues, alveolar bone and adjacent sinuses can then be assessed. Scintigraphy with 99m technetium methyl-diphosphate (methylene-diphosphonate) can detect changes in bone that precede radiographic changes, and this makes it a very useful imaging modality for diagnosis of early periapical infection of the equine cheek teeth. Additionally, it is invaluable for imaging suspected infections of supernumerary or dysplastic teeth where the results of radiography or even CT may be equivocal. Periapical infections of the cheek teeth typically result in focal and intense increased radionuclide uptake located over the apical region of the affected tooth.

AB  - ABSTRACT Fracture healing is a regenerative process that involves coordinated responses of many cell types, but characterization of the roles of specific cell populations in this process has been limited. We have identified alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) as a marker of a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells in the periosteum that contributes to osteochondral elements during fracture healing. Using a lineage tracing approach, we labeled αSMA-expressing cells, and characterized changes in the periosteal population during the early stages of fracture healing by histology, flow cytometry, and gene expression profiling. In response to fracture, the αSMA-labeled population expanded and began to differentiate toward the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. The frequency of mesenchymal progenitor cell markers such as Sca1 and PDGFRα increased after fracture. By 6 days after fracture, genes involved in matrix production and remodeling were elevated. In contrast, genes associated with muscle contraction and Notch signaling were downregulated after fracture. We confirmed that activating Notch signaling in αSMA-labeled cells inhibited differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo. By characterizing changes in a selected αSMA-labeled progenitor cell population during fracture callus formation, we have shown that modulation of Notch signaling may determine osteogenic potential of αSMA-expressing progenitor cells during bone healing. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study The suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx (SADP) is functionally and clinically important. Objectives To investigate SADP form and function and the microanatomy of its insertion zone. Study design Descriptive gross and microanatomy. Methods The feet of 6 normal Standardbred horses were sectioned into blocks along the traditional perpendicular transverse axis and along functional axes of the SADP, decalcified and processed for staining with haematoxylin and eosin, Jones' periodic acid silver methenamine or Masson's trichrome stains. Results In traditional midline toe transverse plane sections SADP collagen bundles were irregular with an unstructured appearance. In sections made transversely along planes (70° and 30°) aligned with the long axis of the SADP, collagen bundles were arranged in linear rows. The linear bundles were continuous from their origin on parietal ridges of the distal phalanx through to the secondary epidermal lamellar basement membrane. At the parietal ridge interface the collagen bundles coalesced into smaller, strongly silver staining, linear structures that penetrated the cortical bone and merged with adjacent osteons. In proximal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also linear, angled at 70° to the ground surface. In distal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also arranged linearly but in a multi-angled, ?spokes of a wheel? arrangement, centred on the distal phalanx apex. Conclusions Sectioning along functional axes demonstrated the true suspensory nature of the SADP connecting the parietal surface to the lamellar hoof wall. SADP/distal phalanx insertions showed penetrating fibres extending through the chondral?apophyseal interface up to and between distal phalanx osteons. Lamellar measurements made from sections perpendicular to the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx are underestimations but if made along the longer, functional midline 70° transverse plane would accurately reflect the suspensory function of the lamellae. Laminitis pathophysiology correctly viewed as SADP degradation should inform logical, future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Summary Background Upper respiratory tract (URT) endoscopic examination is a routine part of prepurchase examinations. Discrepancies have been documented in the assessment of arytenoid function grades (AFG) between veterinarians. Objectives To document intra- and interobserver agreement for a population of multi-experience level veterinarians for assessment of AFG of 2-year-old Thoroughbreds. Study design Observational cohort study. Methods One-hundred and fourteen URT videoendoscopic examinations were evaluated by 10 veterinarians. Veterinarians were categorised based on experience, into five groups, each group with two veterinarians. Arytenoid function was graded using the Havemeyer ordinal scale and then reclassified by the authors dichotomously into ?meets conditions of sale? (MCS) or ?does not meet conditions of sale?(DNMCS). Interobserver agreement of arytenoid function was assessed across all 10 veterinarians using Fleiss? kappa and between veterinarians of similar experience levels in the five subgroups using Cohen's unweighted (k) and Cohen's linear weighted kappa (Ck). Intraobserver agreement was similarly calculated for each reviewer using 22 repeated video clips. Results Overall interobserver agreement using ordinal scales was fair (k = 0.27, 95% CI 0.22?0.31) to moderate (mean weighted Ck = 0.57, 95% CI 0.46?0.69) depending on statistical methodology used. Using the dichotomous classification, interobserver agreement was good (k = 0.7, 95% CI 0.63?0.77). Overall intraobserver agreement using ordinal scales was fair (mean k = 0.26, 95% CI 0.14?0.38) to good (mean Ck = 0.61, 95% CI 0.50?0.71); and for the dichotomous reclassification it was good (k = 0.73, 95% CI 0.59?0.87). Experience level differences were identified. Main limitations The low number of veterinarians in each experience subgroup. Conclusions Subjectivity exists in arytenoid function grading, despite the existence of a well-defined scale. Agreement variation exists depending on the grading scales and statistical methods used for analysis. Future studies pre- and post veterinarian training are indicated to determine if agreement can be improved.
