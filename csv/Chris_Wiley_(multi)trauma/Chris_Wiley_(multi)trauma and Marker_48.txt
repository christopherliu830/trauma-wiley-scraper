AB  - ABSTRACT: Leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma has been repeatedly used as evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in experimental and human studies. However, there is no consensus in the literature concerning this phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined this question by comparing frontal lobe sections in seven groups of patients: Multi-infarct dementia (n= 6), AD with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, age-matched controls with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, controls with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, and young controls (n= 10). An additional series compared prospectively followed patients with a diagnosis of either multi-infarct dementia (n= 5) or AD (n= 4). Albumin was detected in white-matter astrocytes in all cases, without significant variation in intensity. In addition, diverse combinations of neurons, astrocytes, and (in AD patients) senile plaques were present in the cerebral cortex in an inconsistent manner. Semiquantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences among groups. Anti-IgG labeled astrocytes in infarcts only. Complement C3c component was detected in rare amyloid plaques in a minority (15%) of AD cases. Selective labeling of AD-specific lesions in a patchy manner was observed for serum amyloid P. We conclude that there is no immunohistochemical evidence of alteration of the BBB in Alzheimer's disease with or without vascular factors or in old age. Serum amyloid P binds avidly to AD lesions, but our findings are consistent with leakage through the BBB during the agonal or immediate postmortem period. Finally, no specific pattern of abnormality in the BBB was detected in multi-infarct dementia.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of intensive and non-intensive formats of delivery of image interpretation education for radiographers. Methods A multi-centre, stratified (by years of experience) two group parallel arm, single blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants (n = 48) were allocated to one of two groups to receive image interpretation education: (1) intensive format (13.5 h over two consecutive days) (2) non-intensive (sequential 90-min tutorials delivered 1 week apart). Participants undertook x-ray interpretation tests before education, at 1-week post-education completion and at 12-week post-education completion. Results Image interpretation performance was not significantly different between groups at baseline. A generalised linear model indicated that participants who received intensive education format improved image interpretation performance by a greater margin than the group that received non-intensive education at 1-week (P = 0.002) and 12-week (P < 0.001) follow-up assessments. Conclusions Although both formats of education delivery may be beneficial, the findings of this study have indicated that the intensive format of delivery was more effective at improving radiographers? ability to interpret trauma radiographs in the weeks after completion of the image interpretation program.

AB  - In the context of relationship trauma, partners' reactive patterns of engagement can disrupt and derail attempts at relationship correction and healing. A circumplex typology of couple patterns of engagement in relational trauma context is defined in terms of partners' underlying views of self in relation to other (VSIRO). VSIRO is conceptualized along a continuum anchored at opposite poles by inflated (self-aggrandizing) versus collapsed (self-abnegating) VSIRO, with a balanced (egalitarian) VSIRO, characterized by accountability and forbearance, as the target position. The circumplex model delineates four problematic couple configurations?a dejected couple, a taker?enabler couple, an ultimate fighting couple, and a debtor?collector couple. Where problematic engagement occurs, therapists need to reshape couple engagement toward the balanced, egalitarian position prior to relational trauma work. Clinical vignettes depict these couples and springboard an analysis of unique needs and interventions associated with each couple configuration. Reshaping couple patterns of engagement using a circumplex model of couple configurations is an essential prerequisite to effective and ethical relational trauma work.

AB  - Abstract We hypothesise that following a bone fracture there is systemic recruitment of bone forming cells to a fracture site. A rabbit ulnar osteotomy model was adapted to trace the movement of osteogenic cells. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 41 NZW rabbits were isolated, culture-expanded and fluorescently labelled. The labelled cells were either re-implanted into the fracture gap (Group A); into a vein (Group B); or into a remote tibial bone marrow cavity 48 h after the osteotomy (Group C) or 4 weeks before the osteotomy was established (Group D), and a control group (Group E) had no labelled cells given. To quantify passive leakage of cells to an injury site, inert beads were also co-delivered in Group B. Samples of the fracture callus tissue and various organs were harvested at discrete sacrifice time-points to trace and quantify the labelled cells. At 3 weeks following osteotomy, the number of labelled cells identified in the callus of Group C, was significantly greater than following IV delivery, Group B, and there was no difference in the number of labelled cells in the callus tissues, between Groups C and A, indicating the labelled bone marrow cells were capable of migrating to the fracture sites from the remote bone marrow cavity. Significantly fewer inert beads than labelled cells were identified in Group B callus, suggesting some of the bone-forming cells were actively recruited and selectively chosen to the fracture site, rather than passively leaked into the circulation and to bone injury site. This investigation supports the hypothesis that some osteoblasts involved in fracture healing were systemically mobilised and recruited to the fracture from remote bone marrow sites. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Objective? The aim of this paper was to analyse the results of treatment of anal fistulas retrospectively. Methods? Between 1992 and 2004, 407 patients were operated on for perianal fistula. In the follow-up period, 107 patients were lost, so 300 patients were analysed in the study. The mean follow-up time was 4.2?years. Analysed parameters included: types of surgical procedures in different kinds of fistulas and postoperative complications. Various types of surgical procedures and their effectiveness were described. Late results were assessed taking into account healing time, duration of sick leave, recurrence rate and incidence of anal sphincter dysfunction. Severity of gas and stool incontinence was assessed according to the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score. Results? In our study, subcutaneous fistula was diagnosed in 23.3%, inter-sphincteric in 18%, trans-sphincteric in 37.7%, supra-sphincteric in 16% and extra-sphincteric in 5% of patients. Single-tract fistulas were present in 88.7% and multi-tract fistulas were present in 11.3%. Overall, 242 patients had primary fistulas and 58 patients had recurrent fistulas. The most frequently performed procedures were cutting seton (139 patients) and radical fistulectomy (104 patients). Recurrent fistulas developed in 14.3%. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence was noticed in 10.7%. The recurrence rate was 5.4% in patients with primary fistula and in 51.7% patients presenting with a recurrent fistula. Gas and stool incontinence developed in 3.7% of patients with primary fistulas and in 39.7% of patients presenting with recurrent fistulas. Recurrence rate was 12% in the patients of single-tract fistulas and 32.4% in the patients of multi-tract fistulas. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence occurred in 8.3% of patients of single-tract fistulas and in 29.4% of patients of multi-tract fistulas. Conclusions? The complication rate was 10-fold higher in patients presenting with a recurrent fistula than in those with primary fistulas and threefold higher in patients with multi-tract fistulas than in those with single-tract fistulas.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Abstract: The authors have retrospectively evaluated the clinical results of mandibular incisors replacement with narrow neck implants (NNI). Thirty-one patients treated consecutively for single or multiple lower incisor replacement with NNI with a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 18?42 months) were included in the study and were divided into three groups: single tooth, multiple unit restoration and restorations on adjacent implants. Survival and success rates and soft tissue parameters such as modified plaque index (mPI), peri-implant probing depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and the papilla index were analyzed. Subjective evaluation was performed by patients and clinicians on visual analogue scales. The implants and prostheses showed a survival rate of 100% and an overall success rate of 94%. The distribution of mPI outcomes showed better results for the single tooth group. BOP was present in four of eight implants (50%) in the adjacent implant group, in one out of 20 implants in the single tooth group (5%) and in one out of 16 implants in the multi unit group (6%). The adjacent implant group showed a statistically significant increase in PPD. The Papilla Index showed a better outcome distribution in single tooth and multi unit groups. Patients' evaluation of treatment outcome was satisfactory in all groups, even though the best esthetic and functional results were found in single tooth and multi unit groups. The professional evaluation showed good outcomes for the single tooth and multi unit groups and statistically significant poorer results in the adjacent implants group. With the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that the replacement of lower incisors with NNI leads to favorable functional and esthetic results in cases of single-tooth or multiple-unit replacement. Worse results are achieved if two adjacent mandibular incisors are replaced with adjacent implants.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.

AB  - Splanchnic ischaemia is thought to be of central importance in the development of multi-organ failure and hence death in critically ill patients. It has been suggested that the arterial to gastric intramucosal pH gradient and the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide between gastric mucosa and arterial blood are more sensitive markers of splanchnic ischaemia than gastric intramucosal pH itself and thus should be predictors of mortality in the critically ill. We studied 62 critically ill patients within 6?h of admission to the intensive care unit and found no significant difference at 0, 12 or 24?h after admission to the study in either the arterial to gastric intramucosal pH gradient or the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide between gastric mucosa and arterial blood between survivors and nonsurvivors. We conclude that in contrast to gastric intramucosal pH neither the arterial to gastric intramucosal pH gradient nor the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide between gastric mucosa and arterial blood distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although long recognized in microvascular research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory markers are present in human diseases. Since the inflammatory cascade serves as a repair mechanism, the presence of inflammatory markers in patient groups has raised an important question about the mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory cascade (i.e., the mechanisms that cause tissue injury). Using a severe form of inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, for which there is no accepted injury mechanism, we summarize studies that suggest that the powerful pancreatic digestive enzymes play a central role in the destruction of the intestine and other tissues if their compartmentalization in the lumen of the intestine and in the pancreas is compromised. Further, we summarize evidence that uncontrolled degrading enzyme activity in plasma causes proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane receptors and loss of associated cell functions. For example, in a model of metabolic disease with type II diabetes, proteolytic cleavage of the insulin receptor causes the inability of insulin to signal glucose transport across membranes. The evidence suggests that uncontrolled proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity may trigger the mechanism for tissue injury. The significance of such mechanisms remain to be explored in human diseases.

AB  - Abstract Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is the most common form of prelingual inherited hearing impairment. A small consanguineous family with this disorder was ascertained through the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences in Madras, India. Conditions such as rubella, prematurity, drug use during pregnancy, perinatal trauma, and meningitis were eliminated by history. Audiometry was performed to confirm severe-to-profound hearing impairment in affected persons. After excluding linkage to known DFNB genes, two genomic DNA pools, one from the affected persons and the other from their non-affected siblings and the parents, were used to screen 165 polymorphic markers evenly spaced across the autosomal human genome. Two regions showing homozygosity-by-descent in the affected siblings were identified on chromosomes 3q21.3-q25.2 and 19p13.3-p13.1, identifying one (or possibly both) as the site of a novel ARNSHL gene.

Background MT can occur in different clinical settings, yet little is known about its epidemiology/clinical outcomes. Methods Data was extracted using transfusion laboratory information management system (LIMS) and patients' electronic databases. Results We identified 701 episodes (incidence 1.7 per 1000 admissions [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6?1.9], belonging to 678 patients (225 females and 453 males, median age 61). Main causes of MT were cardiac surgery (35%), trauma (28%), medical (10%) and vascular surgery (9%). The overall mortality was 32%, and the median number of days spent in hospital was 14 and 2 for those who survived and those who died, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that cardiac surgery was associated with 56% (95% CI: 9?78%) lower odds of death compared to other surgery, and transfusion of 10?14 RBC and >15 RBC units (compared with 5?9 RBC units) were associated with 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4?3.3) and 9.9 (95% CI: 4.6?21.1) times higher odds of dying, respectively. Conclusion In-hospital morbidity and mortality of MT is high. Future research should focus on unifying the definition of MT, and early identification of the MT markers in order to improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background: Augmented reality (AR) allows the surgeon to represent holographic patient-specific anatomical information and surgical instruments in the physical world. To correctly superimpose virtual and physical objects, a hand-eye (HE) calibration method for mapping the virtual and physical spaces was proposed. Methods: Mathematical relationships between the virtual camera and the physical space were derived. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed HE calibration method were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Results: The proposed calibration method allows us to determine an optimal invariant spatiotemporal mapping between the virtual camera and the physical space. Conclusion: Qualitatively and quantitatively reliable and accurate estimates for the physical-virtual mapping transformation were verified. Consequently, imaging data and surgical instruments holograms can be precisely represented in the physical space.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a paucity of population-based studies examining occupational hand-wrist arthritis. We examined relationships between hand-wrist arthritis, occupation, and biomechanical exposures in the U.S. National Health Interview Survey?Occupational Health Supplement. Methods A randomized, multi-stage, and cross-sectional national prevalence survey was carried out. Results Self-reported, medically attended hand-wrist arthritis was common among employed persons (period prevalence 1.58%; lifetime prevalence 3.58%). Highest prevalences occurred among technicians, machine operators, assemblers, and farmers, and in the mining, agriculture, and construction industries. Work requiring repetitive hand bending and twisting was associated with hand-wrist arthritis (Odds Ratio 1.43; 95%CI: 1.11?1.84; P?=?0.005). Among workers with hand arthritis, 7.4% had made major changes in their work, 7.6% missed work, and 4.5% stopped working or changed jobs because of the problem. Conclusions Our study links hand-wrist arthritis to occupation and potentially modifiable workplace ergonomic factors. The spectrum of hand-wrist ?cumulative trauma? disorders may considerably exceed that of soft-tissue injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis, and may include arthritis, a widely prevalent, disabling condition.

AB  - ABSTRACT Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) development is often observed following traumatic knee injuries involving key stabilising structures such as the cruciate ligaments or the menisci. Both biomechanical and biological alterations that follow knee injuries have been implicated in PTOA development, although it has not been possible to differentiate clearly between the two causal factors. This review critically examines the outcomes from pre-clinical lapine and ovine injury models arising in the authors? laboratories and differing in severity of PTOA development and progression. Specifically, we focus on how varying severity of knee injuries influence the subsequent alterations in kinematics, kinetics, and biological outcomes. The immediate impact of injury on the lubrication capacity of the joint is examined in the context of its influence on biomechanical alterations, thus linking the biological changes to abnormal kinematics, leading to a focus on the potential areas for interventions to inhibit or prevent development of the disease. We believe that PTOA results from altered cartilage surface interactions where biological and biomechanical factors intersect, and mitigating acute joint inflammation may be critical to prolonging PTOA development. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Three-dimensional anal endosonography has enabled sagittal and coronal reconstructions of the anal canal to be matched with longitudinal pressure data, to present a combined picture of structure and function. This novel technique has been applied to a group of women with a clinical diagnosis of a third degree tear. Endosonography showed that only 68% of women had ultrasound evidence of sphincter damage. Anal canal anatomy and pressure profile did not differ significantly between those with and those without sphincter damage, but the anterior external anal sphincter and the puborectalis tended to be shorter and the pressures were lower in those with sphincter disruption.

AB  - Abstract Background Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is recommended for post-traumatic stress disorder and emerging evidence indicates that it is effective for people with intellectual disabilities. However, acceptability from the perspectives of clients with intellectual disabilities, their therapists and other key people has not been formally evaluated. This study investigates process issues in the implementation of EMDR from perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two adults with intellectual disabilities and three clinical psychologists who had participated in EMDR as well as a key supporter (NÂ =Â 6) to provide information relating to three cases. The interviews were analysed thematically either directly from the audio recording or from transcripts. Results Five themes were identified: EMDR feels very different; EMDR is a technical process; the need to work with the present; talking is important; cautious optimism. Conclusions Whilst a range of client- and therapist-related factors served as barriers to using EMDR in this small-scale study, such as preferences in working with the present and inexperienced therapists, there was cautious optimism that EMDR may be useful for ?the right person at the right time.?.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ankle fractures are among the most common lower limb fractures. Associations between postoperative radiographic results and clinical outcome have been found, but less is known about the relevant ankle biomechanics. This study analyzed ankle kinematics, radiographic findings, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in patients treated for ankle fractures. The hypothesis was that patients after ankle fracture surgery had less flexion/extension in the ankle compared to healthy subjects and that fracture severity had significant influence on kinematics and patient satisfaction. Thirty-three patients (n?=?33 feet) operated for ankle fractures were recruited. Ankle kinematics were analyzed using the Oxford Foot model, and results were compared with an age-matched healthy control group (11 patients, 20 feet). In addition, patients were divided by fracture (severity) classification and kinematic results were correlated with PROM and radiographic findings. Patients treated for ankle fracture showed lower walking speed (p?<?0.001) when asked to walk in preferred normal speed. When compared at equal speed, significantly less range of motion (ROM) between the hindfoot and tibia in the sagittal plane (flexion/extension) during loading and push-off phases (p?=?0.003 and p?<?0.001) was found in patients after ankle fractures compared to healthy subjects. Lowest ROM and poorest PROM results were found for patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures. There was a significant correlation between ROM (flexion/extension) during the push-off phase and SF-36 physical functioning (r2?=?0.403, p?=?0.027) and SF-36 general health (r2?=?0.473, p?=?0.008). Fracture severity was significantly correlated with flexion/extension ROM in the ankle during both loading and push-off phases (r2?=??0.382, p?=?0.005, and r2?=??0.568, p?<?0.001) and was also significantly correlated with PROM. This study found that patients with ankle fractures had significantly altered ankle kinematics compared to healthy subjects. The poorest results were found among patients with trimalleolar fractures. Weak to strong significant correlations were found between fracture severity, ankle kinematics, and PROM. ? 2019 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?
