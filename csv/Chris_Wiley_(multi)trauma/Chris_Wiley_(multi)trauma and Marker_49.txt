AB  - Abstract Sternal sepsis following median sternotomy is an infrequent yet devastating complication of cardiac surgery, leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital expense, and a high associated morbidity and mortality. The development of sternotomy infection is multi-factorial. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies have pointed to a multitude of clinical and perioperative variables as being causative, with as many other studies presenting evidence to the contrary. This has led to confusion about which clinical variables should be modified so as to minimize the individual patient's risk for developing this severe complication. Other less obvious factors also come into play. Malnutrition, whether overt or subclinical, is not uncommon in cardiac patients. Immune competency is affected by operative trauma, as well as a variety of perioperative factors including underlying nutritional status, transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and anesthesia. This creates a complex milieu for the development of postoperative infection. In this review, the multiple risk factors of median sternotomy infection are studied and treatment options briefly discussed.

AB  - Summary Testicular germ cell tumours have a favourable prognosis if detected early, but are potentially lethal in a subset of patients. Multi-modality treatment is often necessary, thus the preferable time of diagnosis is at the pre-invasive, but unfortunately often asymptomatic precursor stage of carcinoma in situ (CIS). This review describes current possible approaches for the detection of CIS. At present, an open testicular biopsy is the only definitive way of establishing the presence of CIS. The tissue section should be of an adequate size, be properly fixed, and evaluation be supported by at least one solid immunohistochemical marker, for example PLAP, OCT-3/4 or AP-2?. Determination of who should be offered testicular biopsies is based on clinical and ultrasonic examination along with the evaluation of risk factors. A surgical biopsy is an invasive procedure with potential complications, although rare. Therefore, a noninvasive and equally reliable method is needed. Testicular ultrasound is risk-free, painless and at present the only noninvasive method of aid for andrologists when CIS is suspected. The presence of testicular microlithiasis is, in some cases, indicative of pre-malignant changes, especially in males with additional risk factors. Promising results have recently been obtained with a novel noninvasive detection method based on immunocytological AP-2?-staining of CIS cells in semen. This method could be a supporting method in andrology centres where careful follow-up is possible. In conclusion, one difficulty is to determine in which males CIS should be suspected; secondly, there does not as yet exist an optimal noninvasive method of diagnosis that is more acceptable than an open surgical biopsy.

AB  - Abstract: Bacterial sepsis remains a frequent complication after liver transplantation. We previously reported the results of a pilot study that suggested that low expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is a predictive marker for the occurrence of sepsis. We have studied the value of this marker in an additional cohort of patients, and have analyzed the relation of HLA-DR expression with the use of immunosuppressive agents. 20 adult liver transplantation patients were prospectively monitored during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. All were treated according to standard protocols. The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the effects of incubation of monocytes with prednisolone in vitro on the expression of HLA-DR was determined in 7 healthy volunteers. Seven patients developed bacterial sepsis after a median 15 (range 10?20) days after transplantation. HLA-DR expression was significantly lower in these patients on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation compared with non-septic patients. The percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes was 30% or less, 3 (1?8) days before onset of sepsis. On day 7 after transplantation, HLA-DR expression on 50% or less of monocytes had a positive predictive value for sepsis of 71%, whereas the negative predictive value was 85%. Patients who developed sepsis received significantly more prednisolone. Incubation with prednisolone in vitro lowered the expression of HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is a marker for a high risk of subsequent sepsis in liver transplantation patients. This high risk may be (at least partly) related to the dose of prednisolone.

AB  - Abstract.? ?Objectives: Because the trigone is a unique region in the caudal bladder with a higher risk of neoplasia, we hypothesized that this area would have a high proportion of progenitor cells. As yet there is no marker nor methodology to specifically isolate urothelial stem cells, and thus demonstrate multi-potential differentiation and self-renewal. Here, our goal was to evaluate the distribution of progenitor cells that carry two general major attributes of stem cells: clonogenicity and proliferative capacity. Materials and methods: The bladders of Fisher rats were divided into caudal and cephalic segments and primary cultures were established from the harvested urothelial cells. Results: We found that colony-forming efficiency was almost 2-fold higher for cells from the caudal bladder compared to the cephalic bladder. Doubling time was significantly faster for cells harvested from the caudal bladder at initial plating. This suggested that the caudal bladder harbours a higher density of urothelial progenitor cells. With passage to p4, the differences between the upper and lower bladder were lost, suggesting selection of proliferative cells with serial passage. Based on Ki-67 staining, there was no geographical difference in cell proliferation under normal homeostatic in vivo conditions. Conclusions: These results demonstrate geographical sequestration of urothelial progenitor cells to the area of the bladder that encompasses the bladder neck and trigone, which may be a factor in pathological disparities between the trigone and remaining bladder.

AB  - Background and purpose:? White matter lesions (WMLs) caused by small vessel disease are common in elderly people and contribute to cognitive impairment. There are no established biochemical markers for WMLs. We aimed to study the relation between degree of WMLs rated on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of structural biomarkers associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and subcortical vascular dementia. Methods:? Fifty-three non-demented elderly individuals with WMLs were subjected to lumbar puncture. Degree of WMLs was rated using the Fazekas scale. Volumetric assessment of WMLs was performed. CSF samples were analyzed for the 40 and 42 amino acid fragments of amyloid ?, α- and ?-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein, total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), neurofilament light protein (NFL), sulfatide and CSF/Serum-albumin ratio. Results:? Fifteen subjects had mild, 23 had moderate and 15 had severe degree of WMLs. CSF-NFL levels differed between the groups (P?<?0.001) and correlated with the volume of WMLs (r?=?0.477, P?<?0.001). CSF sulfatide concentration displayed similar changes but less strongly. T-tau, P-tau181 and the different amyloid markers as well as CSF/S-albumin ratio did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions:? The association of increased CSF-NFL levels with increasing severity of WMLs in non-demented subjects suggests that NFL is a marker for axonal damage in response to small vessel disease in the brain. This manifestation may be distinct from or earlier than the neurodegenerative process seen in AD, as reflected by the lack of association between WMLs and AD biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract This paper explores approaches to ?later recovery? or ?slow recovery? in post-disaster contexts, viewing it as a positive force by terming it ?slow healing? contracted to ?shealing?. Slow healing hopes to develop a multi-scalar, processual, open-ended, and future-oriented approach to asynchronous and differentiated processes and practices of individual and collective recovery. ?Shealing?, as used here, then denotes ongoing, individual and collective efforts through remaking and building one's life post-disaster. This process of shealing, of re-making and making lives liveable, is a process of assembling, or trying to assemble, life and livelihoods, without necessarily immediately eradicating all traces of destruction which might be vestiges of a life before the disastrous manifestation of compound vulnerabilities. Shealing provides an alternative to assumptive, linear approaches in order to enfold healing and vulnerability reduction within day-to-day, continual, accepted, non-spectacular actions. From a noun or an attribute, ?shealing? functions as a verb by being a continuous and open-ended process in the present, not just a defined stage, whether a hoped-for endpoint or a recovery of some pre-disaster state. Shealing allows theorising the many ways of living in and through disaster experiences alongside the range of everyday post-disaster approaches to re-making one's life that an individual or community might embrace. Shealing forms a joint scholarly-practical approach that better addresses what needs to be done and accepted after experiencing a disaster. This paper focuses on disasters, but wider implications and connections emerge, such as for grief, trauma, and social work.

AB  - Summary Preoperative glucocorticoid administration reduces the systemic inflammatory response. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel inflammatory marker belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity exerting a potentially protective host response. This study evaluated PTX3 and other complement marker changes after preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) early after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Seventy patients were randomized (1 : 1) to preoperative intravenous (i.v.) MP 125 mg (group MP) or isotonic saline i.v. (group C). The outcomes included change in plasma PTX3, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins (ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3), complement components (C4 and C3), terminal complement complex (TCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and 2, 6, 24 and 48 h after surgery with complete sampling from 63 patients for analyses. MP resulted in an increase in circulating PTX3 compared to saline from baseline to 24 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001), while MP reduced the systemic inflammatory response (CRP) 24 and 48 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001). However, the small postoperative changes in MBL, ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3, C4, C3 and TCC concentrations did not differ between groups (P?>?0·05). In conclusion, preoperative MP 125 mg increased circulating PTX3 and reduced the general inflammatory response (CRP) early after TKA, but did not affect other complement markers.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder mainly of children, whose pathogenesis is still unknown. Some studies have demonstrated that LCH lesions produce different cytokines abnormally that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in saliva from children with different clinical subtypes of LCH. We studied 29 children with LCH: seven unifocal (Group I), seven multifocal (Group II), 15 multisystemic (Group III) and 12 healthy volunteers (Group IV). Salivary IL-1? and PGE2 levels were significantly higher in LCH than in normal children. A multi-comparison test showed significantly (P?<?0.001) higher levels of both IL-1? and PGE2 in saliva from Group III compared with Groups II and I. A significant correlation (r?=?0.05) between IL-1? and PGE2 concentrations in saliva from each group was determined. Our findings demonstrated an association between high concentrations of salivary IL-1? and PGE2 and advanced stages of the disease. This allows us to suggest that the abnormal amount of these factors in saliva may serve as a risk marker for disease progression.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Objective The role of bacterial infection in the causation of disc degeneration and its consequences is controversial. The current evidence is limited to underpowered studies, with the majority of such studies having only an internal contaminant arm, and only one study having a control arm with a non-degenerate disc population. The Degenerate-disc Infection Study with Contaminant Control (DISC) study includes a control arm and an internal contaminant control to resolve these shortcomings. Methods The study is designed as a case-control study: cases are patients undergoing surgery for degenerated disc pathology and controls are patients undergoing surgery for non-degenerate pathology, such as trauma, scoliosis or tumor cases. Results This study is part of a multi-centric trial involving six spine centers with 15 spine surgeons contributing. The DISC study methodology, rationale and controversies are presented here. The predominant issue is how to interpret contamination. We present our algorithm for the DISC study to address this. For disc samples that are positive concurrently with positive paraspinal tissue sample, the result will be interpreted as contamination. For positive disc samples with a negative paraspinal tissue culture result, the interpretation of this result will be infection. If cultures for both disc sample and paraspinal tissue sample are negative, then the result is interpreted as non-infected. If the disc culture is negative but paraspinal tissue culture is positive, then it is treated as a contaminant. Conclusions Future large-scale studies are required with a good control arm, a contamination arm, and histopathological correlations.

Study Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study. Animals Dogs (n = 34). Methods Dogs undergoing soft tissue surgeries were randomly assigned to receive either deracoxib (n = 18) or placebo (n = 16) as a preoperative treatment and again once daily for 2 additional days after surgery unless removed from the study. Dogs were evaluated before surgery and again postsurgically at predetermined times using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS). All dogs were allowed to receive another pain medication (except nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or corticosteroids) as postsurgical pain intervention if the dog scored ≥6 on the GCPS or was in obvious discomfort. Dogs receiving pain intervention were considered treatment failures and were removed from the study. Results Two of 16 dogs treated with deracoxib were rescued compared with 9 of 16 dogs receiving placebo (P = .0091). In addition, deracoxib treated dogs had numerically lower GCPS scores. Conclusions Results suggest perioperative administration of deracoxib to dogs at 1?2 mg/kg/day for 3 days significantly improves analgesia in the postoperative surgical period after soft tissue surgery. Placebo dogs not rescued after painful procedures highlight the need for refinement of current pain assessment tools.

AB  - Summary To consider the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathology of equine joint diseases, 3 autoimmune responses were assayed in sera and synovial fluids. IgM-rheumatoid factor and antibodies to heat shock protein 65 kDa were determined by ELISA; anti-nuclear antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence to whole cell nuclear components. All parameters showed only modest increases, if any and not in a pattern related to disease, although some statistically significant increases were detected. Group analysis showed significantly elevated synovial fluid IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) in horses with OA (P<0.01), traumatised joints (P<0.01) and articular fractured bones (P<0.001). There was no significantly increased IgM-RF in the sera of horses with joint disorders compared to control horses. Significantly raised anti-heat shock protein molecular weight 65 kDa (HSP65) antibodies were only found in the synovial fluids of the horses with traumatised joints (P<0.001). No correlations were found between the synovial fluid and sera levels of IgM-RF or anti-HSP65 antibodies. Synovial fluid anti-HSP65 antibody and IgM-RF levels positively correlated in the OCD (P<0.001), fracture (P<0.01) and synovitis (P<0.05) groups. As antibodies to HSP65 correlated with IgG concentrations in synovial fluids, it is not possible to draw conclusions on HSP roles in joint disease pathogenesis. No serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence using rat liver and a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) as substrates. Compared with autoimmune responses in human and canine arthropathies, the low levels of autoimmune reactivity detected in this study can only suggest a minor contributory role to joint disease pathology in the horse. These results have 2 important implications. Firstly, other pathogenetic mechanisms should be considered and secondly, autoimmune mechanisms cannot be used to monitor disease progress and therefore should not be targetted for treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 1999 and (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participants. Methods A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on data gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students and arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results Over time alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse across sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with alcohol abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are the most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric diagnoses and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant increase in indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (MDMA) use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among young people. Conclusions A broad range of globally abused substances is present in South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD trends. Through regular, systematic data collection the SACENDU project has made available more evidence-based information to direct AOD abuse policy and practice and has had an impact on research agendas.

AB  - Background.? The protein s100b indicates astrocytal damage as well as dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is regarded as a marker for neuronal cell loss. Recently, s100b was shown to be a potentially useful marker for migraine in children. In this study, we investigated the levels of s100b and NSE in adult migraineurs during and after migraine attacks in order to gain some more insight into migraine pathophysiology. Methods.? Serum levels of s100b and NSE were measured in 21 migraineurs and compared with 21 healthy subjects matched by sex and age. In migraineurs, blood samples were taken during a migraine attack and following a pain-free period of 2-4 days. Results.? During migraine attacks elevated s100b levels could be observed. Maximal concentrations were detected in the pain-free period after 2-4 days. Regarding NSE, serum levels were decreased slightly during and after migraine bouts. Conclusions.? Our data suggest a prolonged disruption of BBB during and after migraine attacks. Other possible explanations concerning the detected serum levels of s100b and NSE will be discussed; however, neuronal cell death can be ruled out by the decreased serum concentrations of NSE. With regard to the results of the present study, further research is necessary to evaluate the role of s100b and NSE in migraine.

AB  - Abstract Ardisiae Japonicae Herba is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of bronchitis conjunctivitis, pneumonia, and trauma. In this work, a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was first established for the separation and structural identification of the chemical constituents in Ardisiae Japonicae Herba. A total of 15 compounds including coumarins, flavonoid glycosides, and catechins were identified or tentatively characterized based on their chromatographic behaviors and mass spectral fragmentation and by comparisons with the reference standards. Furthermore, a simple high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method was developed for the simultaneous determination of five major constituents. Results obtained from method validation, including linearity, precision, repeatability, stability, and recovery, showed that the established method was reliable and accurate. Bergenin and quercitrin were found to be the most abundant constituents and could be served as chemical markers for quality control of Ardisiae Japonicae Herba.

AB  - Thermal trauma causes tissue damage by membrane destabilization and energy depletion at the cellular level, resulting in tissue necrosis and inflammation leading to delayed cell death. One therapeutic approach is to block the immediate triggering of the inflammatory cascade that results in prolonged hypermetabolic responses and immune dysfunction while promoting the expression of growth factors. In the present study, we determined hepatic gene expression responses to insulin-like growth factors-i (IGF-I) gene transfer to burned rats using high-density DNA microarray assays. The expression of 123 out of ~8,800 genes assyed (1.4% of total) were significantly altered. Of these, 42 genes were altered irrespective of treatment by burn trauma (p < 0.05). Changes in gene expression were confirmed by measuring mRNA levels using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by Western blot assays. DNA microarray analyses showed two major mechanisms that mediated beneficial outcomes after IGF-I gene transfer in the burned rat livers. These mechanisms were the stimulation of IGF binding protein potentiation of peripheral IGF-I and the inhibition of the burn-augmented pro-apoptotic and oxidative mitochondrial metabolites stimulated by thermal trauma.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?University of Melbourne. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.
