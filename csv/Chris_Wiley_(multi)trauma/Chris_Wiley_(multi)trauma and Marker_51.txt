AB  - Abstract??? Objectives:? To assess socioeconomic disparities in the oral health-related quality of life in a group of Canadian children. Methods:? Data were obtained as part of a study designed to assess the functional and psychosocial impact of traumatic dental injury. Clinical data were collected on a random sample of children during a school-based dental screening program that included measures of dental decay experience, treatment needs, dental trauma, fluorosis, and malocclusion. Children with dental trauma and a comparison group of trauma-free children were selected for follow-up. Their parents were mailed a questionnaire concerning the child's personal and family characteristics. Also enclosed was a questionnaire for the child that contained a short form of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) 11?14. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken to determine whether there were disparities in oral health-related quality of life according to household income. Results:? Complete data were collected from 370 children. Mean CPQ11?14 scores showed a gradient across income categories with children from low income households having poorer oral health-related quality of life. Children from households containing only one adult also had higher scores than children living with two or more adults. In both linear and logistic regression analyses household income and family structure remained significant predictors of CPQ11?14 scores after controlling for oral disease variables. Further analyses suggested that oral disorders had little impact on the health-related quality of life of higher income children but a marked impact on lower income children. The highest mean CPQ11?14 scores were observed among low income children with the more severe levels of oral disease. Conclusion:? The data indicate that in this group of children there were socioeconomic disparities in oral health-related quality of life. A potential explanation may be differences in psychological assets and psychosocial resources.

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome in dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

AB  - Summary A technique comprising constant infusion and aspiration via nasogastric tube was used to quantify basal gastric secretion in 9 healthy foals aged 4?7 months and weighing 156 to 215 kg. Gastric fluid was collected continuously for 3 h from an in situ double lumen nasogastric tube attached to a constant suction device (5?10 mmHg). Phenol red (50 mg/litre), an inert marker, was infused continuously (250 ml/h) during the same period to determine loss of gastric fluid through the pylorus. Samples were collected every 15 mins and aspirated volume (VASP), pH, phenol red recovery (PRR) and hydrogen ion concentration (AO) were measured. Gastric secretory volume (VS) and acid concentration (ACD) were calculated. The mean (sd) VASP was 6.54 (1.31) ml/kg bodyweight (bwt)/h; pH was 1.76 (0.25), PRR was 77.7% (11.7), and AO was 0.43 (0.18) mmol/kg bwt/h. Mean (sd) ACD and VS were 59.17 (18.88) mmol/litre and 7.07 (1.73) ml/kg bwt/h, respectively. The AO, ACD, and VS were corrected for PRR. This technique is an alternative to invasive procedures and may be useful for evaluating basal and stimulated gastric secretion in foals and horses.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Although collective action has psychological benefits in non-gendered contexts (Drury et al., 2005, Br. J. Soc. Psychol., 44, 309), the benefits for women taking action against gender discrimination are unclear. This study examined how a popular, yet unexplored potential form of collective action, namely tweeting about sexism, affects women's well-being. Women read about sexism and were randomly assigned to tweet or to one of three control groups. Content analyses showed tweets exhibited collective intent and action. Analyses of linguistic markers suggested public tweeters used more cognitive complexity in their language than private tweeters. Profile analyses showed that compared to controls, only public tweeters showed decreasing negative affect and increasing psychological well-being, suggesting tweeting about sexism may serve as a collective action that can enhance women's well-being.

AB  - ABSTRACT Regulation of bone formation is important in the pathogenesis of many conditions such as osteoporosis, fracture healing, and loosening of orthopedic implants. We have recently identified a novel rat cDNA (best5) by differential display PCR that is regulated during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Expression of best5 mRNA is induced in cultures of osteoblasts by both interferon-α (IFN-α) or IFN-?. Whereas IFN-α induced a rapid, transient induction of best5 expression peaking at 4?6 h poststimulation, IFN- ? elicited a more prolonged induction of best5 expression, which remained elevated 48 h poststimulation. A polyclonal antibody generated to a peptide derived from the best5 coding region recognized a 27 kDa protein on Western blot analysis of osteoblast ly-sates. We localized BEST5 protein in osteoblast progenitor cells and mature osteoblasts in sections of rat tibiae and in sections of bones loaded in vivo to induce adaptive bone formation. Best5 maytherefore be a fundamental intermediate in the response of osteoblasts to stimuli that modulate proliferation/ differentiation, such as interferons or mechanical loading. These findings highlight the close interactions between the immune system and bone cells and may open new therapeutic avenues in modulating bone mass?Grewal, T. S., Genever, P. G., Brabbs, A.

AB  - Abstract Objective Intra-operative fluoroscopy is a valuable tool for visualizing underlying bone, implant, and surgical tool positions in orthopedics. It has brought about the minimally invasive surgical technique of intramedullar nailing to fix femoral shaft fractures. However, the limited field of view and two-dimensional property of fluoroscopic images aggravate intra-operative control of surgical parameters. The purpose of this article is to introduce a surgical navigation system based on fluoroscopy that provides missing information for the procedure of femoral fracture fixation. Materials and Methods Optoelectronic markers are placed on a surgical drill, involved bone fragments, the femoral nail, and the fluoroscope to track their positions. Projection properties of the fluoroscope are acquired through an initial precalibration. The relative positions of bone fragments, implants, and surgical tools are displayed superimposed simultaneously and in real time on multi-planar intra-operative fluoroscopic images. This is achieved by computer simulation of X-ray projections that have taken place with acquisition of the fluoroscopic images. In addition, a method has been developed that allows contactless measurement of three-dimensional anatomic landmarks, based on their representation in fluoroscopic images. In combination with optoelectronic tracking, this enables dynamic calculation of important surgical parameters such as femoral antetorsion. Results A pilot surgery showed that fracture reduction can benefit from the developed computer-assisted method. An in-vitro study on computer-assisted measurement of femoral antetorsion demonstrated the high degree of precision of this technique. Comp Aid Surg 5:311?325 (2000). ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The impact of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for all recipients of deceased donor liver transplants performed between January 1, 1995 and October 31, 2011. In a multivariate Cox analysis, significant predictors of patient survival included the following: HCC diagnosis (P < 0.01), donation after cardiac death (DCD) allograft (P < 0.001), hepatitis C virus-positive status (P < 0.01), recipient age (P < 0.01), donor age (P < 0.001), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P < 0.001), recipient race, and an alpha-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/mL at the time of transplantation. In order to test whether the decreased survival seen for HCC recipients of DCD grafts was more than would be expected because of the inferior nature of DCD grafts and the diagnosis of HCC, a DCD allograft/HCC diagnosis interaction term was created to look for potentiation of effect. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for all other covariates, this interaction term was statistically significant (P = 0.049) and confirmed that there was potentiation of inferior survival with the use of DCD allografts in recipients with HCC. In conclusion, patient survival and graft survival were inferior for HCC recipients of DCD allografts versus recipients of donation after brain death allografts. This potentiation of effect of inferior survival remained even after adjustments for the inherent inferiority observed in DCD allografts as well as other known risk factors. It is hypothesized that this difference could reflect an increased rate of recurrence of HCC. Liver Transpl 19:1214?1223, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a common and frequently lethal melanocytic neoplasm that can quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Currently, prognosis is determined by measuring tumor thickness but more reliable markers for metastatic spread are urgently needed. We investigated whether the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis can predict melanoma metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). We quantified the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis, as well as other factors, in excised primary tumors and in SLN biopsy samples from 45 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Primary melanomas from patients whose tumors had metastasized to the SLN, along with their metastastic foci, contained prominent hotspots of increased lymphatic vessel density, compared to non-metastatic tumors. Multivariate risk analysis revealed that the lymphatic vascular area (LVA) of primary melanomas, an index of tumor lymphangiogenesis, was the most sensitive prognostic marker for SLN metastasis, and was even able to more accurately predict which tumors would become metastatic to SLN than measuring tumor thickness. The extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis is a highly sensitive (83%) and specific (89%) prognostic marker of lymph node metastasis. Assessment of lymphangiogenesis in primary melanomas may be a more effective approach than measuring tumor thickness in selecting patients with early metastatic disease for aggressive therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report intraoperative and major postoperative complications in dogs treated surgically for epiglottic retroversion (ER), compare the incidence of major postoperative complications between procedures, and report survival of surgically treated dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Sample population Fifty dogs treated with 78 procedures. Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed and surgically treated for ER from 2003 to 2017 at 11 institutions were reviewed. Complications were divided into intraoperative and major postoperative complications. Results Intraoperative complications occurred during 2 of 78 (2.6%) procedures. Thirty-six major postoperative complications were documented in 22 dogs after 36 of 74 (48.7%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred after 7 of 12 (58.3%) nonincisional epiglottopexy, 23 of 43 (53.5%) incisional epiglottopexy, 2 of 4 (50%) partial epiglottectomy, 2 of 12 (16.7%) subtotal epiglottectomy, and 2 of 3 (66.7%) other surgical procedures. Epiglottopexy failure was the most common major postoperative complication. The incidence of major postoperative complications did not differ between procedures (P = .1239), although, when combined, epiglottopexy procedures (30/55) had a higher incidence of complications than epiglottectomy procedures (4/16; P = .048). Thirty (60%) dogs were alive at a median of 928 days (range, 114-2805), 8 (16%) were lost to follow-up after 411 days (range, 43-1158), and 12 (24%) were dead/euthanized after 301.5 days (range, 3-1212). Median survival time was not reached after a median of 716 days. Conclusion Although intraoperative complications were uncommon, major postoperative complications were common, especially after epiglottopexy procedures. Clinical significance Although surgical treatment of ER is associated with a high rate of major postoperative complications, especially epiglottopexy procedures, long-term survival can be achieved.

AB  - The regenerative neurogenesis of the optic tectum of larval Xenopus laevis has been studied analyzing the proliferative and morphogenetic phases of the regeneration process after removal of one optic lobe. To this end, short-term and long-term pulses were carried out using the thymidine analog BrdU, selectively incorporated into cells during the S phase of the cell cycle. Results indicate that while in early larvae (stage 49/50, according to Nieuwkoop & Faber 1967) regeneration occurs mainly at the expense of the stem cells present in extensive proliferation zones (?matrix areas?) of the midbrain, in late larvae (stage 55/56) regeneration occurs at the expense of stem cells present in very limited matrix areas of the brain and of quiescent cells, which re-enter the cell cycle following trauma. Moreover, in early larvae, morphogenesis of the optic tectum is carried out according to a precise spatio-temporal order from rostro-caudal to latero-medial. By contrast, in late larvae, the topographical order of the regenerative morphogenesis of the optic lobe is completely altered. As a consequence, the regenerated optic tectum in early larvae has an apparently normal structure, while the regenerated optic tectum in late larvae lacks stratification.

AB  - Abstract Articular chondrocytes reside in lacunae distributed in cartilage responsible for the remodelling of the tissue with limited ability of damage repairing. The in vitro expanded chondrocytes enhanced by factors/agents to obtain large numbers of cells with strengthened phenotype are essential for successful repair of cartilage lesions by clinical cell implantation therapies. Because the salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a major hydrophilic therapeutic agent isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used to treat diseases and able to stimulate activity of cells, this study examines the effects of Sal B on passaged chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were treated with various concentrations of Sal B in monolayer culture, their morphological properties and changes, and mitochondrial membrane potential were analysed using microscopic analyses, including cellular biochemical staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The proteins were quantified by BCA and Western blotting, and the transcription of genes was detected by qRT-PCR. The passaged chondrocytes treated with Sal B showed strengthened cellular synthesis and stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential with upregulated expression of the marker genes for chondrocyte phenotype, Col2-α1, Acan and Sox9, the key Wnt signalling molecule ?-catenin and paracrine cytokine Cytl-1. The treatments using CYTL-1 protein significantly increased expression of Col2-α1 and Acan with no effect on Sox9, indicating the paracrine cytokine acts on chondrocytes independent of SOX9. Sal B has ultimately promoted cell growth and enhanced chondrocyte phenotype. The chondrocytes treated with pharmaceutical agent and cytokine in the formulated medium for generating large number of differentiated chondrocytes would facilitate the cell-based therapies for cartilage repair.

Patients who underwent a kidney transplant from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2012 (followed until 31 December 2012) at Toronto General Hospital were included in this study. Postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage was defined as a drop in hemoglobin ≥20 g/l over a 24-hour period within 3 days of transplantation, followed by an ultrasound indicating a significant hematoma/collection. A total of 59 of 1203 (4.9%) kidney transplant recipients had postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage. Most cases (89.8%) occurred within 1 day after transplantation. Living donor transplants [OR 0.30 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.55)] and higher recipient BMI [OR 0.54 per 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI (95% CI: 0.30, 0.99)] were associated with a significantly lower risk of bleeding. Chronic preoperative anticoagulant usage led to an increased risk of bleeding but was not statistically significant [OR 1.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 5.88)]. Postoperative hemorrhage was associated with a higher risk of graft loss or death [HR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.60)]. While the incidence of postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage in kidney transplantation is relatively low, it may be associated with an increased risk of graft loss or death.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study This is the first study comparing stemness features of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amniotic membrane and bone marrow. Objectives To investigate an alternative and noninvasive stromal cell source for equine tissue engineering. Study design In vitro experimental study of the characteristics of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amnion and bone marrow. Methods Cells isolated from amniotic membrane and bone marrow were analysed for proliferation (growth curve, doubling time, colony forming unit). Immunocytochemical detection of pluripotency markers and gene expression of stromal cell markers were also performed and these cells were studied for multilineage plasticity. Results Amniotic stromal cells (AMSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BM-MSCs) both exhibited mature stromal cell-specific gene expression and immunocytochemical properties, but showed substantial differences in their proliferative and differentiation potential. The mean doubling time for AMSCs was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that observed for BM-MSCs (1.17 ± 0.15 vs. 3.27 ± 0.19 days, respectively). Compared to AMSCs, BM-MSCs also demonstrated a significantly (P<0.05) lower clonogenic capability (one fibroblast-like colony forming unit from a mean of 590.15 cells seeded for BM-MSCs vs. 242.73 cells seeded for AMSCs). BM-MSCs did not differentiate into glial cells, and the osteogenic differentiation process was longer than for AMSCs. Conclusions and potential relevance The amniotic membrane could be a valuable source of MSCs to be used both for allogenic and/or autologous therapies. The noninvasive nature and low cost of collection, the rapid proliferation along with a greater differentiation potential and the ?off the shelf? preparation potential could make AMCs useful for cell therapy.

AB  - Objectives. The current study examined the types of borderline personality profiles, associated psychological disorders and stressful life-events. Design. Data from the British Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were used to examine homogeneous subtypes of participants based on their responses to nine borderline personality disorder (BPD) criteria. Methods. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous groups, or classes, of individuals. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between classes and associated psychological disorders and stressful life-events. Results. A 4-class solution provided the best fit, ranging from a class with a low probability of showing any BPD symptoms to a class whose members had a relatively high probability of endorsing all criteria. Severity of BPD was associated with higher co-morbidity and higher stressful life-events. Conclusions. Results suggest that four discrete classes make up the borderline continuum.

AB  - Summary Background Continuous digital hypothermia can prevent the development and progression of laminitis associated with sepsis but its effects on laminitis due to hyperinsulinaemia are unknown. Objectives To determine the effects of continuous digital hypothermia on laminitis development in the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model. Study design Randomised, controlled (within subject), blinded, experiment. Methods Eight clinically normal Standardbred horses underwent laminitis induction using the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model (EHC). At initiation of the EHC, one forelimb was continuously cooled (ICE), with the other maintained at ambient temperature (AMB). Dorsal lamellar sections (proximal, middle, distal) were harvested 48 h after initiation of the EHC and were analysed using histological scoring (0?3) and histomorphometry. Cellular proliferation was quantified by counting epidermal cell nuclei staining positive with an immunohistochemical proliferation marker (TPX2). Results Severe elongation and disruption of SEL with dermo-epidermal separation (score of 3) was observed in all AMB feet at one or more section locations, but was not observed in any ICE sections. Overall 92% of the AMB sections received the most severe histological score (grade 3) and 8% were grade 2, whereas ICE sections were classified as either grade 1 (50%) or grade 2 (50%). Relative to AMB feet, ICE sections were 98% less likely to exhibit grades 2 or 3 (OR: 0.02, 95% CI 0.001, 0.365; P<0.01). Histomorphometry measurements of total and nonkeratinised primary epidermal lamellar length were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. TPX2 positive cell counts were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. Main limitations Continuous digital hypothermia was initiated before recognition of laminitis and therefore the clinical applicability requires further investigation. Conclusions Continuous digital hypothermia reduced the severity of laminitis in the EHC model and prevented histological lesions compatible with lamellar structural failure.

AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.
