AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

AB  - Abstract The present study aimed to test whether monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphism was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on externalizing and internalizing problems and social competence among Chinese children. Participants were 290 children and their parents in China. MAOA genotypes were ascertained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Mothers reported their parenting stress and engagement in parent?child activities when the child was 6 months old. Children's behavioral problems and social competence were rated by mothers and fathers at 48 months old. The results showed that MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal parenting stress in predicting boys' internalizing problems. Also, MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal engagement in parent?child activities in predicting boys' social competence. The analyses of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk for (a) high internalizing problems under high maternal parenting stress and (b) low social competence if mothers displayed a low level of maternal engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results suggested that the MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model among Chinese boys. Highlights We evaluated whether MAOA gene was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on behavioral problems and social competence among 4-year-old Chinese children. The results of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk of high internalizing problems or low social competence with high maternal parenting stress or low engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results indicated that MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model rather than the differential susceptibility model.

AB  - Abstract Introduction This study was conducted to determine whether an intra-operative ratio of at least 1:1:2 of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):platelets (PLTs):packed red blood cells (pRBCs) improves outcomes in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods A single-center, retrospective study of deceased donor OLT recipients (MELD ≥15) requiring intra-operative pRBC transfusion (years 2013-2016). Patients were grouped into those receiving an intra-operative ratio of ≥1:1:2 of FFP:PLTs:pRBCs vs ratios <1:1:2. Results Patients in ≥1:1:2 group (n = 150) and patients in <1:1:2 group (n = 80) were matched for baseline characteristics (P > .05). Patients in the ≥1:1:2 group had lower pRBC and intra-operative blood product requirements (11 ± 0.5 vs 19 ± 1.4 units, P < .001, and 33 ± 1.3 vs 43 ± 3.3 units, P = .006, respectively), improved 1-month mortality (0 vs 8%, P = .002), improved 1-year survival (P = .004), less intra-operative cardiac arrest (3% vs 10%, P = .03), and shorter operating room time (389 ± 7.2 vs 431 ± 17.2 minutes, P = .03). After multivariate adjustment for baseline and intra-operative variables, balanced blood product transfusion (BBPT) was significantly associated with less intra-operative pRBC transfusion (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.72). Conclusion Balanced blood product transfusion is associated with reduced transfusion requirements in OLT.

AB  - Abstract While current injury criteria for the automotive industry are based on bone fracture, the majority of knee injuries suffered in collisions each year do not involve fracture of bone. Instead, clinical studies of traumatic joint injury often document early pain and development of chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Previous studies suggest chronic disease can be initiated by cell death that occurs in articular cartilage during mechanical trauma to the joint. In the current investigation early necrosis of chondrocytes was investigated after blunt trauma to chondral explants. A non-ionic surfactant (P188) was explored as a potential tool for early intervention into the disease process, as this surfactant has been shown to repair damaged membranes in other cell lines. Three groups of adult bovine chondral explants were equilibrated for 48 h in culture media. Two groups were then loaded to 25 MPa in unconfined compression. Half the specimens in each group were incubated in media supplemented with 8 mg/ml P188 immediately after loading, while the other half was returned to standard media. At 1 and 24 h the percentages of live and dead cells in compressed and control groups were determined with a cell viability stain. At 1 h post-trauma, P188 incubated specimens had a significantly increased percentage of live cells in the superficial zone versus the no-P188 group. At 24 h the percentages of live cells in all three zones of the P188-treated explants were significantly greater than in the no treatment group. This study showed that P188 surfactant could help restore the integrity of cell membranes in cartilage damaged by blunt mechanical trauma. With the ability of P188 to ?save? chondrocytes from early necrotic death using in vitro chondral explants, its role in prevention of a post-traumatic osteo-arthritis in a diarthrodial joint should be further explored using in vivo animal models. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Introduction Obesity creates many metabolic issues in horses, yet stepwise alterations in mitochondrial capacity and oxidant status during weight loss have not been assessed. Skeletal muscle contains subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria, which respond differently to physiological stimuli, impacting tissue and systemic oxidant status. It was hypothesised that horses would display improved muscle mitochondrial subpopulation function in middle gluteal muscle, and decreases in circulating oxidant status markers during weight loss from an obese (7 to 8) to moderate (5) body condition score (BCS). Methods 8 light-type horses were studied. Mitochondrial subpopulations were isolated through differential centrifugation and all enzymatic activity through colorimetric kinematic assays. Effects of BCS reduction or percent weight loss were evaluated using SAS (mixed procedure with repeated measures). Results Plasma nitrate decreased in response to BCS reduction (P?=?0.06) and percent weight loss (P?=?0.06), whereas erythrocyte total glutathione (P?=?0.06) concentration increased with decreasing BCS. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and IV displayed greater activity in SSM than IFM (P≤0.03), while all complexes in IFM had decreased activity due to both weight parameters (P≤0.01). Interactions between subpopulation complex IV activity and weight loss markers (P<0.05) were displayed. Citrate synthase activity, indicating mitochondrial number, was greater in SSM than IFM (P<0.0001) but was unaffected with weight loss. Lipid peroxidation was decreased with BCS change (P?=?0.01) and weight loss (P?=?0.02), displaying greater amounts in SSM than IFM (P≤0.02). Conclusions Alterations in complex activities and lipid peroxidation suggest IFM are more affected by weight loss, with large contributions from complex IV by-products. Mitochondrial component flexibility may contribute individually to disease development and performance of equine athletes.

AB  - Abstract The main function of the intervertebral disc is to transmit and attenuate compressive and torsional forces, and stabilize the intervertebral joint. Unfortunately, the disc may be displaced or damaged due to trauma or disease causing the nucleus to herniate and protrude into the vertebral canal or intervertebral foramen. Pressure on the spinal nerve may cause pain or paralysis in the area of its distribution. At present, the surgical procedures used to alleviate this condition include disc excision, and/or spinal fusion. A more desirable situation would involve removing the nucleus pulposus and part or all of the annulus fibrosis and implanting a suitable biofunctional equivalent. Such a prostheis should attenuate stresses and prevent abnormal stress at adjacent intervertebral joints. Maintenance of normal disc height would prevent impingement of the posterior facet joints and facet joint syndrome. In a previous companion paper (J. Applied Biomat. 5:125?132; 1994), the mechanical behavior of disc prostheses manufactured from fiber reinforced, elastomeric thermoset resins were examined. In order to develop devices which were more practical from a manufacturing standpoint and extremely reproducible, the fiber reinforced thermoset resins were replaced by multi-durometer thermoplastic elastomeric materials. In the present paper, the mechanical properties of thermoplastic multicomponent desings have been investigated. ? 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis. To determine the effectiveness of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation in isolation or within a synthetic extracellular matrix (sECM) for tissue regeneration of the scarred vocal fold lamina propria. Methods. In vitro stability and compatibility of mouse BM-MSC embedded in sECM was assessed by flow cytometry detection of BM-MSC marker expression and proliferation. Eighteen rats were subjected to vocal fold injury bilaterally, followed by 1 month post-treatment with unilateral injections of saline or sECM hydrogel (Extracel; Glycosan BioSystems, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT), green fluorescence protein (GFP)-mouse BM-MSC, or BM-MSC suspended in sECM. Outcomes measured 1 month after treatment included procollagen-III, fibronectin, hyaluronan synthase-III (HAS3), hyaluronidase (HYAL3), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and transforming growth factor-beta 1(TGF-?1) mRNA expression. The persistence of GFP BM-MSC, proliferation, apoptosis, and myofibroblast differentiation was assessed by immunofluorescence. Results. BM-MSC grown in vitro within sECM express Sca-1, are positive for hyaluronan receptor CD44, and continue to proliferate. In the in vivo study, groups injected with BM-MSC had detectable GFP-labeled BM-MSC remaining and showed proliferation and low apoptotic or myofibroblast markers compared to the contralateral side. Embedded BM-MSC in the sECM group exhibited increased levels of procollagen III, fibronectin, and TGF-?1. BM-MSC within sECM downregulated the expression of SMA compared to BM-MSC alone and exhibited upregulation of HYAL3 and no change in HAS3 compared to saline. Conclusions. Treatment of vocal fold scarring with BM-MSC injected in a sECM displayed the most favorable outcomes in ECM production, hyaluronan metabolism, myofibroblast differentiation, and production of TGF-?1. Furthermore, the combined treatment had no detectable cytotoxicity and preserved local cell proliferation. Laryngoscope, 2010

AB  - Abstract Extracts from the seed of the African shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn have been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritic conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which benefit is conferred. This single-site, 15-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range of biomarkers in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex70TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group of participants with levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers in the upper quartile at baseline, there were significant decreases in inflammation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex70TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Inflammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23.9% vs 6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28.7% vs an increase of 17.6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.018. This marker also showed significant falls across the entire study group, 10.6% vs an increase of 11.6%, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9.2%, p = 0.014 (treatment) vs 1.2%, ns (placebo), p = 0.096 (treatment vs placebo). These findings indicate that in patients with the highest levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers, SheaFlex70TM demonstrated multiple beneficial activities consistent with slowing the disease process.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mid-term radiographic and functional outcomes of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) patients treated with the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) technique and to find predictive factors of clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective, single-center study was performed enrolling a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of TPF. All subjects were treated by ORIF between January 2010 and December 2015 at our level-1 healthcare trauma center. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 75?years; ORIF technique used for articular TPF, type 41-B and 41-C, isolated or with associated injuries. The patients were divided in two groups, according to fracture patterns and compared. Their characteristics, radiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Radiographs 12?months after surgery were evaluated for reduction and alignment, and radiographs at 24?months to describe post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and the American Knee Society score (AKSS) questionnaires. Return to work and sport activities were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, and the statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P <?0.05. Results Forty-five patients were included, 29 males and 16 females; the mean age was 54.5?years. The mean follow-up was 57.18?months (range, 26?94). There were AO 41-B fractures (partial articular fractures) in more than half of the patients (66.67%), while the remaining 15 had AO 41-C fractures (complete articular fractures). The sub-type AO 41-B3 was the most common, reported in 62.22% of patients. The mean KOOS score was 69.0. Mean AKSS and SF-36 PCS scores were 79.0 and 41.4, respectively. There were significant relationships between age and functional results (KOOS ADL, Sport, QoL, and SF-36 PCS) and between BMI and KOOS Pain, ADL, Sport, and QoL. No differences were found between the two types of fractures regarding quality of reduction and alignment. AO 41-C TPF tend to develop PTOA more frequently with respect to 41-B fractures, while type AO 41-C TPF had the worst clinical outcomes. We found that the presence of an articular step-off and the malalignment of the tibial axis after surgery were predictive of daily pain felt by patients. PTOA was predictive of a worse AKSS. The overall complication rate was 13.33%: 1 superficial wound infection, 1 deep vein thrombosis, and 4 cases of transitory deficit of the common peroneal nerve. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that early radiographic features may be predictive for pain perceived by patients at mid-term follow-up.

AB  - Summary In the horse, the phalanges are the second most common location for the occurrence of osseous cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) after the medial femoral condyle of the stifle. Phalangeal OCLLs occur in a variety of locations, most of which are adjacent to, if not communicating with, a joint. The aetiology of these lesions is considered to be multifactorial by most authors. Horses with OCLLs demonstrate lameness of varying severity. Diagnostic analgesia should be used to localise the lameness. After localisation of the lameness, standard radiographic views of the isolated area should be performed. The radiographic characteristics of OCLLs are dependent on the stage of development of the OCLL; OCLLs may first be identified as a small lucent flattening or depression in the articular surface; however, they may progress to a circular, oval or conical single or multi chambered radiolucency within the bone. There may be a rim of radiodense sclerosis around the lucency. Diagnosis of some OCLLs may only be achieved using nonstandard radiographic views or may require advanced diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of phalangeal cysts may be conservative or surgical. Surgical treatment options generally aim to prevent cyst enlargement and promote filling of the lesion with osseous material. Depending on the cyst, this can be performed arthroscopically or via an extra-articular approach. Occasionally, the severity of proximal interphalangeal joint OCLLs warrants surgical arthrodesis. Overall the prognosis for return to performance for horses with OCLLs ranges from 30?90% but is dependent on the breed, age and intended use of the horse, surface area of weightbearing cartilage affected, concurrent osteoarthritis within the joint and treatment administered.

AB  - Summary This study assessed the application of a modified equine composite pain scale (CPS) and identified the inter-observer reliability. Associations between CPS scores and the measured concentrations of serum cortisol ([cortisol]) and plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone ([ACTH]) in horses presenting with colic were determined. The study design was prospective, uni-centred and observational. The inter-observer reliability of the adapted CPS was determined for 59 horses hospitalised for a variety of conditions. The associations between CPS, ACTH and cortisol were assessed in a further 49 horses admitted for medical or surgical colic. During hospitalisation, blood samples were obtained each morning and analysed for serum [cortisol] and plasma [ACTH]. Horses were pain scored using the adapted CPS score. Data from the most painful time point (n = 48 horses; n = 48 [cortisol]; n = 44 [ACTH]) and all data time points (n = 49 horses and n = 133 time points) were used for analysis of association between [cortisol], [ACTH] and CPS score. The CPS score inter-observer reliability was excellent (n = 59 horses; n = 102 pain scores; weighted kappa 0.863). CPS score and [cortisol] were positively associated at the most painful time point (P < 0.001) and at all data time points (P < 0.001). No significant association was found between CPS score and [ACTH]. [ACTH] was associated with [cortisol] (P = 0.034) when all time points were analysed but not when only the most painful point was analysed. The significant correlation identified between CPS score and [cortisol] in medical and surgical colic cases provides physiological validation of pain scores as a marker of underlying stress in horses with colic.

AB  - Introduction Requirements of competitive dressage should be reviewed periodically to inform training of horses and judges. The aim of this study was to determine whether features of the FEI definition of piaffe are achieved in competition and to correlate the judges? scores with the degree of conformity to the definition. Methods Videography (60?Hz) of 3 piaffe strides (performed at marker D within a field of view 6?x?4?m) from 60 Grand Prix horses was used to measure croup height (CH), poll height (PH), the highest point of the neck (PN), peak height of the fore (FTpeak) and hindlimb toe (HTpeak), the level of a point half way down the cannon (MC) and the level of the fetlock joint (FJ) to within?±?0.01?m. Paired t-tests were used to compare CH in piaffe with that in halt, PH with PN, FTpeak with MC and HTpeak with FJ during piaffe to determine if the criteria within the definition were met. Piaffe scores from 5 judges were obtained from a subset of 17 horses. Results CH was higher in piaffe than in halt (P<0.001). PN was higher than PH in piaffe (P?=?0.001). FTpeak was lower than MC (P?=?0.001) and HTpeak was lower than FJ (P?=?0.001). There was no significant difference (P?=?0.836) between the scores awarded to each horse but also no correlation between the scores and PH (P?=?0.331), CH (P?=?0.829), FTpeak (P?=?0.784) or HTpeak (P?=?0.924). Conclusions Piaffe performed in competition does not conform to the FEI definition of the movement although judges? scores appear consistent. This finding suggests that the definition of the movement or judge training should be reviewed. Ethical Animal Research Project approved by Hartpury College Research Ethics Committee.

AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of single- and two-segment fusion for Denis type B spinal fracture. Methods Two female patients with Denis type B L1 vertebral fractures were studied. Both patients had achieved intervertebral fusion by 1 year postoperatively, at which time CT data were collected, including data of one patient before and after removal of pedicle screws and of another whose pedicle screws were not removed. The data were imported into Mimics software and T11-L2 three dimensional models established. After construction of the models, they were imported into ANSYS software. An axial load (260?N) and 10?Nm torque were loaded to simulate the flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of the spine, respectively. Results There was no significant difference in the average displacement of the spine motion between the two-segment and single-segment fusion patients without removal of pedicle screws. However, for all motion forms, the average displacement of the single-segment fusion patient' spine after removal of pedicle screws was significantly greater than that before removal of pedicle screws and that of the two-segment fusion patient. The average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of two-segment fusion patient was significantly greater than that of the one-segment fusion patient. Moreover, the average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of single-segment fusion patient was greater before than after removal of pedicle screws. Conclusion Provided there is satisfactory interbody fusion, removal of pedicle screws after one-segment fusion can increase spinal motion, reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral discs and delay disc degeneration.

AB  - Objectives: To identify clinical risk factors for seizures in dogs with intracranial neoplasia. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study of 68 dogs with histopathologically confirmed primary or secondary intracranial neoplasia, complete clinical history and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was conducted. Signalment and clinical history were retrieved from clinical records and magnetic resonance images of the brain were re-evaluated. Prevalence of findings was compared between dogs with and without seizures. Results: Forty-two dogs had tumour-related seizures, the remaining 26 were seizure-free. Tumour types included meningioma (23 dogs with and 5 without seizures), glioma (9 dogs with and 6 without seizures), choroid plexus tumour (2 dogs without seizures), neuroblastoma (1 dog with seizures) and metastatic/invasive tumours including lymphoma (9 dogs with and 13 without seizures). On the basis of multi-variable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for seizures associated with intracranial neoplasia were magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with the presence of neoplastic tissue in frontal lobe [odds ratio (OR) 9·61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·59 to 35·61], marked gadolinium enhancement (OR 10·41; 95% CI 2·07 to 52·30) and magnetic resonance imaging findings of subfalcine and/or subtentorial herniation (OR 3·88; 95% CI 1·10 to 13·71). Clinical Significance: Dogs with primary or secondary intracranial neoplasia are at risk of seizures, particularly those with tumours that affect the frontal lobe, enhance markedly with gadolinium, or cause subfalcine and/or subtentorial herniation.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 117, 221?230. Abstract The trigeminal ganglion is the largest of the cranial ganglia and responsible for transmitting sensory information for much of the face. The cell surface glycoprotein CD151 is an early marker of the trigeminal placode, the precursor to the ganglion. Here, we investigate the role of CD151 during specification of trigeminal placode cells in the developing chicken embryo. Expression of the transcription factor Pax3, the earliest known marker of the trigeminal placode, briefly precedes that of CD151, but they then subsequently overlap in the trigeminal placode. Loss of CD151 protein dramatically decreases the number of Pax3+ placode cells in Stage 13?14 embryos, leading to loss of ophthalmic trigeminal neurons by Stages 16 and 17. Although the initial size of the Pax3 population is similar to that in controls, the number of Pax3+ cells decreases with time without alterations in cell death or proliferation. This suggests a role for CD151 in maintenance of the specification state in the trigeminal placode, uncovering the first known role for a tetraspanin in a developmental system.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to assess the frequency of localised primary canine hypoplasia (LHPC) in a sample of 24 subadults from a Neolithic cemetery assemblage located at Man Bac, northern Vietnam (~4000?3500?years BP), and explore the range of factors potentially contributing to the development of this condition. It is found that 41.7% of individuals (20.9% of primary canines) have LHPC, which is similar to the frequency reported in a suite of ancient cemetery series from Neolithic through to Metal Age Thailand. A range of competing aetiological factors considered included trauma to the deciduous canine, ostensibly by way of early childhood exploratory behaviours (e.g. ?mouthing? objects), nutritional and dietary deficiencies (especially vitamin A and D), the impact of the mother's health on the developing foetus as well as the effects of premature birth on the developing child. It is concluded that while the aetiology LHPC is multi-factorial, the reasonably high prevalence of this condition at Man Bac suggests depressed maternal and neonatal health, consistent with a community experiencing high rates of fertility and transitioning to an agricultural subsistence economy.

AB  - Abstract Skin tissue engineering is a possible solution for the treatment of extensive skin defect. The ultimate goal of skin tissue engineering is to restore the complete functions of native skin, but until now the structures and functions of skins are only partially restored. By negative immunoselection (CD45 and glycophorin A), we isolated and cultivated adult human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) that are of multilineage differentiation potential. In this study, we first demonstrated that by using gelatin/thermo-sensitive poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm) and the immunocompromised mice model, the hBMSCs possess the differentiation potential of epidermis and the capability of healing skin wounds. The in vitro observations and the results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the hBMSCs can attach and proliferate in the gelatin/thermo-sensitive pNIPAAm. To further monitor the in vivo growth effect of the hBMSCs in the skin-defected nude mice, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was transduced into the hBMSCs by the murine stem cell viral vector. The results showed that the rates of cell growth and wound recovery in the hBMSC-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group, which was only treated with the gelatin/pNIPAAm (p < 0.01). More importantly, the re-epithelialization markers of human pan-cytokeratin and E-cadherin were significantly increased on day 7, day 14, and day 21 after the hBMSC-scaffold with the pNIPAAM in the mice with skin defects (p < 0.05). Moreover, the stem cell markers of human CD13 and CD105 were gradually decreased during the period of wound healing. In sum, this novel method provides a transferring system for cell therapies and maintains its temperature-sensitive property of easy-peeling by lower-temperature treatment. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo GFP imaging systems provide a new imaging modality for understanding the differentiation process and the effective expression of stem cells in wound healing. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract In electrocutions, death may be caused by alterations in the heart conduction system provoking ventricular fibrillation. This study aims to identify histological cardiac markers of high- and low-voltage electrocution. Two groups of decedents were evaluated: group A included 14 fatalities caused by high- or low-voltage electrocution and group B (control) included 14 fatalities due to other traumatic or disease causes. Myocardial sampling with microscopic examination was performed on all the hearts using the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains to investigate morphological characteristics that could indicate the damage caused by high- and low-voltage electrocutions. Interstitial myocardial hemorrhagic infiltration was the only differentiating finding, which was shown only in high-voltage electrocution. This pathological finding has not been previously reported, and it may be specific to high-voltage electrocution deaths. Further studies are warranted.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.
