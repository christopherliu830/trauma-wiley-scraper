AB  - Abstract Objective: Despite the spread of time targets for ED lengths of stay around the world, there have been few studies exploring the effects of such policies on quality of ED care. The Shorter Stays in Emergency Departments (SSED) National Research Project seeks to address this. The purpose of this paper was to describe how the indicators for the SSED study in New Zealand were selected and validated. Methods: A literature review was used to identify potential indicators. A reference group of 25 key stakeholders from across the health system was convened, with the aims of validating the suggested indicators and to ensure that other candidate indicators were not overlooked. A thematic analysis using a general inductive approach was used to analyse focus group discussions. Results: The major themes were communication, access, timeliness, appropriateness and satisfaction. The 12 indicators selected after literature review were confirmed and two further indicators added after the thematic analysis. The indicators are: hospital and ED length of stay; re-presentation within 48?h; mortality; times to reperfusion, antibiotics, asthma treatment, analgesia, CT for head injury and to theatre (appendicitis and fractured neck of femur); triage time compliance; proportion who left without being seen; quality of discharge information; and ED overcrowding/access block. Conclusion: Through literature review and consultation with stakeholders, an evidence-based and clinically relevant set of indicators was compiled with which to measure the effect of the SSED target. This indicator set is consistent with recent international recommendations for measuring quality of care in EDs.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) refers to ongoing pain felt in the bones, joints and tissues of the body that persists longer than 3 months. For these conditions, it is widely accepted that secondary pathologies or the consequences of persistent pain, including fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and nervous system sensitization appear to be the main contributors to pain and disability. While exercise is a primary treatment modality for CMP, the intent is often to improve physical function with less attention to secondary pathologies. Exercise interventions for CMP which address secondary pathologies align with contemporary pain rehabilitation practices and have greater potential to improve patient outcomes above exercise alone. Biopsychosocial treatment which acknowledges and addresses the biological, psychological and social contributions to pain and disability is currently seen as the most efficacious approach to chronic pain. This clinical update discusses key aspects of a biopsychosocial approach concerning exercise prescription for CMP and considers both patient needs and clinician competencies. There is consensus for individualized, supervised exercise based on patient presentation, goals and preference that is perceived as safe and non-threatening to avoid fostering unhelpful associations between physical activity and pain. The weight of evidence supporting exercise for CMP has been provided by aerobic and resistance exercise studies, although there is considerable uncertainty on how to best apply the findings to exercise prescription. In this clinical update, we also provide evidence-based guidance on exercise prescription for CMP through a synthesis of published work within the field of exercise and CMP rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) has been postulated to be a key regulator involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration of sensory hair cells. Here we have addressed the potential functions of FGF2 during the formation and regeneration of the auditory epithelium in chicken and mice. By using viral gene transfer, based on herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1), we show that ectopically applied FGF2 drastically increases the number of cells expressing early hair cell markers during embryonic development in avians. Intriguingly, FGF2 does not stimulate cell division during this process. These data suggest that FGF2 plays a role during differentiation of sensory hair cells in avians. To address the potential functions of FGF2 during murine inner ear development, we analyzed FGF2 mouse mutants. Mice lacking FGF2 showed normal formation of the inner ear, and no abnormalities were observed at the adult stage. Moreover, FGF2 mouse mutants showed similar hearing thresholds compared with those observed in control mice before and after noise damage. Therefore, endogenous FGF2 appears not to be essential for the development or functional maintenance of the auditory organ in mammals. In light of these results, the differential roles of FGF2 in the vertebrate inner ear are discussed with respect to its previously postulated functions. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which are dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Abstract Proliferation of astrocytes plays an essential role during ontogeny and in the adult brain, where it occurs following trauma and in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases as well as in normal, healthy mammals. The cellular mechanisms underlying glial proliferation remain poorly understood. As dopamine is known to modulate proliferation in different cell populations, we investigated the effects of dopamine on the proliferation of striatal astrocytes in vitro. We found that dopamine reduced proliferation. As proliferation involves, among other things, a change in cell volume, which normally comes with water movement across the membrane, water channels might represent a molecular target of the dopamine effect. Therefore we studied the effect of dopamine on aquaporin?4 (AQP4) expression, the main aquaporin subtype expressed in glial cells, and observed a down-regulation of the AQP4-M23 isoform. This down-regulation was the cause of the dopamine-induced decrease in proliferation as knockdown of AQP4 using siRNA techniques mimicked the effects of dopamine on proliferation. Furthermore, stimulation of glial proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor was also abolished by knocking down AQP4. In addition, blocking of AQP4 with 10??m tetraethylammonium inhibited osmotically induced cell swelling and stimulation of glial cell proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor. These results demonstrate a clear-cut involvement of AQP4 in the regulation of proliferation and implicate that modulation of AQP4 could be used therapeutically in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in the regulation of reactive astrogliosis by preventing or reducing the glia scar formation, thus improving regeneration following ischemia or other trauma.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract The controversy regarding the role of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning has been re-ignited following the publication of a further randomized controlled trial by Weaver et al., the results of which appear to conflict with our findings. Comparative analysis suggests that the apparent outcome differences may be secondary to the design, analysis and interpretation of the results of the two studies. Following careful analysis of these two papers and further results from a study by Raphael et al on 385 CO-poisoned patients, we can still find no convincing evidence favouring HBO therapy. Pending further research to determine optimal oxygen therapy for CO-poisoning, current therapy should involve stratifying patients for risk of a poor outcome. This stratification may be aided by the evolving availability of biochemical markers of brain injury and the finding that patients with transient loss of consciousness and poor performance on neuropsychological tests of the supervisory attention system are at higher risk of neuropsychological sequelae. We propose that those patients most at risk be admitted and receive more prolonged normobaric oxygen therapy whilst those with more minor CO-poisoning should be provided with normobaric oxygen of no less than 6 h duration and certainly until sign and symptom free.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the outcome effects of cognitive match between Asian and White outpatient clients and their therapists. Many clinicians believe that one hindrance to the treatment of ethnic minority clients is that therapists and clients may not share common assumptions and attitudes about therapy and about the problems that are presented in treatment. The study investigated client?therapist similarity in their perceptions of the presenting problem, coping orientation, and expectations about treatment goals. This study constituted a more rigorous test of the cognitive match hypotheses in that it was prospective in nature, used separate and independent sources for the cognitive predictors, employed multiple outcome measures, and focused on specific attitudes and perceptions that are quite salient and relevant to treatment. Cognitive match on treatment goals was predictive of session impact. Moreover, cognitive matches in avoidant coping orientation and in perceived distress associated with interpersonal problems were predictive of certain treatment outcomes. The findings may help explain why clients matched on ethnicity with their therapists tend to stay longer in treatment and do better in psychotherapy. ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 5.3 million people in the United States, and there are 12,500 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) every year. There is yet a significant need for in vitro models of TBI and SCI in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying central nervous system (CNS) injury and to identify and test therapeutics to aid in recovery from neuronal injuries. While TBI or SCI studies have been aided with traditional in vivo and in vitro models, the innate limitations in specificity of injury, isolation of neuronal regions, and reproducibility of these models can decrease their usefulness in examining the neurobiology of injury. Microfluidic devices provide several advantages over traditional methods by allowing researchers to (1) examine the effect of injury on specific neural components, (2) fluidically isolate neuronal regions to examine specific effects on subcellular components, and (3) reproducibly create a variety of injuries to model TBI and SCI. These microfluidic devices are adaptable for modeling a wide range of injuries, and in this review, we will examine different methodologies and models recently utilized to examine neuronal injury. Specifically, we will examine vacuum-assisted axotomy, physical injury, chemical injury, and laser-based axotomy. Finally, we will discuss the benefits and downsides to each type of injury model and discuss how researchers can use these parameters to pick a particular microfluidic device to model CNS injury.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Contamination and infection of synovial cavities are a common occurrence in clinical practice and, if inadequately treated, may have career or life threatening consequences for affected horses. Hypothesis: The objectives in treating contamination and infection of joints, tendon sheaths and bursae are most effectively met by endoscopic surgery. Methods: Over a 6 year period, cases of synovial contamination and infection admitted to a referral clinic were evaluated and treated endoscopically. The horses received local and systemic antimicrobial drugs with minimal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication but no other medical or surgical treatment. All arthroscope and instrument portals and, when ever possible, all traumatic wounds were closed. Diagnostic information, endoscopic observations and results of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 140 affected animals were referred and 121 cases were treated endoscopically. These involved 70 joints, 29 tendon sheaths, 10 bursae and in 12 cases a combination of synovial cavities. The most common aetiologies were open wounds (n = 54) and self-sealing punctures (n = 41). Foreign material was identified endoscopically in 41 but predicted prior to surgery in only 6 cases. Osteochondral lesions were evident at surgery in 51 and recognised before surgery in 25 cases; 32 horses had intrathecal tendon or ligament defects. Follow-up information was obtained for 118 animals; 106 (90%) survived and 96 (81%) returned to their preoperative level of performance. The presence of osteitis/osteomyelitis, other osteochondral lesions and marked deposits of pannus were associated with nonsurvival. For those animals which survived, non-Thoroughbred horses, a combination of synovial structure involvement and regional i.v. antimicrobial administration were associated with reduced post operative performance. Marked pannus, regional i.v. antimicrobial administration and duration of systemic antimicrobial administration were associated with a group combining nonsurviving animals and those with reduced post operative performance. Conclusions: Endoscopic surgery makes a valuable contribution to the management of synovial contamination and infection. Potential relevance: The information obtained from and therapeutic options offered by endoscopy justify its early use in cases of synovial contamination and infection.

Research is beginning to investigate the biological mechanisms that may be impacted by childhood trauma in general and parental high conflict specifically. This paper reviews the existing research concerning the relationship between exposure to high parental conflict/trauma and the biological stress response system (the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic nervous system), sleep, and psychological maladjustment. We propose a conceptual model linking biological and psychological responses and discuss suggestions for future research.

AB  - Purpose Motion artifact limits the clinical translation of high-field MR. We present an optical prospective motion correction system for 7 Tesla MRI using a custom-built, within-coil camera to track an optical marker mounted on a subject. Methods The camera was constructed to fit between the transmit?receive coils with direct line of sight to a forehead-mounted marker, improving upon prior mouthpiece work at 7 Tesla MRI. We validated the system by acquiring a 3D-IR-FSPGR on a phantom with deliberate motion applied. The same 3D-IR-FSPGR and a 2D gradient echo were then acquired on 7 volunteers, with/without deliberate motion and with/without motion correction. Three neuroradiologists blindly assessed image quality. In 1 subject, an ultrahigh-resolution 2D gradient echo with 4 averages was acquired with motion correction. Four single-average acquisitions were then acquired serially, with the subject allowed to move between acquisitions. A fifth single-average 2D gradient echo was acquired following subject removal and reentry. Results In both the phantom and human subjects, deliberate and involuntary motion were well corrected. Despite marked levels of motion, high-quality images were produced without spurious artifacts. The quantitative ratings confirmed significant improvements in image quality in the absence and presence of deliberate motion across both acquisitions (P < .001). The system enabled ultrahigh-resolution visualization of the hippocampus during a long scan and robust alignment of serially acquired scans with interspersed movement. Conclusion We demonstrate the use of a within-coil camera to perform optical prospective motion correction and ultrahigh-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla MRI. The setup does not require a mouthpiece, which could improve accessibility of motion correction during 7 Tesla MRI exams.

Study Design Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Animals Dogs (n?=?206) with CEHPSS. Methods Medical records of dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC were reviewed for perioperative and short-term (<1 month) data. Long-term follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview with referring veterinarians and/or owners. Kaplan?Meier analysis was used to estimate median survival time. Factors associated with short-term survival, outcome grade, and total survival time were identified. Results Fifteen dogs died <1 month after ARC placement. Follow-up data were obtained for 112 of 191 dogs that survived >1 month; median follow was 54 months (range, 1?175 months) and 103 (92%) dogs had no clinical signs. Estimated median survival time was 152 months. Variables significantly associated with short-term survival included being intact and a low total white blood cell (WBC) count. Variables significantly associated with a successful outcome included having surgery later in the study period and negative postoperative nuclear scintigraphy. In the long-term survival analyses, intact dogs and those with higher WBC counts and occlusion pressures and lower bile acid concentrations were more likely to survive. Conclusions Dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC generally have a good prognosis and prolonged postoperative survival.

AB  - Abstract Background and purpose Abdominal organ motion seriously compromises the targeting accuracy for particle therapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study compares three different abdominal corsets regarding their ability to reduce pancreatic motion and their potential usability in particle therapy. Materials and methods A patient-individualized polyurethane (PU), a semi-individualized polyethylene (PE), and a patient-individualized three-dimensional-scan based polyethylene (3D-PE) corset were manufactured for one healthy volunteer. Time-resolved volumetric four-dimensional-magnetic resonance imaging (4D-MRI) and single-slice two-dimensional (2D) cine-MRI scans were acquired on two consecutive days to compare free-breathing motion patterns with and without corsets. The corset material properties, such as thickness variance, material homogeneity in Hounsfield units (HU) on computed tomography (CT) scans, and manufacturing features were compared. The water equivalent ratio (WER) of corset material samples was measured using a multi-layer ionization chamber for proton energies of 150 and 200 MeV. Results All corsets reduced the pancreatic motion on average by 9.6 mm in inferior?superior and by 3.2 mm in anterior-posterior direction. With corset, the breathing frequency was approximately doubled and the day-to-day motion variations were reduced. The WER measurements showed an average value of 0.993 and 0.956 for the PE and 3DPE corset, respectively, and of 0.298 for the PU corset. The PE and 3DPE corsets showed a constant thickness of 2.8 ± 0.2 and 3.8 ± 0.2 mm, respectively and a homogeneous material composition with a standard deviation (SD) of 31 and 32 HU, respectively. The PU corset showed a variable thickness of 4.2 ? 25.6 mm and a heterogeneous structure with air inclusions with an SD of 113 HU. Conclusion Abdominal corsets may be effective devices to reduce pancreatic motion. For particle therapy, PE-based corsets are preferred over PU-based corset due to their material homogeneity and constant thickness.

AB  - Stretching is commonly practiced before sports participation; however, effects on subsequent performance and injury prevention are not well understood. There is an abundance of literature demonstrating that a single bout of stretching acutely impairs muscle strength, with a lesser effect on power. The extent to which these effects are apparent when stretching is combined with other aspects of a pre-participation warm-up, such as practice drills and low intensity dynamic exercises, is not known. With respect to the effect of pre-participation stretching on injury prevention a limited number of studies of varying quality have shown mixed results. A general consensus is that stretching in addition to warm-up does not affect the incidence of overuse injuries. There is evidence that pre-participation stretching reduces the incidence of muscle strains but there is clearly a need for further work. Future prospective randomized studies should use stretching interventions that are effective at decreasing passive resistance to stretch and assess effects on subsequent injury incidence in sports with a high prevalence of muscle strains.

AB  - Summary Furcation defects present the greatest challenges to the success of periodontal therapy, as a reduced efficacy of periodontal therapy and higher risk of tooth loss have been consistently observed in multi-rooted teeth with furcation involvement, regardless of the treatment modality employed. An accurate and precise pre-surgical diagnosis is essential in order to approach correctly patients affected by periodontal disease complicated by the invasion of molar furcation areas. Root amputation can usually be indicated in the maxillary molars for removing the distal root, thus avoiding the need to restore the tooth with a crown in a conservative treatment plan. Treatment options for molars with furcation involvement could be divided into three different modalities: conservative procedures, regenerative procedures, and resective procedures. Resective techniques have been developed especially for deep class II and class III furcation-involved molars to overcome the anatomical limitations by physically removing both the dental and osseous structures that make up the defect.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To evaluate the quality of life of survivors of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and to correlate quality of life with clinically important parameters. Methods: Cohort followed at least six months after hospital discharge. Eligible patients had survived to hospital discharge after sudden cardiac arrest in 1) EDs, wards, and intensive care units of five university hospitals and 2) all locations outside hospitals in two midsized cities. Of 126 patients discharged alive, 30 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 96 patients remaining, 86 (90% of available patients, 68% of survivors to discharge) completed the interview. Quality of life was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, which describes health as a utility score on a scale from perfect health (equal to 1.0) to death (equal to 0.) Results: Mean age (±SD) of interviewed survivors was 65 ± 14 years, and 47 (55%) were male; mean time between collapse and initiation of CPR was 2.2 ± 2.6 minutes. Mean utility was 0.72 (±0.22). Utilities were significantly higher among patients who had a shorter duration of resuscitation (mean ? 0.81 for those who received less than 2 minutes of CPR, 0.76 for those who received 3 to 10 minutes, and 0.65 for others, p ? 0.05, r2? 0.07). Mean utilities of survivors were worse than those of the general population (mean ? 0.85 ± 0.16, p < 0.01) and those whose activities were not limited by chronic disease (mean ? 0.91 ± 0.08, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Although overall survival was poor, most survivors had acceptable health-related quality of life. Therefore, concerns about poor quality of life are not a valid reason to abandon efforts to improve the health care system's response to victims of sudden cardiac arrest. Further research is necessary to identify effective strategies for improving both survival and quality of life after cardiac arrest.

AB  - Summary.? The work of the Medical Research Council School Epidemics Committee?established in 1929 to undertake a study of ?droplet infections? in the ?semi-isolated? populations of England's public schools?represents a little-known chapter in the historical development of applied medical statistics. Drawing on documents in the National Archives, London, we trace the original scheme for the Committee to Miss Ethel Newbold (1882?1933), a Fellow and Council member of the Royal Statistical Society and the first woman to be awarded the Society's Guy Medal (1928, in silver). Using the Committee's surviving records, databases of disease incidence are constructed for a multicentre cohort of 27 boarding schools, 1930?1939. Exploratory analysis of the data is illustrated by applying non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and Poisson regression to the themes of disease comorbidity and frequency of outbreak. Prompted by the emerging epidemiological concepts of pathogen?pathogen interaction and syndemicity, the multi-dimensional scaling analysis highlights the apparent epidemiological independence of common acute childhood infections (including chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, scarlet fever and whooping cough) in the disease system. Poisson regression reveals a complex pattern of controls on the frequency of school epidemics that vary by disease. The results that are obtained underscore the continuing relevance of the historical disease records of semi-isolated institutions, such as boarding schools, to an epidemiological understanding of common acute childhood infections and other ailments.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Purpose:?? We have recently shown mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from haemangioma stained strongly for OPG. Vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) is an established marker for immature cells of mesenchymal origin. This study characterises haemangioma biopsies at different phases of progression to identify the presence of progenitor cells. Methods:?? Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of haemangioma at different phases of progression for vimentin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), von Willebrand factor and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1). Results:?? Positive staining for OPG and vimentin was observed on progenitor cells in the proliferating and early involuting phases of haemangioma. Strong Glut-1 staining of mature capillaries of the involuted phase was inversely related to the degree of OPG and vimentin IR. Positive vimentin staining of cells in the interstitium of involuted heamangioma and weak vimentin IR of blood vessels was found suggesting that these vimentin-positive cells may be MSCs that eventually differentiate into adipocytes that characterise involuted lesions. OPG IR diminished as haemangioma involuted, with little staining seen in involuted lesions. Conclusions:?? OPG and vimentin IR are early progenitor cell markers that stain immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma. In involuted haemangioma OPG IR is scant whereas vimentin-positive cells are present in the interstitium. This finding supports our hypothesis that OPG IR is a marker for progenitor cells present in immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma that is lost as the lesions involute.
