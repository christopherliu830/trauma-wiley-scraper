AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Abstract We tested the hypothesis that race may influence clinical presentation and symptomatology in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). African-American and Caucasian veterans were administered the Psychotic Screen Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), and other psychometric measures at a Veterans Affairs outpatient PTSD clinic. Subjects were consecutive referrals who were not matched for level of combat trauma or preexisting trauma; however, there were no group differences in other relevant demographic or diagnostic variables. Significant racial differences, with modest effect sizes, were found on clinician ratings of psychotic symptoms, MMPI-2 scale 6 (?paranoia?), and a measure of dissociation. No significant differences were found for the MMPI-2 scale 8 (?schizophrenia?), or on measures that might suggest comorbid depression or anxiety. African-Americans with PTSD endorsed more items suggesting positive symptoms of psychosis, without higher rates of primary psychosis, depression, or anxiety than Caucasians.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - ABSTRACT Some aspects of an obese body habitus may protect against fracture risk (higher bone mineral density [BMD] and greater tissue padding), while others may augment that risk (greater impact forces during a fall). To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed data from a multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI)?>?30?kg/m2. Composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces were constructed from DXA-derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow-up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower composite strength indices, suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for the increase in fall impact forces. During the follow-up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall impact forces in obese individuals. Adjusted for composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces, obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft tissue padding. Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft tissue padding, attenuated the obesity?fracture association. Our findings support that there are at least three major mechanisms by which obesity influences fracture risk: increased BMD in response to greater skeletal loading, increased impact forces, and greater absorption of impact forces by soft tissue padding. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Children constitute a vulnerable population and special considerations are necessary in order to provide proper care for them during disasters. After disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the rapid identification and protection of separated children and their reunification with legal guardians is necessary in order to minimise secondary injuries (i.e. physical and sexual abuse, neglect and abduction). At Camp Gruber, an Oklahoma shelter for Louisianans displaced by Hurricane Katrina, a survey tool was used to identify children separated from their guardians. Of the 254 children at the camp, 36 (14.2 per cent) were separated from their legal guardians. Answering ?no? to the question of whether the accompanying adult was the guardian of the child prior to Hurricane Katrina was a strong predictor (27.8 per cent versus 3.2 per cent) of being listed as ?missing? by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). All the children at Camp Gruber who were listed as ?missing? by the NCMEC were subsequently reunited with their guardians.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - A case of cutaneous myoepithelioma is reported. A 37 year-old woman presented with a 2?cm well-circumscribed dermal nodule of the forehead. The tumor was enucleated with the clinical diagnosis of an epidermal inclusion cyst. Histologically, the tumor was located within the dermis and was well circumscribed. It was composed of spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells arranged in organoid nests. Focal areas of extracellular hyalinized stroma were present. Well-defined glandular structures, chondroid matrix, and significant nuclear pleomorphism were absent. The tumor expressed widespread cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin (using AE1/AE3) and nuclear positivity for p63. Variable reactivity was noted with EMA and S-100. The tumor was negative for smooth muscle actin, GFAP, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CEA. These immunohistochemical results supported myoepithelial differentiation. Myoepitheliomas of the skin are rare neoplasms that have only recently been recognized in the skin. A single publication has reported the diagnostic utility of p63 in the diagnosis of myoepithelial tumors of the skin. Myoepitheliomas often display variable expression of myoepithelial markers, with no single marker that is 100% sensitive. The current case highlights the need for a battery of markers, including p63, to detect myoepithelial differentiation.

AB  - Author: Alan R Kahn, University of Minnesota A superficial cutaneous dressing, when applied to intact skin over a traumatized area, is effective in preventing the development of pain, bruising, swelling, and inflammation in the deep tissues beneath the skin. When the dressing is applied over an area of skin that has sustained mechanical trauma, the tissues beneath the dressing do not develop pain or bruising, while the tissues outside the boundaries of the dressing become swollen, discolored and painful. A case study describes the experience of a 65-year-old man undergoing arthroscopic surgery for the removal of a torn meniscus and moderate arthritic degeneration in his right knee. A similar operation on his left knee 10 years previously resulted in a prolonged recovery. Immediately after the current surgery, his right knee was wrapped with the cutaneous dressing. Subsequently he experienced no pain or limitation of motion and was fully ambulatory and back to normal activities 2 days after the surgical procedure. A controlled animal study was performed to investigate the effects of the cutaneous dressing on the response of deep tissues subjected to mechanical trauma. Fourteen rabbits were subjected to impact trauma to the gastrocnemius areas of both hind legs, after which one leg was wrapped with the cutaneous dressing and the other leg was wrapped with a control bandage. Observations of the legs over several days revealed little or no abnormality in the treated legs while the control legs developed moderate to severe inflammation and swelling. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that this cutaneous dressing inhibits the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the epithelium which, in turn, blocks the response of the spinal dorsal root mechanism that is responsible for generating swelling, inflammation, and pain.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been identified as markers of vascular damage in a variety of disorders, such as myocardial infarction, vasculitis, and transplantation. CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation has gained widespread use, but the technique is hampered by the lack of a definition of CECs and the absence of a consensus for their enumeration. Aim:?To evaluate several variables influencing immunomagnetic isolation of CECs, formulate a definition for CECs and propose a consensus protocol for their enumeration. Methods:?We devised a protocol based on CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation and a subsequent confirmatory step with Ulex-Europaeus-Lectin-1 staining. In a multi-center effort, we evaluated the preanalytical and analytical phases of this protocol. We evaluated the effects of storage, anticoagulation and density centrifugation, and compiled previous experience with this technique. Results:?Our protocol permitted unequivocal identification of CECs with acceptable reproducibility. There was an effect of storage time in that median cell numbers declined to only 87.5% of their baseline values during 24?h of storage at 4?°C. Recovery was lower with citrate than with ethylene-diamine tetra-acetic acid after 4?h of storage; density centrifugation was also associated with lower recovery. We provide a comprehensive list of technical recommendations and potential pitfalls. Finally, based on our experience with this protocol and a recent consensus workshop, we formulated a working definition for CECs. Conclusion:?Our work represents an important step toward consensus regarding the CECs. Our recommendations represent the experience of three major centers and should now be scrutinized by others in the field.

AB  - Abstract Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various cell types. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ghrelin on the neural differentiation of rat ADSCs and underlying molecular mechanisms. Rat ADSCs were isolated and third-passage ADSCs were used in this study. The isolated ADSCs were characterized by flow cytometry analysis for MSCs' surface expression markers as evidenced by positive for CD90, CD44, and CD29 and negative for CD34, CD45, and CD11b/2f/c. The multilineage differentiation of ADSCs was confirmed by adipogenic, osteogenic, and neural differentiation. After induction of neurogenesis, the differentiated cells were identified by development of neuron-like morphology and expression of neural markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, Nestin, MAP2, and ?-Tubulin III using immunofluorescence and western blot. Ghrelin concentration dependently elevated the proportion of neural-like cells and branching dendrites, as well as upregulated the expression of neural markers. Further, the expression of nuclear ?-catenin, p-GSK-3?, p-AKT, and p-mTOR was increased by ghrelin, indicating an activation of ?-catenin and AKT/mTOR signaling after the ghrelin treatment. Importantly, inhibition of ?-catenin or AKT/mTOR signaling suppressed ghrelin-induced neurogenesis. Therefore, we demonstrate that ghrelin promotes neural differentiation of ADSCs through the activation of ?-catenin and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.

AB  - Aim The purpose of the present study was to identify molecular markers of hepatic damage during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Methods LPS (15?mg/kg of bodyweight) or vehicle was injected i.p. into 5-week-old male Sprague?Dawley rats. Proteins were extracted from the liver and were electrophoresed to examine the changes in the protein compositions during LPS treatment. Using a proteomic approach, major LPS-responsible protein in the liver was determined. Results A massive reduction in the levels of carbamoyl phosphate synthase-1 (CPS1), one of the most abundant proteins in liver mitochondria, was revealed during LPS administration. Electron microscopic and immunofluorescence analyses revealed large vacuoles, which were often localized in the vicinity of mitochondria, in the LPS-treated rat liver. Furthermore, we found that CPS1 is released into the circulation prior to liver damage marker alanine aminotransferase, indicating the active extrusion of CPS1 during LPS administration. Another liver mitochondrial protein, ornithine transcarbamylase, is also released into the circulation, implicating active extrusion of mitochondrial proteins. These phenomena are accelerated by a heme oxygenase inducer cobalt protoporphyrin whilst suppressed by a lysosome inhibitor chloroquine. Conclusion Plasma CPS1 should be a possible marker of septic liver damage and may be involved in systemic responses elicited by septic shock.

AB  - Abstract The Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo has been housing and breeding slender-tailed cloud rats (Phleomys pallidus) since 1985. Records of 82 animals from 1985 to 2013 were reviewed for this study. The animals were kept successfully in small family groups with a single adult male, multiple adult females, and their offspring. Sexual maturity was noted at approximately 2 years of age and gestation length ranged from 52 to 55 days. Animals were fed a diet including a complete commercial pelleted feed, mixed greens, carrot or yam, mixed hard nuts, and locally sourced browse. Medical conditions requiring treatment in neonates were often fatal whereas most medical conditions in adults were survivable. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates was maternal neglect or trauma (42%, 5/12 antemortem problems; cause of death in 32%, 8/25). The most significant problems in adults were cryptococcal pneumonia and trauma. Cryptococcus sp. was the cause of death in 11 cases (34%, 11/32) and significant comorbidity in an additional three cases. Treatment with antifungal medications was attempted but was unsuccessful in four cases. Many cases of trauma were treated successfully with conservative management or limited intervention. In four cases, treatment was complicated by extensive self-mutilation after surgical repair of traumatic lesions, which resulted in death or euthanasia. Lymphoplasmacytic thyroiditis was a common postmortem finding in adults (95%, 21/22 for which the thyroid gland was examined histologically). It is unclear if thyroiditis resulted in functional hypothyroidism so the significance of this finding is undetermined.

AB  - Abstract Aim To examine health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes on intensive insulin treatment. Methods All children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes above 8 years of age scheduled for follow-up at 21 paediatric departments in Norway, and one of their parents was invited to describe HRQOL by completing DISABKIDS questionnaires. HRQOL was related to sociodemographic factors (i.e. parental economy, education, marital status and to level of physical activity and disease characteristics, obtained from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry). Results Nine hundred and thirty seven (48%) and one of their parents responded. Mean duration of diabetes was 4.9 years (SD 3.3), 51% were girls, 56% used insulin pumps, and 44% used multiple insulin injections, predominantly of long-acting and rapid insulin analogues. Mean HbA1c was 8.5% (SD 1.3). Lower HRQOL scores were significantly associated with higher HbA1c, being a girl and experience of diabetes ketoacidosis. Mothers scored lower than fathers on total score and most subscales. No significant differences in scores were found between users of an insulin pump and multi-injection treatment. Conclusions Health-related quality of life was related to metabolic control and gender, but not to mode of intensified insulin treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine if the quantification of bacterial 16S rDNA could be clinically useful in predicting patients at increased risk of developing septic shock. Methods: A retrospective study of patients with positive blood cultures taken on arrival to the ED. An EDTA sample was collected simultaneously with blood cultures and assayed by polymerase chain reaction to quantitate the bacterial 16S rDNA load. Descriptive and clinical data were collected from the medical record and this was blinded to the 16S rDNA result. Subsequently, the 16S rDNA result was compared with illness severity markers including septic shock and death to determine the relationship between the 16S rDNA load and illness severity. Results: 98 patients (mean age 61 ± 20?years, range 18?92) with positive blood cultures were studied, most commonly growing Escherichia coli (n= 25) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 23). 16 (16%) died. There were 42 (43%) 16S rDNA positive patients. A high 16S rDNA load was associated with an increased risk of developing delayed septic shock (OR 21.9, 95% CI 2.5?192.6) in comparison with either a low or negative 16S rDNA load; with a mortality OR 4.6 (95% CI 0.9?23.5). Conclusions: The quantitative assay for 16S rDNA might be a useful screening tool to detect severe sepsis in those whom it might not be clinically suspected. However, prospective studies are required to further assess the clinical usefulness of this assay.

AB  - Summary Coagulation and innate immunity are linked evolutionary processes that orchestrate the host defence against invading pathogens and injury. The complement system is integral to innate immunity and shares numerous interactions with components of the haemostatic pathway, helping to maintain physiological equilibrium. The term ?immunothrombosis? was introduced in 2013 to embrace this process, and has become an area of much recent interest. What is less apparent in the literature however is an appreciation of the clinical manifestations of the coagulation-complement interaction and the consequences of dysregulation of either system, as seen in many inflammatory and thrombotic disease states, such as sepsis, trauma, atherosclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and some thrombotic microangiopathies to name a few. The growing appreciation of this immunothrombotic phenomenon will foster the drive for novel therapies in these disease states, including anticoagulants as immunomodulators and targeted molecular therapies.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.
