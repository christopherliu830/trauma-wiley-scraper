AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory dysfunction is a critical element of the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. In this Bench-to-Bedside review, we present: 1) the central role of the microcirculation in the pathophysiology of sepsis; 2) new translational research techniques of in vivo video microscopy for assessment of microcirculatory flow in human subjects; 3) clinical investigations that reported associations between microcirculatory dysfunction and outcome in septic patients; 4) the potential role of novel agents to ?rescue? the microcirculation in sepsis; 5) current challenges facing this emerging field of clinical investigation; and 6) a framework for the design of future clinical trials aimed to determine the impact of novel agents on microcirculatory flow and organ failure in patients with sepsis. We specifically focus this review on the central role and vital importance of the nitric oxide (NO) molecule in maintaining microcirculatory homeostasis and patency, especially when the microcirculation sustains an insult (as with sepsis). We also present the scientific rationale for clinical trials of exogenous NO administration to treat microcirculatory dysfunction and augment microcirculatory blood flow in early sepsis therapy.

AB  - Progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis limited to the skin. A total of ten cases, all women, in four families, and one sporadic case have been described in the English literature. The disorder usually begins in childhood and progresses slowly. We report two sporadic cases of adult-onset progressive mucinous histiocytosis in unrelated African American women, age 48 and 55?years old respectively, who developed red-brown and flesh-colored, asymptomatic papules on the face, arms and legs without truncal, mucosal or visceral involvement. The lesions show no spontaneous regression. Both patients lack associated systemic symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia or seizures. There is no underlying hyperlipidemia, paraproteinemia or lymphoproliferative disease. No family history of similar lesions can be identified. Light microscopy reveals dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes with abundant mucin deposition. Electron microscopy demonstrates a high number of myelin-figures or zebra bodies in the cytoplasm of histiocytes. On immunohistochemistry, positive staining with macrophage markers CD68, HAM56 and lysozyme, and Factor XIIIa, a transglutaminase present in dermal dendrocytes, and negative staining with Langerhans cell markers CD1a and S100, and CD34, a marker present in dermal dendritic cells derived from uncommitted mesenchymal cells, are observed.

AB  - Abstract Cell death occurs by one of two mechanisms: apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis due to cellular injury or trauma. Each method has distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Distinguishing between apoptosis and necrosis depends selection of appropriate assays and proper timing. This unit provides an extensive series of assays that measure membrane integrity, cell size and DNA content, state of chromatin, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. The results of these assays allow one to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.

AB  - Summary Background Acute-phase proteins may help assess the nature and severity of lesions and outcome in horses undergoing colic surgery. Objectives To compare serum amyloid A and plasma fibrinogen concentrations ([SAA] and [fibrinogen]) in the immediate post-operative period after exploratory celiotomy and determine their value in assessment of post-operative complications and survival to discharge. Study design Observational study. Methods This study included horses over 1 year of age undergoing exploratory celiotomy. Surgical procedures, lesions, post-operative care, complications and survival to discharge were recorded. [SAA] and [fibrinogen] were measured prior to surgery and 5 days post-operatively. Statistical analyses included Yate's Chi-square test, linear mixed effects model, Mann?Whitney U test and logistic regression. Results Of 300 horses, 52.0% developed post-operative complications and 83.7% survived to discharge, with significantly reduced chance of survival in horses that developed post-operative complications (P<0.01). Median [SAA] at days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and median [fibrinogen] at days 3, 4 and 5 were significantly different between horses that did and did not develop post-operative complications (P<0.05). Median [SAA] at days 1, 4 and 5 were significantly different between horses that did and did not survive to discharge (P<0.05). Logistic regression revealed post-operative complications to be associated with strangulating lesions (OR 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41?3.91, P≤0.001) and higher [fibrinogen] at admission (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00?1.45, P<0.05), and survival to discharge to be associated with lower [SAA] at 5 days post-operatively (OR 0.965, 95% CI 0.94?0.99, P = 0.002). Main limitations A large variety of lesions and complications prevented detailed analysis of associations between inflammatory markers, lesions and complications. Conclusions Horses that develop post-operative complications have acute-phase responses of greater magnitudes and durations compared with those that do not develop complications. This is also seen in horses that do not survive to discharge. Measuring [SAA] daily and [fibrinogen] at admission, may help predict the development of post-operative complications.

AB  - Aim To analyze the prognostic impact of short-term changes in the intensity of delirium in association or not with sepsis. We also aimed to analyze if s100B, a serum protein derived from astrocytes related to cerebral damage, could be a marker of delirium or sepsis. Methods We included 47 patients with acute delirium and sepsis, 36 with delirium and no evidence of infection, and 36 patients with sepsis without delirium. The diagnosis of delirium was established by the Confusion Assessment Method. To evaluate delirium, we recorded the following characteristics on the first and third day after admission: level of consciousness, orientation, attention, hallucinations, psychomotor activity, language and disorganized thinking. Results In 53 patients, delirium improved during hospitalization with 3.8% of mortality, whereas in the 30 patients in which delirium did not improve or worsened, 50% died during hospitalization. The improvement on the third day of consciousness, orientation, attention and disorganized thinking was related to a better long-term survival. s100B and inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interferon-? were increased in patients with sepsis and confusion when compared with control participants; furthermore, s100B, interleukin-6 and interferon-? were increased in septic patients without confusion, but also in delirious patients without sepsis. Conclusions The main factor related to mortality was the recovery from delirium during hospitalization. We found increased s100B serum levels in patients with delirium, but also in septic patients without delirium. This increase was not related to mortality. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 1161?1167.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) are increasingly-recognized health conditions in children, with both acute and chronic sequelae. Risk factors for, and pathogenesis of, VTE are readily related to three principal factors, consisting of venous stasis, endothelial damage, and the hypercoagulable state (i.e. thrombophilia), termed the triad of Virchow. In children, greater than 90% of VTE are provoked by an overt clinical risk factor, the most common of which is a central venous catheter. Risk factors for childhood-onset (beyond the neonatal period) AIS include sickle cell disease, infection, cerebral arteriopathy, and congenital cardiac disease. In perinatal AIS, risk factors are less well-defined, and have been hypothesized to include maternal-fetal conditions. While some acquired and inherited thrombophilias have been associated with increased risk of incident and/or recurrent VTE and AIS, knowledge of other diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of VTE/AIS in children remains quite limited. To date, very few published studies have employed plasma mass spectrometry-based ?omics? approaches (proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics). Ongoing and future research efforts involving multicenter prospective study-derived plasma biobanks in pediatric VTE (such as the Kids-DOTT trial) and AIS (including VIPS) along with new multi-omics-compatible sample processing methods offer fertile opportunities for discovery and validation of both novel risk factors and prognostic markers, with great potential to achieve improved prognostic stratification in these diseases.

AB  - To determine whether there are clinical and epidemiological differences between familial and non-familial Alzheimer's disease, we studied 151 patients with the clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT). Eighty-four index patients (56%) had at least one relative with reported DAT-type memory loss; the remaining 67 did not. For comparison, patients with a positive family history were grouped into a suspected familial DAT (FDAT), and those with a negative family history were grouped into a suspected non-familial DAT (NFDAT). There were no significant differences between FDAT and NFDAT patients with respect to age of symptom onset, survival time, rate of cognitive decline, motor function, behavioral signs or symptoms, head trauma, thyroid dysfunction, maternal age, or birth order. There were no significant differences between pedigrees of FDAT and NFDAT patients in respect to the prevalence of Down's syndrome or age of mortality. To examine a more ?familial? set of FDAT patients, an FDAT subgroup (F2DAT) consisting of 33 index patients with two or more affected relatives with DAT-type memory loss was compared to the 67 NFDAT patients in a similar analysis. No significant differences were found. However, NFDAT index patients had a higher reported prevalence of head trauma than those patients in the F2DAT subgroup (NFDAT 22%, F2DAT 7%, OR = 4.2, CI = 0.9?20.0, P = 0.08). Thus severe head trauma may be a more important etiological factor in the non-familial form of DAT. To better examine this tendency, future studies should be conducted utilizing a larger number of pedigrees and familial criteria which account for the number of persons at risk and the age at onset of disease.

AB  - Background and Purpose Postoperative pain is one of the most common manifestations of acute pain and is an important problem faced by patients after surgery. Moreover, neuronal trauma or chemotherapeutic treatment often causes neuropathic pain, which induces disabling and distressing symptoms. At present, treatments of both painful conditions are inadequate. α-Spinasterol, which is well characterized as a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 antagonist, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antinociceptive effects. Therefore, we investigated its antinociceptive potential on postoperative and neuropathic pain, as well as its effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activities. Experimental Approach Nociceptive responses in a postoperative pain model (surgical incision-induced) or different neuropathic pain models (trauma or chemotherapy-induced) were investigated in mice. Key Results Oral administration of α-spinasterol reduced postoperative pain, when given as a pre- (0.5 h before incision) or post-treatment (0.5 h after incision), and reduced cell infiltration in the injured tissue. α-Spinasterol also reduced the mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation and the mechanical and cold allodynia induced by paclitaxel. Moreover, α-spinasterol inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities without altering the body temperature of animals. Importantly, α-spinasterol did not alter spontaneous or forced locomotor activity. Furthermore, it did not cause gastric damage or liver and kidney changes, nor did it alter cell viability in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord slices of mice. Conclusion and Implications α-Spinasterol is an effective and safe COX inhibitor with antinociceptive effects in postoperative and neuropathic pain models. Therefore, it is an interesting prototype for the development of novel analgesic drugs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Abstract:? This paper explores how the aggressive fantasies and energies expressed in anorexic self-hatred can be recycled to become the basis of psychological growth and recovery. This shift is made possible by focusing on the telos of the analysand's psychological system as it expresses itself through her illness, and using Clark's idea that sanity is a form of recycled madness. It also draws on Jung's view of the unconscious as an active and purposive agent, and libido as a neutral psychic energy which can serve different purposes. I discuss a number of clinical vignettes, focusing on the hard, ruthless, defiant and hateful aspects of (what might appear to be) ?monstrous? anorexic behaviour, and the kinds of countertransference reactions these behaviours can provoke. I also explore what these kinds of behaviours might represent in terms of multi-generational family dynamics, as well as mother-daughter dynamics. At the core of the paper is the idea that the capacity to use aggression in clear ways, but within the limits of conscience, is essential for the protection of one's physical and psychological boundaries. Without the capacity to defend oneself, and the ability to decide quickly and clearly when it is right to risk hurting the other in order to do so, one cannot take any level of risk in life, or draw close to the other. I suggest that for recovery from anorexia to occur, the aggressive, self-hateful, destructive energies which are so central to the illness need to be recycled into these kinds of awarenesses and life-skills.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a dynamic pathological process where excess amounts of thrombin, the principal role player in the clotting pathway, are generated intravascularly. The diagnosis of DIC is very often suspected in critically ill patients although the clinical features can vary according to the underlying disease state initiating this process. A combination of tests performed in repeats is necessary to reliably diagnose DIC. The principal aim in the management of this condition involves timely and appropriate treatment of the triggering process with adequate transfusion support and certain therapeutic agents in selected situations.

AB  - Abstract In cartilage regeneration, the biomimetic functionalization of hydrogels with growth factors is a promising approach to improve the in vivo performance and furthermore the clinical potential of these materials. In order to achieve this without compromising network properties, multifunctional linear poly(glycidol) acrylate (PG-Acr) is synthesized and utilized as crosslinker for hydrogel formation with thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid via Michael-type addition. As proof-of-principle for a bioactivation, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-?1) is covalently bound to PG-Acr via Traut's reagent which does not compromise the hydrogel gelation and swelling behavior. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) embedded within these bioactive hydrogels show a distinct dose-dependent chondrogenesis. Covalent incorporation of TGF-?1 significantly enhances the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs compared to hydrogels with supplemented noncovalently bound TGF-?1. The observed chondrogenic response is similar to standard cell culture with TGF-?1 addition with each medium change. In general, multifunctional PG-Acr offers the opportunity to introduce a range of biomimetic modifications (peptides, growth factors) into hydrogels and, thus, appears as an attractive potential material for various applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Corneal endothelial disorders collectively represent a significant healthcare burden in most developed nations, and corneal transplantation is currently the only treatment available for patients with poor visual acuity and corneal blindness secondary to endothelial failure. Although vision in these patients can be restored by transplantation, the global demand for donor human corneas is far in excess of what can be provided for by eye banks around the world, and this deficit is set to increase with an ageing global population. As such, there has been a pressing need to explore novel and more sustainable options for the treatment of corneal endothelial diseases. In recent years, significant progress has been made not only in the development of corneal endothelial cell culture techniques, but also in the exploration of various translational strategies. Considered together, we are now much closer to attaining success in the treatment of corneal endothelial diseases via a cell-based, tissue-engineering approach. The aim of this review article is to provide an update of the translational issues currently facing human corneal endothelial cell therapy. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose The automated segmentation of each lung and trachea in CT scans is commonly taken as a solved problem. Indeed, existing approaches may easily fail in the presence of some abnormalities caused by a disease, trauma, or previous surgery. For robustness, we present ALTIS (implementation is available at http://lids.ic.unicamp.br/downloads) ? a fast automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method that relies on image features and relative shape- and intensity-based characteristics less affected by most appearance variations of abnormal lungs and trachea. Methods ALTIS consists of a sequence of image foresting transforms (IFTs) organized in three main steps: (a) lung-and-trachea extraction, (b) seed estimation inside background, trachea, left lung, and right lung, and (c) their delineation such that each object is defined by an optimum-path forest rooted at its internal seeds. We compare ALTIS with two methods based on shape models (SOSM-S and MALF), and one algorithm based on seeded region growing (PTK). Results The experiments involve the highest number of scans found in literature ? 1255 scans, from multiple public data sets containing many anomalous cases, being only 50 normal scans used for training and 1205 scans used for testing the methods. Quantitative experiments are based on two metrics, DICE and ASSD. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the robustness of ALTIS in seed estimation. Considering the test set, the proposed method achieves an average DICE of 0.987 for both lungs and 0.898 for the trachea, whereas an average ASSD of 0.938 for the right lung, 0.856 for the left lung, and 1.316 for the trachea. These results indicate that ALTIS is statistically more accurate and considerably faster than the compared methods, being able to complete segmentation in a few seconds on modern PCs. Conclusion ALTIS is the most effective and efficient choice among the compared methods to segment left lung, right lung, and trachea in anomalous CT scans for subsequent detection, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of abnormal structures in the lung parenchyma and pleural space.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors and investigations, smart testing and management for cardiovascular problems in elderly patients. Coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), valvular heart disease, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arrhythmia and most cardiovascular (CV) pathophysiologic processes become endemic among older populations as a function of aging physiology, especially in relation to CV risk factors over a lifetime. In older patients, the symptoms can be subtle or even misleading because of the presence of multi-morbidity. The baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in older adults is more likely to have baseline waveform abnormalities that may confound assessment of ischemia. Management choices entail a constant balance between rationale for aggressive therapy vs. rationale for reduced therapy. Medication reconciliation is an essential part of comprehensive care, and should be repeated at every transition (at home, admission into the hospital, transfer within the hospital, and at discharge).

AB  - We report a case of acute aorto-right ventricular fistula following transcatheter bicuspid aortic valve replacement and subsequent percutaneous closure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare complication is illustrated through multi-modality imaging. We hypothesize that the patient's heavily calcified bicuspid aortic valve anatomy led to asymmetric deployment of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) prosthesis, traumatizing the right sinus of Valsalva at the distal edge of the TAVR stent and ultimately fistulized to the right ventricle. The patient acutely decompensated with heart failure five days after TAVR and underwent emergent intervention. The aorto-right ventricular fistula was closed using an 18-mm septal occluder device with marked clinical recovery. Transcatheter closure is a viable treatment option for acute aorto-right ventricular fistula. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
