AB  - Abstract Adequate training of the trunk muscles is essential to prevent low back pain. Although sit-ups are simple to perform, the perceived high effort is the reason why training the abdominal muscles is seldom continued over a longer period of time. It is well known that the abdominal muscles are inferior to the back muscles in terms of force, but this cannot explain the extreme difference in perceived effort between trunk flexion and extension tasks. Therefore, this study was aimed at the identification of control strategy influences on the muscular stress level. Thirty-nine subjects were investigated. The performed tasks were restricted to the sagittal plane and were implemented with simulated and realized tilt angles. Subjects were investigated in an upright position with their lower bodies fixed and their upper bodies free. Posture-controlled tasks involved graded forward and backward tilting, while force-controlled tasks involved the application of force based on a virtual tilt angle. The Surface EMG (SEMG) was taken from five trunk muscles on both sides. Control strategies seemed to have no systematic influence on the SEMG amplitudes of the back muscles. In contrast, the abdominal muscles exhibited significantly higher stress levels under posture-controlled conditions without relevantly increasing antagonistic co-activation of back muscles. The abdominal muscles' relative differences ranged from an average of 20% for the external oblique abdominal muscle to approximately 40% for the rectus abdominal muscle. The perceived high effort expended during sit-ups can now be explained by the posture-controlled contractions that are required.

AB  - Objectives: Co-oximetry is a complex and valuable laboratory method that measures haemoglobin species and oxygenation status by multi-wavelength spectrophotometry. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for clinically healthy dogs and to determine the effect of time of analyses and sex of animals on the accuracy of results. Methods: Blood was collected from 27 healthy adult dogs of various breeds and sex. Co-oximetry was performed on a CCX co-oximeter that measures eight haemoglobin and oxygen transport related parameters: carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb), oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb), methaemoglobin (MetHb), total haemoglobin (tHb), oxygen saturation (SO2%), oxygen content (O2Ct) and oxygen capacity (O2Cap). Results: Results obtained after 2 and 4 hours were not significantly different from those obtained immediately after sampling. But after 48 hours, the results for total haemoglobin, oxygen saturation, oxyhaemoglobin, oxygen content and oxygen capacity were significantly lower, and carboxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin values were significantly higher than determination immediately after sampling. Gender had no significant impact on co-oximetry values. Clinical Significance: Co-oximetry offers several advantages compared with other methods, including ease of use, increased accuracy and greater differentiation among haemoglobin species.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Highly purified tonoplast and plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from microsomes of Arabidopsis thaliana by preparative free-flow electrophoresis. The most electronegative fractions were identified as tonoplast using nitrate-inhibited Mg2+-ATPase as enzyme marker. The least electronegative fractions were identified as plasma membrane using glucan-synthase II, UDPG: sterolglucosyl-transferase, and vanadate-inhibited Mg2+-ATPase as enzyme markers. Other membrane markers, latent inosine-5?-diphosphatase (Golgi), NADPH-cytochrome-c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum) and cytochrome-c oxidase (mitochondria) were recovered in the fractions intermediate between tonoplast and plasma membrane. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions by antibodies directed against tonoplast and plasma membrane proteins confirmed the nature and the purity of the isolated membranes. The cytoskeletal protein actin, which was also identified by immunoblotting, was found to be specifically attached to the plasma membrane vesicles. The structural and functional integrity of the isolated membranes from Arabidopsis thaliana is discussed in the light of results obtained for the location of receptors and enzymes, or for the determination of ligand binding activity.

AB  - Objective? To compare shear stability of simulated humeral lateral condylar fractures reduced with either a self-compressing pin or cortical bone screw. Study Design? In vitro biomechanical tests. Sample Population? Bilateral cadaveric canine humeri (n=18) without evidence of elbow disease. Methods? Lateral condylar fracture was simulated by standardized osteotomy. Bone fragments were stabilized with a self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw (2.7 or 3.5?mm) inserted in lag fashion. Specimens were mounted in a materials testing system and the condylar fragment displaced in a proximal direction until failure. Mechanical testing variables derived from load?deformation curves were compared between stabilization methods using a Student's paired t-test. Results? There were no statistically significant differences for mechanical testing variables between pin and screw stabilized specimens at expected walk and trot loads. Three yield points subjectively coincided with yield of the interfragmentary interface (Y1), bone at the implant interface (Y2), and implant deformation (Y3). Displacements at Y1 were 48?156% greater for pin than screw stabilized specimens. Y2 and Y3 loads were higher for screw than pin stabilized specimens, but likely supraphysiologic for dogs convalescing after surgical repair. Conclusions? A self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw inserted in lag fashion both provided adequate strength in applied shear to sustain expected physiologic loads through the repaired canine elbow during postoperative convalescence. Clinical Relevance? Because self-compressing pins were easy to implant and mechanical properties were not significantly different than cortical screws at expected physiologic loads, pins should be considered for the repair of traumatic humeral condylar fractures.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the effect and dose response of very small iron oxide particles (VSOP) labeling of human chondrocytes for long-term in vitro MRI tracking. Materials and Methods: Chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage biopsies from four patients. The cells for the dose?response study were labeled with 25, 50, or 100 ?g/mL VSOP. Quantitative gene expression and cellular proliferation were compared with unlabeled controls at day 1, 3, and 7. The cells suited for MRI tracking were labeled with 50 ?g/mL VSOP and embedded in alginate beads, followed by MRI (using T2-weighted sequences) at day 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and histology was performed at each time-point. Results: Histology revealed that VSOP particles were intracellularly confined at all time-points, whereas no extracellular VSOPs were observed. A mean reduction in T2-value of 25.1 ms (±SD 3.5 ms) was found on T2-maps. The chondrocyte-specific genes aggrecan, collagen type 2, and sox9 were all affected by labeling, the two latter in a dose-dependent manner. VSOPs had no effect on proliferation. Conclusion: VSOP labeling of chondrocytes affected gene expression but not proliferation. The labeled chondrocytes could be recognized by MRI for 4 weeks without significant changes in the T2 relaxation time. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2011;33:724?730. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Although calpain (EC 3.4.22) protease activation was suggested to contribute to excitotoxic delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) via proteolysis of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 (NCX3), cytoplasmic calpain activation in relation to DCD has never been visualized in real-time. We employed a calpain fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate to simultaneously image calpain activation and calcium deregulation in live cortical neurons. A calpain inhibitor-sensitive decline in fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed at 39?± 5?min after the occurrence of DCD in neurons exposed to continuous glutamate (100??M). Inhibition of calpain by calpeptin did not delay the onset of DCD, recovery from DCD-like reversible calcium elevations, or cell death despite inhibiting α-spectrin processing by >?90%. NCXs reversed during glutamate exposure, the NCX antagonist KB-R7943 prolonged the time to DCD, and significant NCX3 cleavage following 90?min of glutamate exposure was not observed. Our findings suggest that robust calpain activation associated with acute glutamate toxicity occurs only after a sustained loss in calcium homeostasis. Processing of NCX3 or other calpain substrates is unlikely to be the primary cause of acute excitotoxicity in cortical neurons. However, a role for calpain as a contributing factor or in response to milder glutamate insults is not excluded.

AB  - Abstract Developmental and trauma-induced mechanism(s) that modify inflammation and immune responses in blood cells were recently found to be regulated by acetylcholine. Here, we report corresponding blood cell-specific changes in acetylcholinesterase splice variants. Plasmon resonance and flow cytometry using acetylcholinesterase variant-specific antibody probes, revealed a progressive increase in myeloid cell fractions expressing the apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase-S variant from newborns to adult controls and post-delivery mothers. Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R. Peripheral stimuli-induced modulations in acetylcholine regulation may hence reflect blood cell lineage-dependent acetylcholinesterase splice variations.

AB  - Abstract Background Psoriasis is a multi-systemic disease involving the skin and joints, but it is also characterized by endothelial dysfunction, which may cause sexual impotence and erectile dysfunction (ED), an embarrassing disease frequently neglected by dermatologists. Objective The principal objective was assessing the relationship between the severity of psoriasis and the severity of ED. We also investigated whether severity of psoriasis was related to International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score, whether genital lesions worsened the IIEF-5 score, whether ED was related to factors such as diabetes, smoking and hypertension, and finally the overall the psychological factors felt by the patient. Methods We administered two questionnaires (one of which was the IIEF-5, a validated score to assess erectile dysfunction) to three groups of patients: 60 with mild psoriasis, 60 with severe psoriasis (assessed by Psoriasis Area Severity Index, PASI) and a control group including 60 patients without the disease. Results In the group of mild psoriasis, the patients who suffered from ED were the 56.67%, while in the group of severe psoriasis, ED affected the 46.68% of subjects. In the control group, ED was reported by the 23.33% of patients. The average IIEF-5 score was 18.81 for patients with mild psoriasis and 20.31 for patients with severe form. The difference in the average IIEF-5 scores between psoriatic (mild and severe cases) and control group was not statistically significant. Most patients with sexual dysfunction had also genital lesions; diabetes, smoking and hypertension were not related to lower IIEF-5 scores. The overall psychological profile of psoriatic patients was worse than that of the controls. Conclusion We concluded that ED was related to psoriasis, in particular to mild forms. Moreover, since ED is a marker of cardiovascular events, also related to negative impact on the quality of life, physicians should always investigate the presence of ED in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Aspartate N-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT; EC 2.3.1.17) activity was found in highly purified intact mitochondria prepared by Percoll gradient centrifugation as well as in the three subfractions obtained after the sucrose density gradient centrifugation of Percoll purified mitochondria; citrate synthase was used as a marker enzyme for mitochondria. The proportion of recoverable activities of Asp-NAT and citrate synthase were comparable in mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions but not in the fraction containing myelin. Asp-NAT was solubilized from the pellet of the rat brain homogenate (26?000 g for 1?h) for the recovery of maximum activity and partially purified using three protein separation methods: DEAE anion exchange chromatography, continuous elution native gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Asp-NAT activity and the optical density pattern of the eluted protein from size-exclusion column indicated a single large protein (?670?kDa), which on sodium dodecyl sulfate?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed at least 10 bands indicative of an enzyme complex. This seemingly multi-subunit complex Asp-NAT was stable towards ionic perturbations but vulnerable to hydrophobic perturbation; almost 95% of activity was lost after 10?mm 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonia]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) treatment followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Asp-NAT showed an order of magnitude difference in Km between l-aspartate (l-Asp, ?0.5?mm) and acetyl CoA (?0.05?mm). Asp-NAT showed high specificity towards l-Asp with 3% or less activity towards l-Glu, l-Asn, l-Gln and Asp-Glu. A model on the integral involvement of NAA synthesis in the energetics of neuronal mitochondria is proposed.

AB  - Summary This chapter examines some representative museums and memorial sites to illustrate how they serve to promote nationalist narratives and sustain grievances and tensions. It focuses on East Asia because the national sagas and traumas depicted in the museums of Japan, South Korea and China resonate more controversially in the present. The chapter also focuses on two museums in Nanjing and Chengdu that embody the role of museums and memorials in shaping Chinese identity and stoking nationalism. The massacre memorial emphasizes that the Japanese invasion is typical of what happens to weak and backward nations, conveying a message that is explicitly supportive of Deng's modernization reforms. In contrast, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial museum features an anti-war narrative reminding visitors about the horrors Japanese suffered as a result of the 1945 atomic bombing of the city, one of contemporary Japan's central traumas underlying pacifist sentiments.

Experience of trauma at work was found to reactivate prior trauma in one in two personnel. Psychological debriefing was reported to reduce stress symptoms in almost all personnel who reported stress response. The effectiveness of the debriefing was found to derive, in large part, from talking and in particular from talking with others who had experienced the same situation.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.

AB  - Abstract S-100B is an astrocyte-derived protein that is increased in focal areas of the brain most severely affected by neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cell-based and clinical studies have implicated S-100B in progression of a pathologic, glial-mediated pro-inflammatory state in the CNS. However, the relationship between S-100B levels and susceptibility to AD-relevant neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction in vivo has not been determined. To test the hypothesis that overexpression of S-100B increases vulnerability to ?-amyloid (A?)-induced damage, we used S-100B-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) and S-100B knockout (KO) mice in a mouse model that involves intracerebroventricular infusion of human oligomeric A?1-42. This model mimics many features of AD, including robust neuroinflammation, A? plaques, synaptic damage and neuronal loss in the hippocampus. S-100B Tg, KO, and wild-type (WT) mice were infused with A? for 28 days, sacrificed at 60 days, and hippocampal endpoints analyzed. We found that Tg mice showed increased vulnerability to A?-induced neuropathology relative to either WT or KO mice. Specifically, Tg mice exhibited enhanced glial activation and neuroinflammation, increased nitrotyrosine staining (a marker of glial-induced neuronal damage), and more pronounced loss of synaptic markers. Interestingly, Tg mice showed no significant differences in A? plaque burden compared with WT or KO mice, suggesting that, as in the human situation, the severity of neuronal dysfunction did not correlate with amyloid deposition. Our data are consistent with a model in which S-100B overexpression in AD enhances glial activation and leads to an augmented neuroinflammatory process that increases the severity of neuropathologic sequelae. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Diário da Queda (2011) by Michel Laub has been described as autoficç?o (autofiction), the Brazilian translation of the concept coined by Serge Doubrovsky to describe the narrative working-through of trauma through fictional autobiography. This article re-examines the definition of ?autofiction? and argues that Laub's narrative process more closely resembles Jean-Luc Nancy's notion of a singular voice ?compearing? experiences in a process of ?sharing? that, when combined with touch and affection can ? according to the novel ? more successfully help to overcome trauma. At stake are questions regarding the inheritance of Holocaust memory, as well as its politicised deployment in contemporary conflicts.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.
