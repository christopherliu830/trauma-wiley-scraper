AB  - Abstract The aim of this article is fourfold: (1) to define the notion of ?accent? from two linguistic and socio-psychological perspectives; (2) to examine the multi-faceted dimensions of accent in terms of the (bio-)linguistic mind and the social mind; (3) to throw a spotlight on the convergence of mental health and accent trauma by presenting a forensic case study of mass murder and suicide committed by an Asian-American, Jiverly Wong, who was traumatized by social exclusion and bullying, possibly due to his limited English proficiency in the form of non-native speech traits exhibited in his accent; and (4) to present evidence from neurolinguistic (f-MRI) studies of social pain caused by social exclusion. The discussion here is framed particularly in the context of intelligibility and interpretability of speech in cross-cultural communication through world Englishes and the wide-ranging negative reactions to people who speak English with a foreign accent.

AB  - Abstract Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 ? 10?8 (dominant model), P = 7.76 ? 10?8 (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior. Identifying mechanisms underlying risk for problematic alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations is critical for future treatment and prevention efforts.

AB  - We report four cases of occult pneumothorax in patients who had suffered blunt trauma. In each case supine chest X-rays failed to diagnose an anterior pneumothorax. Subsequent spiral computerised tomography scans of the chest showed anterior pneumothoraces in all cases. In two of the cases anterior pneumothoraces were present in spite of a chest drain having been placed in the pleural cavity. We recommend the insertion of anteriorly positioned chest drains to relieve pneumothoraces in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Summary The restoration of a tooth or teeth damaged by trauma can be challenging. The hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomer or its derivations, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UMDA) form the basis of modern day composite resins. Other components include inhibitors, to prevent premature resin polymerisation and colour stabilizers. The reattachment approach can be used for both uncomplicated and complicated crown fractures. The concept of working from final form is crucial to allow the clinician to carefully control the composite build-up. The key to an aesthetic Class IV build-up can be broken down into four elements: shape, shade, surface texture, and polishing. The chapter presents the clinical sequence followed in the tooth restoration. Final bonding of the porcelain restoration can then be carried out to optimise the enamel, by etching for 30 seconds, washing, and drying thoroughly before applying bond and curing.

In one case, the tics were accompanied by marked obsessive-compulsive behavior. All patients were involved in motor vehicle accidents resulting in closed craniocerebral trauma. The latency of onset between head trauma and the movement disorder varied between 1 day and a few months. Magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed in all three patients, did not detect any structural lesions of the basal ganglia or the brainstem. Extensive bifrontal leukoencephalopathy was found in one patient who suffered severe head trauma.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents findings of a common MMPI profile configuration for a small forensic sample (n = 16) of persons traumatized by life-threatening civilian events or as a consequence of combat in the Vietnam War. All subjects were involved in lawsuits in which the issue of compensation, medical benefits, or criminal disposition and sentencing were important concerns. A review of the existing empirical studies using this full MMPI scale as well as the MMPI post-traumatic subscale are discussed. In comparing the civilian and veteran samples on the MMPI clinical, validity, and subscales a number of statistically significant differences were found by analyses of variance and mean comparison tests of the data. While the profile configuration of both groups were similar (elevations on F, 8 and 2 scales), the Vietnam Veteran sample had significantly higher elevations. It was concluded that identifying an MMPI trauma profile and its variations may did in the diagnosis and assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to determine whether functional disturbances in fronto-striatal control circuits characterize adolescents with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) spectrum eating disorders regardless of clinical severity. FMRI was used to assess conflict-related brain activations during performance of a Simon task in two samples of adolescents with BN symptoms compared with healthy adolescents. The BN samples differed in the severity of their clinical presentation, illness duration and age. Multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPAs) based on machine learning were used to determine whether patterns of fronto-striatal activation characterized adolescents with BN spectrum disorders regardless of clinical severity, and whether accurate classification of less symptomatic adolescents (subthreshold BN; SBN) could be achieved based on patterns of activation in adolescents who met DSM5 criteria for BN. MVPA classification analyses revealed that both BN and SBN adolescents could be accurately discriminated from healthy adolescents based on fronto-striatal activation. Notably, the patterns detected in more severely ill BN compared with healthy adolescents accurately discriminated less symptomatic SBN from healthy adolescents. Deficient activation of fronto-striatal circuits can characterize BN early in its course, when clinical presentations are less severe, perhaps pointing to circuit-based disturbances as useful biomarker or risk factor for the disorder, and a tool for understanding its developmental trajectory, as well as the development of early interventions.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can be used to show brain function. Courts have admitted PET scan evidence in cases involving brain damage, injury, toxic exposure, or illness (?brain trauma?) and to support claims of diminished cognitive abilities and impulse control. Despite the limited data on the relationships between PET, brain trauma and behavior, many courts admit PET scan evidence without much critical analysis. This article examines the use of PET as proof of functional impairment and justification of abnormal behavior by explaining its diagnostic use and limitations, the limited support for claims of its relationship to behavior, and evidentiary considerations that should govern its admission into court as evidence. The authors urge courts to consider PET evidence, claims of experts, and the scope of the proposed testimony with greater deference to the clinical scope of PET, as outlined by the American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria and the Working Group Report of the American Psychiatric Association.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the extent to which inflammatory markers explain the association between handgrip strength and mortality. Methods Analyses of data from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Handgrip strength and inflammatory marker data (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were collected at baseline (2004/5) and inflammatory marker data at follow-up (2012/13). Participant data were linked with death records. General linear models were used to explore associations between handgrip strength and inflammatory markers at follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine associations between grip strength and risk of death. Models were estimated with the covariates age, sex, wealth, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, long-standing illness, and adiposity. Results The sample comprised of 5,240 participants (mean age 65.9 (SD 9.4) years; 53.8% female). Over an average 9.7 ± 1.4 years follow-up, there were 650 deaths. Inverse associations were evident between handgrip strength and change in inflammatory markers in women only. There was an association between grip strength and lower risk of mortality in women (hazard ratio = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74, 0.98) after adjusting for age and wealth. The association was attenuated after adjustment for clinical and behavioral risk factors (0.92; 0.79, 1.07), and further attenuated after adjusting for inflammatory markers (0.95; 0.82, 1.11). Conclusion Higher grip strength is associated with lower levels of inflammation at 8-year follow-up, and inflammatory markers partly explained the association between handgrip strength and mortality.

AB  - Aim:? To analyse medical and witness evidence collected during investigations of infant abusive head trauma with a view to (i) isolating cases where a functional time limit could be established and (ii) examining those cases for evidence of the onset of neurological symptoms. Methods:? A retrospective study was undertaken of severe infant abusive head trauma cases investigated by the Queensland Police Service over a 10-year period. In cases where sufficient reliable (non-perpetrator) evidence was available, a functional time limit was documented. Those files were then examined for further medical, witness or perpetrator evidence of the infant victim?s response to the assault. Results:? A functional time limit was established in 16 of 52 cases (31%). In 11 of the 16 cases there was evidence of an immediate neurological response on the part of the victim. Conclusion:? The study suggests that the period between assault and onset of symptoms in infant abusive head trauma is brief, particularly in cases of an acute deterioration where proximate medical intervention is required. In those cases with sufficient evidence of the victim?s condition post-injury, the symptoms presented without delay.

AB  - Abstract Sensorineural hearing loss is often accompanied by difficulties with understanding speech in fluctuating backgrounds, suggesting that neural coding of complex sound features, such as the sound envelope, is impaired. Here, we studied how temporal and rate coding of the envelope is affected in the inferior colliculus immediately after acoustic trauma. Neural activity in response to amplitude-modulated noise was recorded from the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig, before and immediately after a 1-hr 11-kHz acoustic trauma. Units with a characteristic frequency (CF) below the trauma frequency (<11 kHz) showed increased response gains, a measure for temporal coding of the sound envelope, especially at low modulation frequencies (≤128 Hz). Units with a CF > 11 kHz, which had large acoustic trauma-induced threshold shifts, had decreased response gains to amplitude-modulated noise. Shapes of temporal modulation transfer functions shifted toward a higher proportion of low-pass shapes in low-CF units, and to less band-pass shapes in high-CF units. Furthermore, driven firing rates decreased, especially at high modulation frequencies for high-CF units. The observed changes occurred immediately following trauma and were thus a result of the immediate trauma-induced damage to the auditory system. If also present in human subjects, reduced response gains in high-frequency units could disrupt coding of consonants and consequently impair speech understanding in noisy environments. Moreover, the enhanced temporal coding by low-CF units of the low modulation frequencies could overly amplify responses to low-frequency noise, further deteriorating listening in noise.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Health, disease, and immune function are key areas of research in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited by a lack of direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. Materials and Methods We took advantage of veterinary checks on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. Results We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. Discussion We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of immune function, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Young children are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal trauma (maltreatment, witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) and appear particularly susceptible to negative sequelae. Little is known about the factors influencing vulnerability to traumatic stress responses and other negative outcomes in early life. This study examined associations among interpersonal trauma exposure, sociodemographic risk, developmental competence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 200 children assessed from birth to first grade via standardized observations, record reviews, and maternal and teacher interviews. More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs = ?.31 and ?.54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively). Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms. Trauma exposure fully mediated the association between sociodemographic risk and symptoms. Neither sociodemographic risk nor developmental competence moderated trauma exposure effects on symptoms. The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic stress risk in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and poor mental health may be attributable to increased trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures have a negative cascade effect on developmental competence and mental health.

Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.

AB  - ABSTRACT Symptoms of vicarious trauma, coping strategies, and prevention suggestions were investigated with 105 judges. Participants completed a self-report measure developed for this study. The majority of judges (63%) reported one or more symptoms that they identified as work-related vicarious trauma experiences. Female judges reported more symptoms, as did judges with seven or more years of experience. In addition, female judges were more likely to report internalizing difficulties, while judges with more experience reported higher levels of externalizing/hostility symptoms. Coping and prevention strategies were multi-domain (i.e., personal, professional, and societal) and underscored the need for greater awareness and support for judges.

AB  - Objectives To describe the CT findings in a population of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma that involved the spleen and liver. Materials and Methods Clinical records between January 2008 and June 2015 were reviewed. Thoracic and abdominal CT examinations of patients diagnosed with multi-centric lymphoma were evaluated by a board-certified radiologist. A diagnosis of multi-centric lymphoma with splenic and hepatic involvement was based upon cytological identification and immunophenotyping of neoplastic lymphocytes in cellular samples harvested from a peripheral lymph node, the spleen and the liver. Results Twelve dogs were included in this study, of which 11 had B-cell lymphoma; immunophenotyping was inconclusive in one dog. The spleen appeared normal in seven dogs and nodules were identified in five dogs. Splenic nodules were hypoattenuating in four of five dogs and isoattenuating in one of five. After contrast administration, three of five appeared hypoattenuating and two of five isoattenuating. The liver appeared normal in 10 dogs and hepatic nodules were identified in two dogs. All hepatic nodules were isoattenuating before contrast and hypoattenuating following contrast administration. Clinical Significance The CT appearance of the spleen and liver was normal in the majority of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration of the spleen and liver is recommended when using CT to stage dogs with multi-centric lymphoma.
