AB  - Lymphoma is reported to be the most common nasal and second most common intracranial neoplasm in cats. Intracranial lymphoma may occur as a primary central nervous system lymphoma or as part of multi-centric disease. Two cats were presented with histopathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal lymphoma and concurrent mass within the middle fossa of the cranial cavity, with magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of direct communication. Both cats demonstrated evidence of bilateral oculomotor nerve deficits and upper respiratory tract noise. In one cat, bilateral optic nerve deficits were also present. The magnetic resonance imaging features were similar in both cases and demonstrated a contrast-enhancing intracranial mass on the ventral aspect of the middle fossa of the cranial cavity and an adjacent mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the nasopharynx. Lymphoma should be included as an important differential diagnosis in cats presented with middle cranial fossa syndrome (in particular ophthalmoplegia) and stertor.

AB  - Introduction The use of complementary therapies in both humans and animals has grown over the past decade. Equine back problems are more frequently reported as a contributing factor to poor performance, and back dysfunction affects limb kinematics. This study aimed to determine if (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment has an effect on the range of motion (ROM) of the carpus and tarsus. Methods Hemispherical 35?mm markers were applied to 7 anatomical landmarks of both forelimbs and hindlimbs of 10 sound, healthy horses from the same riding school with similar workload. The treatment group (n?=?5) received (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment for the neck, back, pelvis and front feet. Two digital video recorders set 5.5?m from subjects, filming both sides concurrently, collected 2-D kinematic data at walk and trot, 1 day before, and 2?hrs and 7 days after treatment. Data was analysed using Kinovea software, minimum and maximum joint angles were measured and ROM calculated. Statistical analyses included two-way ANOVA, Student's t-test and symmetry indices. Results A significant increase in right-side ROM for carpus at walk (+4.0?deg, p?=?0.04) and trot (+5.2?deg, p?=?0.02) was noted in the treated compared to the non-treated group. For the treatment group, there was a significant change in carpus ROM asymmetry from left towards neutral at walk (P?=?0.004) and trot (P?=?0.04). Tarsus ROM asymmetry change from left towards neutral was significant (P?=?0.02) at trot. No changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment may improve the symmetry of tarsus and carpus ROM of horses. Further research is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these effects. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were reviewed by the McTimoney Chiropractic College Ethical Review Committee.

AB  - Introduction Water treadmill exercise is used for rehabilitating horses with back dysfunction, yet little is known about the effect of this type of exercise on back movement. Methods 8 horses walked in water level with the hoof, fetlock, hock and stifle. Reflective markers over the dorsal spinous processes of T6, T10, T13, T18, L3, L5 and S3 and left and right tuber coxae were used to measure flexion-extension range of movement (F-E ROM) around T10, T13, T18, L3 and L5, vertical displacement of the pelvis (Pelvic ROM) and vertical distance between T13 and L5 (lowest and highest point of the back). 3D coordinates were tracked using ProReflex cameras. 5?9 strides were analysed for each horse at each water height. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests were used to determine differences in measured variables between water heights (P < 0.05). Results Peak flexion of T10, T13, T18 and L3 occurred in hock height water. Peak extension of T18, L3 and L5 occurred in stifle height water without a significant difference in F-E ROM between water heights (P>0.05). Pelvic ROM was greatest in stifle height water, with no significant difference between water heights. The vertical distance between T13 and L5 was greatest in stifle height water (P<0.05 between hoof and hock height water) as a result of an elevation of L5 relative to T13. Conclusions As water height increases L5 is elevated relative to T13, increasing the tendency for extension of the thoracolumbar spine. To maximise thoracolumbar flexion and avoid extension, water at hock height is more beneficial then stifle height water.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies allow the assessment of variations in body position during jumping. This study evaluated changes in kinematic variables in horses during a jumping test. Methods Eight horses equipped with reflective skin markers were submitted to a jumping test consisting of 70 jumps in 4 series of 10, 15, 20 and 25 times each over a 1.10?m vertical obstacle. Six jumps per series were recorded; a heart rate of ≤ 90?bpm was the criterion to begin the next series. A 25?Hz calibrated camera was placed 10?m from the fence, and 2D images were analyzed. The variables were: overtracking at jumping; take-off and landing distances; jump length; distance between lowest point of the fore and hind limb and the fence; height of head, withers and croup in relation to the ground when passing the fence; and maximum withers height at jumping. Data were analysed with an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test (P<0.05). Results There was a reduction in take-off distance (1.65?m to 1.46?m, P?=?0.03), landing distance (1.99?m to 1.71?m, P?=?0.001), jump length (4.51?m to 4.11?m, P?=?0.005), left forelimb distance height above the fence (9.4?cm to 5.1?cm, P?=?0.03) and maximum withers height at jumping (2.0?m to 1.95?m, P?=?0.001) from the first to the third series. Overtracking before jumping increased from 32?cm to 48?cm (P?=?0.003) and there was a reduction of right forelimb height above the fence from 7.3?cm to 2.9?cm (P?=?0.04), and of withers and croup height above the fence from 2.0?m to 1.95?m (P?=?0.001) and 1.93?m to 1.86?m (P<0.0001) respectively from the first to fourth session. Conclusions The increase in the number of jumps resulted in a decrease of take-off and landing distances, and in the distance between forelimb and fence and the withers and croup height, all indicating decreased jumping efficiency.

AB  - Introduction The study of kinematic patterns of young jumping horses can help to improve selection. This study was carried out to predict free jumping success of young horses using logistic regression to model jumping kinematic variables. Methods 108 untrained young Brazilian Sport Horses of both genders were studied. Reflective skin markers were used to identify anatomical reference points. Five free jumps over a vertical obstacle (with a height of 60, 80 and 105?cm for age classes 22?25, 29?32 and 36?39 months, respectively) were recorded. A 100?Hz camera was used, and images were analyzed using Simi Reality Motion Systems?. Successful (n?=?1,030) and unsuccessful (n?=?200) jumps were analyzed and the following kinematic variables were preselected by principal components analysis and then used as independent variables: last stride length prior to jumping, jumping velocity, take-off distance, withers displacement at jumping, forelimb height at jumping, vertical distance between scapulohumeral and metacarpophalangeal joints, scapulohumeral, radial-metacarpal, tibiometatarsal and withers-fetlock angles. Results The effects of take-off distance, forelimb height at jumping and jumping velocity on the jumping result were significant (P?=?0.0091). An increment of one centimeter in take-off distance and forelimb height led to an increase in the probability of success by 2.6% and 10.6%, respectively. An increase of one meter per second in jumping velocity led to a reduction in the probability of success by 27.8%. Conclusions Jumping success is influenced by take-off distance, jumping velocity and forelimb flexibility. Selection of young horses for superior jumping capacity can be aided by kinematic analysis, which may shorten training time and improve performance.

AB  - Introduction The development of miniaturized inertial sensor technology (IMU) opens new possibilities to assess equine back motion in real-life situations. The consistency of IMU for measuring dorsoventral displacement of the back has been assessed but orientation has not. The aim of this study was to assess accuracy and consistency of miniaturized inertial sensors for quantification of flexion-extension of the equine back, compared to motion capture (mocap) as a gold standard. Methods One sound horse was trotted (3.5?m/s) and cantered (9?m/s) on a treadmill with synchronized mocap and IMU data collection. The amplitudes of two flexion-extension angles were calculated between 3 IMUs (T12-T16-L2) and with a triad of markers linked to each IMU during 15 consecutive strides for two recordings at each gait. Consistency of sensor measurements was assessed using Lin correlation coefficient. Results Thoracic and thoracolumbar angles showed respectively a Lin correlation coefficient of 0.96 (excellent) and 0.87 (good). The difference (mean?±?SD) between IMU and mocap were, respectively for the thoracic and thoracolumbar angles, 0.57?±?0.44 and 0.65?±?0.47 degrees during trotting, and 0.83?±?0.67 and 0.63?±?0.44 degrees during canter. Conclusions Angle values calculated with IMU data showed acceptable accuracy consistency for quantification of flexion-extension movement in a horse's back. These results are encouraging for future development of the method in real-life situations where mocap systems are unsuited for the quantification of back movements.

AB  - Objective:? Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are a population of highly proliferative postnatal stem cells capable of differentiating into odontoblasts, adipocytes, neural cells, and osteo-inductive cells. To examine whether SHED-mediated bone regeneration can be utilized for therapeutic purposes, we used SHED to repair critical-size calvarial defects in immunocompromised mice. Materials and methods:? We generated calvarial defects and transplanted SHED with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate as a carrier into the defect areas. Results:? SHED were able to repair the defects with substantial bone formation. Interestingly, SHED-mediated osteogenesis failed to recruit hematopoietic marrow elements that are commonly seen in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-generated bone. Furthermore, SHED were found to co-express mesenchymal stem cell marker, CC9/MUC18/CD146, with an array of growth factor receptors such as transforming growth factor ? receptor I and II, fibroblast growth factor receptor I and III, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, implying their comprehensive differentiation potential. Conclusions:? Our data indicate that SHED, derived from neural crest cells, may select unique mechanisms to exert osteogenesis. SHED might be a suitable resource for orofacial bone regeneration.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Previous studies show the effect of toe or heel wedges on tendon strain but there is little understanding of the effect of other shoe types. Objectives To quantify the effect of different shoeing conditions on the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), distal check ligament (ALDDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL). Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Twelve equine cadaver forelimbs were loaded onto a force plate mimicking stance phase. Markers were placed proximally and distally in each tendon structure and tracked using a motion capture system and strain was calculated. Tendon strain was determined for the following conditions: barefoot, glue on heart bar and aluminium racing plates with and without packing material. Data were analysed using a mixed effects model. Results Significant variation in strain was observed between tendons. The DDFT had the lowest strain, then the ALDDFT, SDFT and SL. Glue on heart bar shoes significantly increased SDFT and SL strain compared to barefoot for the same leg force. Aluminium racing plates without packing material increased ALDDFT and SDFT strain and with packing material increased ALDDFT and SL. Conclusions Shoe selection should be based on minimising strain in the tendon with greatest injury risk. Aluminium racing plates with packing material may be most appropriate for the majority of racehorses as they do not significantly increase SDFT strain.

AB  - ABSTRACT In December 2004 a tsunami destroyed the whole coastal line, killing more than 10,000 people in the district of Ampara alone and left many injured and homeless. But even before 2004 the whole population had faced 20 years of civil war, and in 2006 this war started again. People suffer from the separation from loved ones due to death or disappearance through natural disaster, man-made disaster and destruction, or separation from displacement out of poverty. A systematic long-term training program for trauma counseling in Sri Lanka was started soon after the tsunami in the beginning of 2005. Located in the Ampara District, a Center for Psychosocial Care was created to address the special needs of children and youth. The program taught basic developmental psychology, special affects of traumatization on children, sequential traumatization, and forms of psychological interventions and psychotherapeutic approaches. Western concepts were discussed in respect to case stories from eastern Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan cultural practices and beliefs. An amalgamation of Western theoretical knowledge and Sri Lankan traditions and history created a new, culturally appropriate approach for working-through trauma and grieving. Mindful intervention by Westerners and recognition of social and political climates, allowed for our students to own the program and individuals to control their own healing processes.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have shown that being overweight or obese is associated with a higher risk of periodontitis. However, the literature offers an insufficient number of published reports regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on oral health. As such, the present study aims to determine the association between periodontal status and being overweight/obese in prebariatric and postbariatric surgery populations of Brazil. Methods: Three hundred forty-five participants between 18 and 60 years of age, from both sexes, were grouped according to prebariatric or postbariatric surgery and underwent a complete periodontal examination. Biologic, demographic, and behavioral variables were analyzed in a Poisson regression model. Results: Considering the timing of bariatric surgery, the sample was divided into three groups: PRE-OP (preoperative, n = 133), POS-OP1 (postoperative ≤6 months, n = 72), and POS-OP2 (post-surgery >6 months, n = 140). Regardless of the type of surgery (PRE-OP, POS-OP1, POS-OP2), the prevalence of periodontitis proved to be high (81.45%). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of periodontitis among the PRE-OP, POS-OP1, and POS-OP2 groups (P = 0.040). In the Poisson regression model, after adjusting for biologic, demographic, and behavioral risk variables, only bleeding on probing remained significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis (P <0.001). Conclusion: Differences in periodontal condition were observed in individuals at different times of the bariatric surgery, showing a high prevalence of periodontitis in both preoperative and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

In this study, we investigated changes to the point of force application (PFA) of the GRF in horses walking and trotting on circles compared to a straight line. Methods 8 horses were lunged in 6?m diameter circles (left and right), and led straight, at walk and trot over force plates on firm ground. Hoof-mounted retro-reflective markers were tracked using a motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp). The PFA was computed in a hoof-local coordinate system during 2018 strides. The instantaneous PFA was weighted by the GRF magnitude to compute an average PFA position within the hoof print for each total stance phase. The average PFAs were analyzed using an ANOVA in which type of locomotion (circle or straight), gait (walk or trot) and hoof (fore or hind) were used as independent variables. A Tukey post-hoc analysis identified pair-wise differences. Results At trot, the PFA moved toward the center of the circle by 19.8?±?10?mm (mean?±?SD, P<0.001). At walk there was no significant difference in PFA between straight and circle. The hoof (fore or hind) did not significantly affect the PFA shift. Conclusions The significant medio-lateral shift of PFA suggests that the balance of limb loading changes during circular locomotion. This is likely to affect the medio-lateral balance in the distal joints and cause sub-optimal loading of limb structures.

AB  - Introduction There has been limited evaluation of biomechanical parameters during flight and their relationship to subjective assessments of jumping technique in ridden show-jumping horses. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15-fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day one and twice on day two; the second round on day 3 was an 8-fence jump-off. Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to determine limb and back angles at 25%, 50% and 75% of the flight phase over four fences using markers placed at pre-determined locations. Technique grades (1?10) were assigned per fence by an international coach. Technique grades and kinematics were correlated using a Spearman's rank correlation test. Results Forelimb and hindlimb take-off distance and technique grade (4?7/10) were positively correlated (r?=?0.29, 0.27, P≤0.01). Thoracolumbar angle (range 178?184°) at 25% and 75% of flight and neck/trunk angle (NT) at 50% and 75% of flight were negatively correlated with technique grade (r?=?-0.20 {P?=?0.04}, -0.20 {P?=?0.03}, -0.21 {P?=?0.03}, and ?0.28 {P<0.01} respectively). Conclusions Only weak correlations were evident, however, the findings suggest that increased take-off distance may be desirable for improvements in subjectively evaluated technique. The relationship between TL extension and improved technique grades may be explained by improved back stabilisation. Decreased NT and TL extension at 75% flight could suggest that back stabilisation and raising the neck in preparation for landing are associated with better jumping technique. Subjective grading of jumping technique appears to be influenced by kinematic features during flight.

AB  - Introduction Hydrotherapy is increasingly applied within the equine industry for rehabilitation and therapy. Substantial anecdotal evidence exists suggesting the benefits of its application but while there is extensive literature on the use of aqua-treadmills in humans and canines there is comparatively little in equines. Therefore, limited research exists supporting the role of the aqua-treadmill in current therapy practices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of water depth on pelvic movement during aqua-treadmill exercise. Methods Eight horses were trotted on an aqua-treadmill at four water depths specifically measured to individual horses (P3, fetlock, MC3, carpus). Pelvic displacement was recorded using an optical motion capture system to collect coordinates from markers placed on the tuber sacrale, tuber coxae, withers and lumbar spine. Data were processed using custom written scripts (Matlab?) and ANOVA was performed. Results All subjects demonstrated a significant increase in vertical displacement of the pelvis as water depth increased from P3 to carpus while displacement symmetry was not significantly altered with a change in water depth. Conclusions The common practice of increasing water depth to intensify the physical demands of the exercise while maintaining the desired movement symmetry is supported. Having knowledge of how a horse moves on an aqua-treadmill is vital for tailoring specific therapy in order to most successfully rehabilitate the horse from injury. Investigation of the effects of increasing water depth on asymmetric horses should be carried out to further support its application as a tool for rehabilitation. Ethical Animal Research Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee at Moulton College. Owner consent was granted for all subjects and all horses were handled in compliance with British Horse Society standards throughout the trials.

AB  - Aim More than 26?000 Australians aged 12?24 years experience homelessness, yet data on the health status of homeless youth remain limited. The aim of this study was to describe the health of young people attending a youth health service in Western Sydney who were experiencing homelessness. Methods Retrospective case note review for clients aged 12?25 years attending Youth Health Services in Western Sydney. Extracted data included: homelessness status; demographics; physical health issues; mental health issues; involvement with juvenile justice; and disengagement from education or employment. Results Just under half of the 180 clients attending a Youth Health Service in Western Sydney were homeless, and an additional 15 young people who were not currently homeless nominated homelessness as a presenting issue. In comparison with currently domiciled young people, homeless youth were less likely to have a regular general practitioner and more likely to nominate a physical health concern as a presenting issue, although there was no difference between groups in terms of diagnosed mental or physical health conditions. Considered as a whole, the sample showed high rates of acute physical symptoms, physical trauma, psychological distress and self-harm. Conclusions Youth homelessness is associated with risk of both poor physical and mental health. As much of youth homelessness is hidden, health-care providers need to ensure that they inquire about homelessness status, and have an awareness of potentially complex multi-morbidities in the physical and mental health of young marginalised people presenting to health services.

AB  - Background One major concern in about one third of elder patients after total hip-replacement surgery is post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment is accompanied with changes in serum S-100? protein (S-100?) and inflammatory markers. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the value of serum S-100? and interleukin(IL)-1?, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in reflecting POCD after total hip-replacement surgery. Methods Forty-two elderly patients were enrolled, and 37 patients completed the follow-up. Serum S-100? protein and IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were determined pre-operatively, as well as 1?h and 6?h post-operatively. Neuropsychological tests were performed pre-operatively, as well as on day 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively. Results Seventeen (45.9%, 17/37) patients developed POCD 1?day after surgery, and three (8.1%, 3/37) developed POCD 7?days after surgery. [Correction added after publication 7 February 2012: in the preceding sentence (54.1%, 17/37) was corrected to (45.9%, 17/37)]. Patients with POCD 1?day after surgery had significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 at 6?h (135?±?32?pg/ml vs. 91?±?29?pg/ml, P?<?0.05) and S-100? at 1?h (1872?±?385?pg/ml vs. 1289?±?143?pg/ml, P?<?0.05. No significant post-operative change was detected in levels of TNF-α, IL-1, or CRP. Conclusion The serum levels of pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 and S-100? protein increased after total hip-replacement in elderly patients, and such increase may serve as predicting parameters for the occurrence of POCD.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of administering allogeneic blood products (ABP) on the progression of hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Sample population One hundred four dogs with hemangiosarcoma that survived until postoperative discharge from the hospital. Methods Medical records of dogs that had been operated on for hemoangiosarcoma were reviewed for signalment, presence of a hemoabdomen, presence of metastatic disease, and whether the dog had received chemotherapy or Yunnan Baiyao. Data that were collected were compared between dogs that received perioperative ABP and those that did not. Disease-free interval was compared between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain univariate descriptive statistics for time to clinical decline. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze association or effect of potential predictor variables. Results The median disease-free interval (DFI) was shorter in the 67 dogs that received a blood transfusion (76 days; range, 1-836) than in the 37 dogs that did not receive a blood transfusion (120 days; range, 38-916). According to the multivariable Cox regression model, administration of blood products (P?=?.04) and the presence of gross metastatic disease at the time of surgery (P?<?.01) shortened the DFI, whereas administration of Yunnan Baiyao (P?=?.01) prolonged the DFI. Conclusion Allogeneic blood product administration was associated with a shorter disease-free interval in this population. However, we could not demonstrate the association between blood products and shorter DFI because of confounding factors. Clinical significance Dogs that receive ABP at the time of surgical therapy for hemangiosarcoma may have accelerated disease progression compared with dogs that do not receive ABP.
