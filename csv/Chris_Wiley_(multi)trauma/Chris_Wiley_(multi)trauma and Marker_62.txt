AB  - Aim More than 26?000 Australians aged 12?24 years experience homelessness, yet data on the health status of homeless youth remain limited. The aim of this study was to describe the health of young people attending a youth health service in Western Sydney who were experiencing homelessness. Methods Retrospective case note review for clients aged 12?25 years attending Youth Health Services in Western Sydney. Extracted data included: homelessness status; demographics; physical health issues; mental health issues; involvement with juvenile justice; and disengagement from education or employment. Results Just under half of the 180 clients attending a Youth Health Service in Western Sydney were homeless, and an additional 15 young people who were not currently homeless nominated homelessness as a presenting issue. In comparison with currently domiciled young people, homeless youth were less likely to have a regular general practitioner and more likely to nominate a physical health concern as a presenting issue, although there was no difference between groups in terms of diagnosed mental or physical health conditions. Considered as a whole, the sample showed high rates of acute physical symptoms, physical trauma, psychological distress and self-harm. Conclusions Youth homelessness is associated with risk of both poor physical and mental health. As much of youth homelessness is hidden, health-care providers need to ensure that they inquire about homelessness status, and have an awareness of potentially complex multi-morbidities in the physical and mental health of young marginalised people presenting to health services.

AB  - Abstract The number of potential candidates for small bowel transplantation in the UK is unknown. Potential recipients are those with irreversible small intestinal failure, including those treated with permanent parenteral nutrition. This study of one of the largest groups of patients receiving such nutrition identified ten of 25 adult patients as possible recipients. The remaining 15 were considered unsuitable, mainly because of multiple previous abdominal operations or abscesses. Extrapolation of these data to national figures on the incidence of irreversible small intestinal failure suggests that each year up to 20 new adult patients in the UK might benefit from small bowel transplantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background? Biomedical markers may provide additive objective information in screening and confirmation of acute or recent consumption, intoxication, relapse, heavy drinking, hazardous/harmful use/abuse and dependence and alcohol use related organ dysfunction (alcohol use-related disorders: AUDs). Aims? To review the use of biomarkers in clinical practice to detect AUDs. Findings? About one-fifth of the patients seen in clinical practice have AUDs, which offer a variety of treatment options if diagnosed. The diagnosis of AUDs relies on clinical and alcohol-related history, physical examination, questionnaires and laboratory values. No clinical available laboratory test [e.g. for acute abuse: alcohol in blood or breath; for chronic alcohol abuse: ?-glutamyl transferase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT)] is reliable enough on its own to support a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, harmful use or abuse. Sensitivities, specificities and the predictive values may vary considerably according to patient and control group characteristics (e.g. gender, age or related comorbidity). In patient groups with limited cooperation markers may be helpful when considering treatment options. Conclusions? More research is needed to determine the value of markers (single or combined, with questionnaires) in the context of clinical decision-making algorithms in defined settings and with defined dichotomous outcome variables.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of administering allogeneic blood products (ABP) on the progression of hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Sample population One hundred four dogs with hemangiosarcoma that survived until postoperative discharge from the hospital. Methods Medical records of dogs that had been operated on for hemoangiosarcoma were reviewed for signalment, presence of a hemoabdomen, presence of metastatic disease, and whether the dog had received chemotherapy or Yunnan Baiyao. Data that were collected were compared between dogs that received perioperative ABP and those that did not. Disease-free interval was compared between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain univariate descriptive statistics for time to clinical decline. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze association or effect of potential predictor variables. Results The median disease-free interval (DFI) was shorter in the 67 dogs that received a blood transfusion (76 days; range, 1-836) than in the 37 dogs that did not receive a blood transfusion (120 days; range, 38-916). According to the multivariable Cox regression model, administration of blood products (P?=?.04) and the presence of gross metastatic disease at the time of surgery (P?<?.01) shortened the DFI, whereas administration of Yunnan Baiyao (P?=?.01) prolonged the DFI. Conclusion Allogeneic blood product administration was associated with a shorter disease-free interval in this population. However, we could not demonstrate the association between blood products and shorter DFI because of confounding factors. Clinical significance Dogs that receive ABP at the time of surgical therapy for hemangiosarcoma may have accelerated disease progression compared with dogs that do not receive ABP.

AB  - Aims:?To describe patterns and severity of caustic injuries sustained from dishwasher powder ingestion and highlight need for national safety standards. Methods:?Retrospective chart review of admissions for caustic ingestion to Starship Children's Hospital from January 2003 to January 2005 and review of New Zealand National Poisons Centre data. Results:?Between January 2003 and January 2005, the National Poisons Centre recorded 610 dishwashing powder ingestions, with 88% of children less than 2 years old. Twenty-three children were admitted to Starship Children's Hospital following caustic ingestion, of whom 11 were identified as having ingested dishwasher powder (9 boys and 2 girls) and were aged 11 to 30?months (mean 17.5). Five children (45%) were admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit over 4?months (October 2004 to January 2005), requiring intubation for airway control. Two children needed tracheostomy. Three of the 11 children (27%) required repeated oesophageal dilatation, and two underwent gastrostomy formation. One brand of dishwasher detergent and container type was implicated in over half of the cases. Conclusions:?Dishwasher detergents are highly corrosive substances that cause potentially life-threatening injuries and ongoing morbidity. The recent surge of incidents may be related to change in product constituents or non-compliance with New Zealand safety standards. Efforts to limit product alkalinity, legislative requirement of Child-Resistant Packaging and public education may reduce injuries from these common household substances.

AB  - ABSTRACT Fear of predation is a universal motivator. Because predators hunt using stealth and surprise, there is a widespread ability among prey to assess risk from chemical information ? scents ? in their environment. Consequently, scents often act as particularly strong modulators of memory and emotions. Recent advances in ecological research and analytical technology are leading to novel ways to use this chemical information to create effective attractants, repellents and anti-anxiolytic compounds for wildlife managers, conservation biologists and health practitioners. However, there is extensive variation in the design, results, and interpretation of studies of olfactory-based risk discrimination. To understand the highly variable literature in this area, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach and synthesize the latest findings from neurobiology, chemical ecology, and ethology to propose a contemporary framework that accounts for such disparate factors as the time-limited stability of chemicals, highly canalized mechanisms that influence prey responses, and the context within which these scents are detected (e.g. availability of alternative resources, perceived shelter, and ambient physical parameters). This framework helps to account for the wide range of reported responses by prey to predator scents, and explains, paradoxically, how the same individual predator scent can be interpreted as either safe or dangerous to a prey animal depending on how, when and where the cue was deposited. We provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the most common factors that influence how a predator scent (from dingoes, Canis dingo) may both attract and repel the same target organism (kangaroos, Macropus spp.). This framework identifies the catalysts that enable dynamic scents, odours or odorants to be used as attractants as well as deterrents. Because effective scent tools often relate to traumatic memories (fear and/or anxiety) that cause future avoidance, this information may also guide the development of appeasement, enrichment and anti-anxiolytic compounds, and help explain the observed variation in post-traumatic-related behaviours (including post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) among diverse terrestrial taxa, including humans.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Although multi-site pain is common in adolescents, pain conditions are frequently diagnosed and treated in isolation. Little is known about whether there are specific sites in which pain commonly co-occurs. This study examines the patterns of pain in adolescents, and whether these are associated with sports participation, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and sex. Methods In previously collected cohort data (?Adolescent Pain in Aalborg-2011?), adolescents (aged 12?19) completed an online questionnaire, including demographic data, current pain sites, sports participation and HRQoL (assessed by Euro-QoL 5D-3L). Latent class analysis was used to classify spatial pain patterns, based on the pain sites. The analysis included 2953 adolescents. Results Four classes were identified as follows: (1) little or no pain (63% of adolescents), (2) majority lower extremity pain (10%), (3) multi-site bodily pain (22%) and (4) head and stomach pain (3%). The lower extremity multi-site pain group reported highest weekly sports participation (p < 0.001; mean: 2.9 days/week; 95% CI 2.7 to 3.2), while the multi-site bodily pain and the multi-site head and stomach pain groups had lowest EQ-5D scores (p < 0.001). Males were more likely to belong to the little or no pain class, whereas females were more likely to belong to the multi-site bodily pain class. Conclusions Latent class analysis identified distinct classes of pain patterns in adolescents, characterized by sex, differences in HRQoL and sports participation. The class with multi-site bodily pain and reduced quality of life was the largest among adolescents reporting pain, and future research on treatment strategies should consider targeting this group.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

AB  - Abstract Objective The tissue response and biosafety of poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA) has been investigated to explore its potential use as an agent to straighten pre-curved cochlear implant electrode arrays for surgical insertion. Methods Test arrays were implanted either subcutaneously or into the cochlea of guinea pigs for 3 months. The arrays were uncoated (Treatment 1) or coated with low molecular weight (MW) PVA (Treatment 2), high MW PVA (Treatment 3) or a 50:50 mixture of low and high MW PVA (Treatment 4). After explantation the tissues were examined histologically. Results In both study groups, Treatment 2 dissolved completely and induced the least tissue reaction, while Treatments 3 and 4 not only dissolved incompletely, but also induced more fibrous tissue growth. Treatment 4 coated arrays induced severe insertion trauma in all the cochleas, most likely due to the thickness of the coat and the resulting rigidity of the array. Spiral ganglion cell density (SGCD) in the basal turn of the scala tympani was reduced for both Treatments 2 and 4. While the reduction in SGCD in the Treatment 4 group is likely to be a result of the insertion trauma caused and the subsequent loss of peripheral dendrites, it is unknown what caused the reduction of SGCD in the Treatment 2 group. Conclusion Prior to the specific use of PVA as electrode array coating material, the ideal composition and its biosafety needs to be reassessed. Copyright ? 2005 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRm) causes a disabling peripheral neuropathy as part of a multisystem disorder. The recent development of highly effective gene silencing therapies has highlighted the need for effective biomarkers of disease activity to guide the decision of when to start and stop treatment. In this study, we measured plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) concentration in 73 patients with ATTR and found that pNfL was significantly raised in ATTRm patients with peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, pNFL correlated with disease severity as defined by established clinical outcome measures in patients for whom this information was available. These findings suggest a potential role of pNfL in monitoring disease activity and progression in ATTRm patients.

AB  - Mental imagery may occur in any sensory modality, although visual imagery has been most studied. A sensitive measure of the vividness of imagery across a range of modalities is needed: the shorter version of Bett's Questionnaire upon Mental Imagery (Sheehan, , J. Clin. Psychology, 23, 386) uses outdated items and has an unreliable factor structure. We report the development and initial validation of the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (Psi-Q) comprising items for each of the following modalities: Vision, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Bodily Sensation, and Emotional Feeling. An exploratory factor analysis on a 35-item form indicated that these modalities formed separate factors, rather than a single imagery factor, and this was replicated by confirmatory factor analysis. The Psi-Q was validated against the Spontaneous Use of Imagery Scale (Reisberg et al., , Appl. Cogn. Psychology, 17, 147) and Marks' (, J. Mental Imagery, 19, 153) Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VVIQ-2). A short 21-item form comprising the best three items from the seven factors correlated with the total score and subscales of the full form, and with the VVIQ-2. Inspection of the data shows that while visual and sound imagery is most often rated as vivid, individuals who rate one modality as strong and the other as weak are not uncommon. Findings are interpreted within a working memory framework and point to the need for further research to identify the specific cognitive processes underlying the vividness of imagery across sensory modalities.

AB  - Abstract Background information Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell?cell and cell?matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6?12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Results Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. Conclusions We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: The recovery quality scoring systems (RQSSs) in current use have not been critically reviewed for reliability. Objective: To examine reliability (reproducibility) of 4 RQSSs when applied to a ranked series. Methods: A DVD incorporating the recordings of 9 horses recovering from general anaesthesia was evaluated by final year students over 5 days. On Day 1, each evaluator ranked recoveries from 1?9 (1 = best). Over the following 4 days, each evaluator scored the same recoveries using 4 different RQSSs (3 of them in common usage and previously published) applied in random order. The scores from each RQSS were ranked and plotted against the Day 1 ranking of each evaluator to establish the extent of agreement using generalisability theory. The same 9 recoveries were also ranked by 12 experienced equine anaesthetists and the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient calculated to determine the agreement between experienced and inexperienced evaluators. Results: The recoveries were evaluated by 117 students. All 4 RQSSs were equally reliable with low (<4%) interobserver variability. The main (80%) source of total variation arose from differences between horses. The overall ranking within each RQSS was strongly correlated with Day 1 ranking. There was strong correlation (r = 0.983) between the students' ranking and that established by experienced anaesthetists. Interobserver reliability was similar with all 4 RQSSs. Conclusion: All 4 RQSSs studied were similarly reliable. Potential relevance: The selection of a universally acceptable RQSS from amongst the 4 examined can be based on criteria other than reliability, e.g. ease of use. This will facilitate wider scale multi-centre studies in recovery quality after anaesthesia in horses.

AB  - Summary As the survival rate of the intestinal and multi-visceral transplant recipients continues to improve, an increasing number of these patients present for either elective or emergency surgery related or unrelated to transplantation. The aim of this review is to focus on clinical issues related to the anesthetic and perioperative management of the intestinal or multi-visceral transplant recipient for nontransplant surgery. Specific issues concerning perioperative assessment and medications, choice of anesthetic drugs and techniques, and postoperative care management are reviewed.

AB  - Objective: To determine response to treatment, survival and prognostic factors for feline extranodal lymphoma in the UK. Methods: Records of cats diagnosed with lymphoma of extranodal sites at seven referral centres were reviewed and information on signalment, tumour location, prior treatment and chemotherapy protocol recorded. Factors influencing response to treatment and survival were assessed. Results: One hundred and forty-nine cases met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine cats had nasal lymphoma, 35 renal, 15 central nervous system, 11 laryngeal and 19 miscellaneous locations. Sixty-six cats received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, 25 Wisconsin-Madison doxorubicin-containing multi-agent protocol, 10 prednisolone alone and nine other combinations. The response rate for the 110 treated cats was 85·5 per cent. Of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone treated cats 72·7 per cent achieved complete remission, median survival 239 days. Sixty-four per cent of Wisconsin-Madison treated cats achieved complete remission, median survival 563 days. Cats with nasal lymphoma achieving complete remission had the longest survival (749 days) and cats with central nervous system lymphoma the shortest (70 days). If complete remission was achieved, prior treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduced survival time. Clinical Significance: Cats with extranodal lymphoma respond to chemotherapy and achieve survival times comparable to other locations. Corticosteroid pretreatment reduced survival time in cats achieving complete remission.
