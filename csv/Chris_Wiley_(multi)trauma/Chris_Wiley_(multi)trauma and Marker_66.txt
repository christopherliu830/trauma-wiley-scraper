AB  - Abstract The diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of lower extremity amputation worldwide and is directly associated with comorbidity, disability and mortality. Oxidative stress mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these wounds. Intra-lesional infiltration of epidermal growth factor has emerged as a potential therapeutic alternative to allow for physiological benefit while avoiding the proteolytic environment at the centre of the wound. The aim of this study was to characterise the response of patients with DFUs to epidermal growth factor treatment in terms of redox status markers. Experimental groups included patients with DFUs before and 3?4 weeks after starting treatment with epidermal growth factor; compensated and non-compensated diabetic patients without ulcers; and age-matched non-diabetic subjects. Evaluations comprised serum levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Patients with DFUs exhibited the most disheveled biochemical profile, with elevated oxidative stress and low antioxidant reserves, with respect to non-ulcerated diabetic patients and to non-diabetic subjects. Epidermal growth factor intra-lesional administration was associated with a significant recovery of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Altogether, our results indicate that epidermal growth factor intra-ulcer therapy contributes to restore systemic redox balance in patients with DFUs.

AB  - Focal metatarsal sinus tracts (?fistulation?) are, to the authors knowledge, reported for the first time in a Weimaraner. The six-year-old, entire male had a five-month history of two symmetrical, well-demarcated sinuses on the plantar aspect of each metatarsus. The area surrounding each pair of sinuses was slightly fluctuant and a serosanguineous discharge could be expressed. Cytological examination of the discharge was characteristic of pyogranulomatous inflammation. Bacterial culture showed the material to be sterile. Examination of a skin biopsy revealed a severe inflammatory reaction involving the dermal collagen, with an infiltrate of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and multi-nucleated giant cells, with some micro-pustule formation. Treatment with ciclosporin induced total remission. Reduction of the dose of ciclosporin resulted in recurrence of the physical signs with further remission on re-introduction of the original dosage. This is the first report of the use of ciclosporin to control this condition.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the impact of the Australian National Emergency Access Target (NEAT) policy introduced in 2012 on ED performance. Methods A longitudinal cohort study of NEAT implementation using linked data, for 12 EDs across New South Wales (NSW), Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Queensland (QLD) between 2008 and 2013. Segmented regression in a multi-level model was used to analyse ED performance over time before and after NEAT introduction. The main outcomes measures were ED length of stay ≤4 h, access block, number of ED presentations, short-stay admission (≤24?h), >24?h admissions, unplanned ED re-attendances within 7 days and ?left at own risk? (including ?did not wait for assessment?). Results Two years after NEAT introduction, ED length of stay ≤4 h increased in NSW and QLD (odds ratio [OR]?=?2.48 and 3.24; P?<?0.001) and access block decreased (OR = 0.41 and 0.22; P?<?0.001), but not in ACT (OR?=?1.28; P?>?0.05). ED presentations increased over time before and after NEAT introduction with a significant increase above the projected trend in NSW after NEAT (mean ratio?=?1.07). Short-stay admissions increased in QLD (OR?= 2.60), ACT (OR?=?1.68) and NSW (OR?=?1.35). Unplanned ED re-attendances did not change significantly. Those who left at their own risk decreased significantly in NSW and QLD (OR?=?0.38 and 0.67). Conclusion ED presentations continued to increase over time in all jurisdictions. NSW and QLD, but not ACT, showed significant improvements in time-based measures. Significant increases in short-stay admissions suggest a strategic change in ED process associated with NEAT implementation. Rates of unplanned ED re-attendances and those leaving at their own risk showed no evidence for adverse effects from NEAT.

AB  - This study examines the impact of children?s exposure to natural disaster against the backdrop of exposure to other traumatic events and psychosocial risks. One thousand three hundred ninety-eight Sri Lankan children aged 9?15?years were interviewed in 4 cross-sectional studies about exposure to traumatic life events related to the war, the tsunami experience, and family violence. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, somatic complaints, psychosocial functioning, and teacher reports of school grades served as outcome measures. A global outcome variable of ?positive adaptation? was created from a combination of these measures. Data showed extensive exposure to adversity and traumatic events among children in Sri Lanka. Findings of regression analyses indicated that all 3 event types?tsunami and disaster, war, and family violence?significantly contributed to poorer child adaptation.

AB  - Abstract Evidence indicated that GATA5 may suppress hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell malignant transformation, but the mechanism of how GATA5 affects cancer cell reprogramming to inhibit HCC malignant behaviour is still unclear. In this study, we report that the expression of ?-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. In contrast, the expression of GATA5 was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. Transfection of CDH-GATA5 vectors into HCC cells (HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells) increased the GATA5 expression and decreased the expression of ?-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM. Increased GATA5 expression by transfection with its expression vectors was also able to inhibit the cell growth, colony formation and capability of migration, invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. Results revealed that GATA5 co-localization with ?-catenin in the cytoplasm, preventing ?-catenin from entering the nucleus. Treatment with the specific Wnt/?-catenin pathway inhibitor salinomycin was able to reduce the expression of ?-catenin and reprogramming genes. Salinomycin exerted a similar influence as GATA5, and siRNA-GATA5 restored ?-catenin and reprogramming gene expression. This study demonstrates that an increase in the expression of GATA5 inhibits the expression of ?-catenin and reprogramming genes and suppresses tumour growth, colony formation, metastasis and invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. The mechanism of GATA5 inhibiting the malignant behaviours of HCC cells may involve in the disruption of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway and the reduction of reprogramming gene expression.

AB  - Background Multiple scoring systems are used in the assessment of post-injury outcomes in pelvic fracture patients. Although commonly used, there is scarce evidence as to their validity. Methods We performed a systematic review of the current literature to compare a well validated generic outcome tool (Short Form-36 (SF-36)) and three commonly used pelvic-specific outcome tools, the Iowa Pelvic Score, Majeed Pelvic Score and Orlando Pelvic Score. Results Eleven papers were found that used both the SF-36 and one or more of the pelvic-specific outcome tools. The data demonstrate great variability in both the method of application and form of reporting. Conclusion The pelvic-specific tools produce similar results to the SF-36 and are potentially more sensitive in examining specific areas related to pelvic injuries and easier to perform and calculate than the SF-36.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Abstract Modern communities affiliated with the same culture have been shown to experience comparable levels of interpersonal violence, no matter what their size. It was hypothesized that a similar relationship would exist among ancient rural and urban people, but that accident-related trauma may be more prominent among rural dwellers due to their activity base. Through an analysis of antemortem trauma, this investigation contrasted the injury profile of Nubian adult villagers (N = 55) from the Kerma period (2500?1750 BC) to that of their urban neighbors (N = 223) at Kerma (2050?1500 BC). The injury pattern associated with interpersonal violence (cranial injury, direct-force ulna fractures, and multiple injuries) was similar between the two samples, as hypothesized. The rural group sustained significantly more nonviolence-related injuries that suggested occupational or environmental influences. The more severe cranial injuries observed among urban people are attributed to a preference for more lethal hand-wielded objects that may have accompanied increasing local tensions and incursions into Egypt during the 17th Dynasty.

AB  - The SCORE (Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation) is a 40-item questionnaire for completion by family members 12 years and older to assess outcome in systemic therapy. Twenty-eight and 15-item short versions of the SCORE have previously been validated with samples containing some families attending adult mental health services and some attending child and adolescent services; or samples containing families exclusively from child and adolescent services. This study aimed to investigate psychometric properties of two short versions of the SCORE with a sample drawn exclusively from adult mental health services. Data were collected from 199 service users attending inpatient and outpatient adult mental health services in the south-east of Ireland. Both instruments had good internal consistency reliability. They also showed construct and criterion validity, correlating with measures of global functioning, service need, and childhood trauma. The 28 and 15-item versions of the SCORE are brief psychometrically robust family assessment instruments which may be used to evaluate systemic therapy with adult mental health service users. Practitioner points Brief 15 and 28-item versions of the SCORE may be used to assess family adjustment, monitor progress and assess outcome in adult mental health cases The SCORE-28 is in the appendix to Cahill et al. (). The SCORE-15 and a 29-item version that contains items for both the SCORE-28 and SCORE-15 is in Fay et al.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, there has been increasing demand for personalized anatomy modelling for medical and industrial applications, such as ergonomics device development, clinical radiological exposure simulation, biomechanics analysis, and 3D animation character design. In this study, we constructed deformable torso phantoms that can be deformed to match the personal anatomy of Chinese male and female adults. The phantoms were created based on a training set of 79 trunk computed tomography (CT) images (41 males and 38 females) from normal Chinese subjects. Major torso organs were segmented from the CT images, and the statistical shape model (SSM) approach was used to learn the inter-subject anatomical variations. To match the personal anatomy, the phantoms were registered to individual body surface scans or medical images using the active shape model method. The constructed SSM demonstrated anatomical variations in body height, fat quantity, respiratory status, organ geometry, male muscle size, and female breast size. The masses of the deformed phantom organs were consistent with Chinese population organ mass ranges. To validate the performance of personal anatomy modelling, the phantoms were registered to the body surface scan and CT images. The registration accuracy measured from 22 test CT images showed a median Dice coefficient over 0.85, a median volume recovery coefficient (RCvlm) between 0.85 and 1.1, and a median averaged surface distance (ASD) < 1.5 mm. We hope these phantoms can serve as computational tools for personalized anatomy modelling for the research community.

Study Design Observational study and prospective case series. Animals Normal dogs (n = 5) and dogs with chylothorax (n = 8). Methods A single paracostal approach with transdiaphragmatic extension for TDL and CCA was developed experimentally (n = 5) and used in 8 clinical cases with subtotal pericardectomy (SPE) performed in 4 dogs. Surgery time, complications, hospitalization time, outcome, and follow-up of clinical cases were recorded. Results Exposure of relevant anatomy was excellent; vital lymphatic staining facilitated identification of lymphatic structures. In clinical cases, mean surgery time for TDL + CCA was 136 minutes. Mean hospitalization time was 3.1 days. Seven of 8 cases survived, with 1 dog dying of heart failure shortly after discharge. One dog required a second (left) paracostal approach to ligate 2 more lymphatic vessels. On follow-up (median, 7 months; range, 2?20 months), there was complete resolution of chylothorax in 6 dogs. Conclusions A single paracostal approach provides excellent exposure of cisterna chyli, caudal thoracic duct, and intestinal lymphatics. This approach eliminates the need for repositioning during combined TDL + CCA procedures and avoids an intercostal thoracotomy.

AB  - Abstract Translocator protein (TSPO) expression is increased in activated glia, and has been used as a marker of neuroinflammation in PET imaging. However, the extent to which TSPO upregulation reflects a pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether TSPO upregulation in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages is limited to a specific inflammatory phenotype. TSPO upregulation was assessed by flow cytometry in cultured astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or interleukin-4 (Il-4). Subsequently, mice were injected intracerebrally with either a TNF-inducing adenovirus (AdTNF) or IL-4. Glial expression of TSPO and pro-/anti-inflammatory markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence and flow cytometry. Finally, AdTNF or IL-4 injected mice underwent PET imaging with injection of the TSPO radioligand 18F-DPA-713, followed by ex vivo autoradiography. TSPO expression was significantly increased in pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages and astrocytes both in vitro, and in vivo after AdTNF injection (p?<?.001 vs. control hemisphere), determined both histologically and by FACS. Both PET imaging and autoradiography revealed a significant (p?<?.001) increase in 18F-DPA-713 binding in the ipsilateral hemisphere of AdTNF-injected mice. In contrast, no increase in either TSPO expression assessed histologically and by FACS, or ligand binding by PET/autoradiography was observed after IL-4 injection. Taken together, these results suggest that TSPO imaging specifically reveals the pro-inflammatory population of activated glial cells in the brain in response to inflammatory stimuli. Since the inflammatory phenotype of glial cells is critical to their role in neurological disease, these findings may enhance the utility and application of TSPO imaging.

AB  - Abstract In an effort to identify tumor-associated proteins from plasma of tumor-bearing mice that may be used as diagnostic biomarkers, we developed a strategy that combines a tumor xenotransplantation model in nude mice with comparative proteomic technology. Five human cancer cell lines (SC-M1, HONE-1, CC-M1, OECM1, GBM 8401) derived from stomach, nasopharyngeal, colon, oral and brain cancers were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice and compared to control nude mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline. One month later, plasma from mice inoculated with cancer cells was collected for proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Comparison of plasma 2-DE maps from tumor-bearing mice with those produced from control mice revealed the overexpression of several mouse acute phase proteins (APPs) such as haptoglobin. Another APP, serum amyloid A (SAA), was found only in mice bearing tumors induced by the stomach cancer cell line SC-M1, which has not previously been demonstrated in xenotransplatation experiment. Furthermore, by using immunohistochemistry, SAA and haptoglobin were found to originate from the mouse hosts and not from the human cancer cell line donors. The protein alterations were further confirmed on patients with stomach cancers where up-regulated levels of SAA were also observed. These results indicate that APPs may be used as nonspecific tumor-associated serum markers. SAA in particular may serve as a potential marker for detecting stomach cancer. Taken together, the combination of the xenotransplatation model in nude mice and proteomics analysis provided a valuable impact for clinical applications in cancer diagnostics. In addition, our findings demonstrate that a panel of APPs might serve as screening biomarkers for early cancer detection.

AB  - The quality of attachment between intimate partners is important for women to maintain healthy relationships. Yet, the quality of attachment style and relationship can be marred and disrupted in women exposed to trauma due to intimate partner violence (IPV). Research suggests that the impact of trauma on women can be transmitted over generations due to the inability to regulate emotions, specifically in dealing with their children. The aim of this study was to explore the disruption of adult attachment patterns by comparing a group of women in Indonesia who have been affected by IPV, and a group of women who have not been affected by IPV but who have been separated from their partner during military duty. A cross-sectional study comparing two groups: women exposed to IPV (n = 35) and women not exposed to IPV (n = 35) was carried out. The adult attachment scale before and after marriage was obtained using Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised scales. The results revealed a significant shift of attachment style on the Avoidant dimension of the non-IPV group separated by partner military duty and a slight change on the overall attachment of the IPV group, but relative stability on the Anxiety dimensions. The study interpreted the findings as being more supportive of the prototype perspective rather than the revisionist perspective. Family therapists may reduce the attachment Avoidant dimension as a therapeutic goal of intervention to change the insecure to a more secure working model.

AB  - Abstract Delayed bone healing and non-union occur in approximately 10% of long bone fractures. Despite intense investigations and progress in understanding the processes governing bone healing, the specific pathophysiological characteristics of the local microenvironment leading to non-union remain obscure. The clinical findings and radiographic features remain the two important landmarks of diagnosing non-unions and even when the diagnosis is established there is debate on the ideal timing and mode of intervention. In an attempt to understand better the pathophysiological processes involved in the development of fracture non-union, a number of studies have endeavoured to investigate the biological profile of tissue obtained from the non-union site and analyse any differences or similarities of tissue obtained from different types of non-unions. In the herein study, we present the existing evidence of the biological and molecular profile of fracture non-union tissue.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract Psychological distress, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and psychological trauma, is common in women living in inner cities and can be associated with disturbed sleep. The purposes of the study of 115 women were to examine: (a) objective and subjective sleep patterns; (b) extent of psychological distress; and (c) the relationship between objective and subjective sleep patterns and psychological distress. Wrist actigraphs were worn. High levels of life stress, sleep pattern disturbance, and psychological distress were common. Self-reported sleep patterns, but not objective sleep pattern variables, explained 12.5% to 44% of the variance in psychological distress, suggesting the importance of screening for sleep and psychological distress. These findings suggest that interventions focusing on sleep or psychological distress may reduce symptoms. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 32:177?190, 2009

AB  - Key Points Vascular dysfunction at the level of the brachial artery after transradial cardiac catheterization appears transient and resolves within a week Chemo-toxicity from procedural cocktails in addition to catheter-mediated barotrauma directly to the brachial artery or indirectly from radial trauma may play a role in its etiology. Further work is needed to better define the causes of vascular damage from the transradial procedures to develop safer techniques for the future.

AB  - ABSTRACT Of the various virulence mechanisms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type III secretion system (TTSS) has been characterized as a major factor associated with acute lung injury, bacteremia and mortality. In addition, PcrV, a component protein of the TTSS, has been characterized as a protective antigen against infection with P. aeruginosa. This study comprised an epidemiological analysis of serum anti-PcrV titers in a cohort of Japanese adults. From April 2012 to March 2013, serum anti-PcrV titers of 198 volunteer participants undergoing anesthesia for scheduled surgeries were measured. The median, minimum and maximum serum anti-PcrV titers among the 198 participants were 4.09?nM, 1.01?nM and 113.81?nM, respectively. The maximum peaks in the histogram were within the anti-PcrV 2.00?4.99?nM titer range; values for 115 participants (58.1%) were within this range. Anti-PcrV titers were more than approximately three-fold greater (>12?nM) than the median value in 21 participants (10.6%). Ten-year interval age increases, history of treatment for traffic trauma, and a history of past surgery each showed statistically significant associations with higher anti-PcrV titers (i.e., >10?nM) than did the other factors assessed by binomial analysis. This study revealed a considerable variation in anti-PcrV titers in adult subjects without any obvious histories of infection with P. aeruginosa.
