AB  - ABSTRACT Of the various virulence mechanisms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type III secretion system (TTSS) has been characterized as a major factor associated with acute lung injury, bacteremia and mortality. In addition, PcrV, a component protein of the TTSS, has been characterized as a protective antigen against infection with P. aeruginosa. This study comprised an epidemiological analysis of serum anti-PcrV titers in a cohort of Japanese adults. From April 2012 to March 2013, serum anti-PcrV titers of 198 volunteer participants undergoing anesthesia for scheduled surgeries were measured. The median, minimum and maximum serum anti-PcrV titers among the 198 participants were 4.09?nM, 1.01?nM and 113.81?nM, respectively. The maximum peaks in the histogram were within the anti-PcrV 2.00?4.99?nM titer range; values for 115 participants (58.1%) were within this range. Anti-PcrV titers were more than approximately three-fold greater (>12?nM) than the median value in 21 participants (10.6%). Ten-year interval age increases, history of treatment for traffic trauma, and a history of past surgery each showed statistically significant associations with higher anti-PcrV titers (i.e., >10?nM) than did the other factors assessed by binomial analysis. This study revealed a considerable variation in anti-PcrV titers in adult subjects without any obvious histories of infection with P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Abstract Psychological distress, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and psychological trauma, is common in women living in inner cities and can be associated with disturbed sleep. The purposes of the study of 115 women were to examine: (a) objective and subjective sleep patterns; (b) extent of psychological distress; and (c) the relationship between objective and subjective sleep patterns and psychological distress. Wrist actigraphs were worn. High levels of life stress, sleep pattern disturbance, and psychological distress were common. Self-reported sleep patterns, but not objective sleep pattern variables, explained 12.5% to 44% of the variance in psychological distress, suggesting the importance of screening for sleep and psychological distress. These findings suggest that interventions focusing on sleep or psychological distress may reduce symptoms. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 32:177?190, 2009

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses the nature of disability, how it can best be ameliorated, which training techniques and medical treatments are most effective, particularly after single incident brain injury, and the organisational structures required for their optimal delivery. A holistic biopsychosocial individualised multi-dimensional rehabilitation programme includes: reiterative multi-disciplinary assessment, problem definition and measurement, goal-setting and treatment planning, treatment delivery, evaluation of effectiveness, and reassessment with a view to further treatment. Non-invasive therapy interventions and task-related training in the context of neural damage are an integral part of the rehabilitation process after a neurological event, and aim to optimise a person's functional ability. Cardio-respiratory training and exercise classes may reverse the detraining effects of immobility and reduced activity seen in many chronic conditions. Symptoms related to neurological impairments caused by either single incident or chronic progressive conditions can cause distress and impact on function.

AB  - Abstract Background Fibrosis, a proliferative response of fibrocytes after tissue injury, is a common sequela of external radiotherapy and can vary greatly among patients even in the absence of DNA repair syndromes, due to their different intrinsic radiosensitivity. Fibrosis is also a serious cosmetic problem for patients, and in some cases it can also imply pain. Case Here, we report a case of a severe fibrosis 2 years after breast conserving surgery and postoperative 3D conformal breast irradiation. Furthermore, our patient had the suspicion of tumour recurrence. Our examinations were aimed at diagnosing recurrence or the lack of recurrence and investigating whether the symptoms occurred due to overdosing or extreme intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore, examining the patients' radiosensitivity, a cytogenetic test was performed, which revealed the patient's increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation, and therefore we rejected the prospect of overdosage. As a solution for the fibrosis, mastectomy was effectuated, and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used for reconstruction. Conclusions We suggest a multi-disciplinary approach to manage fibrosis and propose cytogenetic markers to be used as predictors to identify patients who most likely benefit from a certain therapeutic regimen in terms of reduction of therapy-related side effects.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Vasculogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels from embryonic precursor cells. The formation of additional vessels is called angiogenesis, the sprouting from pre-existing vessels by migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells. Until recently vasculogenesis was considered to be restricted to embryogenesis, however, evidence suggests that progenitor cells exist in the adult, able to participate in neovascularization. In order to study cellular and molecular control mechanisms without animal testing we have established in featuring the three-dimensional formation of capillary-like structures from microvascular endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to identify the specific subpopulation of cells that triggers the primary process of vasculogenesis in vitro. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells were isolated from the bovine corpus luteum and examined by phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy. Immunolabelling was done for the most important pro-angiogenic factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors (VEGF-R1, -R2) as well as for endothelial cell surface markers (CD 31, CD51/61, CD29) and presumptive stem cell marker CD 34. Additionally VEGF and VEGF-R1, -R2 expression was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results:? The beginning of vessel formation in vitro was initiated by confluence of endothelial cells. A linear and circular side-by-side arrangement of cells and the formation of capillary-like structures with an internal lumen could be observed. Specific clusters of cells were identified. These cells were arranged in a star-like formation, i.e., one particular round cell in the centre surrounded by several cells with extensions. Immunolocalization of VEGF, VEGF-R1, -R2, CD 31, CD51/61, CD29 and CD34 was positive. VEGF-R2 and CD 34 were found to be co-localized in specific cells exclusively. Conclusions:? Results for the first time reveal the specific subpopulation of endothelial cells that trigger the start of vasculogenesis in vitro. These progenitor cells are characterized by a specific morphology, by the presence of endothelial cell markers and by the expression of stem cell marker in vitro models

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurological function and, depending upon the severity of injury, may lead to paralysis. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 ?g 17?-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).

AB  - Abstract The last decade has seen the rapid development of untethered mobile micro- and nanorobots able to navigate liquids by means of external power sources or by harvesting chemicals from their surrounding media. These tiny devices hold great promise for applications in the biomedical field including targeted drug delivery, localized diagnostics, microsurgery, and cell stimulation. However, to translate small-scale robots from the laboratory to the clinic, many challenges remain. A major obstacle is the lack of imaging technologies that will allow for precise tracking of the devices in vivo. Here, the current progress, challenges, and future possibilities in the monitoring and tracking of biomedical micro- and nanomachines using established as well as less conventional imaging technologies are reviewed.

AB  - Abstract The hemophilias are a group of disorders associated with a chronic burden of morbidity and early mortality. Improvements in these adverse features have been achieved by the use of clotting factor concentrates within comprehensive centers of specialized care providing home infusion programs. Offsetting effects from transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and HIV infection are in recent decline. The net impact of these changes merits assessment. To test the a priori hypotheses that increasing severity of factor VIII deficiency would be associated with an increasing burden or morbidity and that hepatitis and HIV positivity would impair health status further, a cross-sectional study of a population-based cohort was undertaken in a regional hemophilia program in Ontario, Canada. A survey was made of mild, moderate, and severe hemophiliacs over 13 years of age who self-reported their health status using a standard 15-item questionnaire. The responses were converted to levels in the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) health status classification systems to form multi-element vectors from which single-attribute morbidity and overall health-related quality of life utility scores were determined. The burden of morbidity was greater in hemophiliacs than in the general population and correlated with the category of disease (mild < moderate < severe). Hepatitis and HIV positivity conferred additional burdens of morbidity, which were mainly in the attributes of mobility (HUI2), ambulation (HUI3), and pain (HUI2/3), all of these differences reaching levels of statistical significance. Despite demonstrable improvements in the safety, effectiveness, and utilization of clotting factor concentrates, hemophiliacs continue to experience an important burden of morbidity. Measurement of this burden, as reported here, provides a basis for future economic evaluation of the costs and consequences of health care interventions provided to this population. Am. J.

AB  - Summary Head protective tools such as helmets and faceshields can induce a localized high pressure region on the skull because of the underwash of the blast waves. Whether this underwash overpressure can affect the brain tissue response is still unknown. Accordingly, a computational approach was taken to confirm the incidence of underwash with regards to blast direction, as well as examine the influence of this effect on the mechanical responses of the brain. The variation of intracranial pressure (ICP) as one of the major injury predictors, as well as the maximum shear stress were mainly addressed in this study. Using a nonlinear finite element (FE) approach, generation and interaction of blast waves with the unprotected, helmeted, and fully protected (helmet and faceshield protected) FE head models were modeled using a multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian?Eulerian (ALE) method and a fluid?structure interaction (FSI) coupling algorithm. The underwash incidence overpressure was found to greatly change with the blast direction. Moreover, while underwash induced ICP (U-ICP) did not exceed the peak ICP of the unprotected head, it was comparable and even more than the peak ICP imposed on the protected heads by the primary shockwaves (Coup-ICP). It was concluded that while both helmet and faceshield protected the head against blast waves, the underwash overpressure affected the brain tissue response and altered the dynamic load experienced by the brain as it led to increased ICP levels at the countercoup site, imparted elevated skull flexure, and induced high negative pressure regions.

Conclusion and future directions Abstract Since the first cell therapeutic study to repair articular cartilage defects in the knee in 1994, several clinical studies have been reported. An overview of the results of clinical studies did not conclusively show improvement over conventional methods, mainly because few studies reach level I of evidence for effects on middle or long term. However, these explorative trials have provided valuable information about study design, mechanisms of repair and clinical outcome and have revealed that much is still unknown and further improvements are required. Furthermore, cellular and molecular studies using new technologies such as cell tracking, gene arrays and proteomics have provided more insight in the cell biology and mechanisms of joint surface regeneration. Besides articular cartilage, cartilage of other anatomical locations as well as progenitor cells are now considered as alternative cell sources. Growth Factor research has revealed some information on optimal conditions to support cartilage repair. Thus, there is hope for improvement. In order to obtain more robust and reproducible results, more detailed information is needed on many aspects including the fate of the cells, choice of cell type and culture parameters. As for the clinical aspects, it becomes clear that careful selection of patient groups is an important input parameter that should be optimized for each application. In addition, the study outcome parameters should be improved. Although reduced pain and improved function are, from the patient's perspective, the most important outcomes, there is a need for more structure/tissue-related outcome measures. Ideally, criteria and/or markers to identify patients at risk and responders to treatment are the ultimate goal for these more sophisticated regenerative approaches in joint surface repair in particular, and regenerative medicine in general.

AB  - An art work that refuses the boundaries of word and image, image and music, that was made in defiance of art history's preferred models of style, movement and period, Charlotte Salomon's vast interdisciplinary project Leben? oder Theater? (1941?42) challenges art history but responds well to models of feminist reading of visual narrative and semiotics proposed by Mieke Bal's practice of cultural analysis and working with concepts. Viewed since its belated discovery as a largely autobiographical text, Charlotte Salomon's huge work is here examined through the lens of two concepts: Benjamin's ?theatre of memory? and Braccha Ettinger's idea of ?art working?. Taking seriously the interrogative form of the title, the article asks both how an art work can be an investigation and what this art work was questioning. Close reading of key images that explore the inner worlds of three women that form a counter series to the overt narrative sequence of the final text, the text is analytically ?listened to? in order to plot out the nature of the questions it poses about life, death, creativity through a memorial restaging of the lives and deaths of four women and one man. Focusing on the visual strategies in the paintings, the visual and acoustic leitmotifs that pictorially define the major ?players?, and tracing the semiotic and affective freight of the colour blue, the article examines the journey the work performed for the artist through the prism of Ettinger's proposal about ?art as a transport station of trauma? that might open up to trans-subjective border space in which the trauma of loss can be encountered and worked through.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To evaluate the time of onset, overall efficacy, and safety of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for noncancer-related breakthrough pain (BTP) in opioid-tolerant adults over 12 weeks. Design.? A novel 12-week study that mimicked clinical practice with dose titration to effective dose, open-label treatment, and three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-crossover periods at weeks 4, 8, and 12. For each double-blind period, study patients received nine doses (FBT?=?6, placebo?=?3) in a randomized sequence. Setting.? Twenty-one study centers in the United States. Population. Opioid-tolerant adults with noncancer-related chronic pain and BTP. Outcome Measures.? The primary outcome was the sum of the pain intensity differences (PID) 5?60 minutes post dose (SPID60) during the final double-blind period. Secondary outcomes included pain relief (PR), meaningful PR, and proportion of episodes with a PID of ≥33% and ≥50%. Results.? Of 148 patients who entered the titration phase, 105 (71%) achieved a successful dose and 81 (55%) participated in all three assessment periods in the study. The final RCT assessment period results demonstrated continued efficacy of FBT vs placebo (P?<?0.05) for SPID60 (mean [SD]: 7.7 [6.2] vs 4.6 [4.7]). The average onset of PR began at 5 minutes, with meaningful PR by ≤10 minutes. The proportion of episodes with ≥33% improvement in PI was 7% with FBT vs 3% with placebo at 5 minutes and with ≥50% was 17% vs 10% at 15 minutes. All periods showed similar results. Adverse events and patient discontinuations were generally typical of clinical opioid use. Conclusions.? FBT showed continued clinically important analgesic effects and was generally well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Government policies sanctioning the systematic removal of Australian Aboriginal children from their families ended in the 1970s. However, trauma associated with removal remains active in the present day for those removed and their offspring, contributing to the pernicious interlinked set of health and social problems afflicting most Aboriginal communities. Child abuse and neglect are an important avenue of inter-generational transmission of trauma leaving many Aboriginal children challenge-averse and vulnerable to social disadvantage, substance abuse and mental health problems in later life. Child protection and health services have a poor record engaging and providing effective interventions to Aboriginal Australians. Sunset Surfers is a learn-to-surf programme targeting a disadvantaged urban neighbourhood with a high proportion of Aboriginal families. Qualitative evaluation shows that participants experienced positive effect associated with the challenging activity of learning to surf, allowing for reframing of children's negative beliefs about challenge. By providing an appropriate balance of challenge and support, and encouraging physical activity, Sunset Surfers represents a holistic, preventative approach to a pernicious array of social and health problems.

AB  - Objectives Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) are both involved in the restructuring of connective tissues. Evidence also implicates MMP9 and sICAM in cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases, where blood levels may be a marker of disease severity or prognosis. In individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), higher risk for cardiovascular illness has been extensively reported. Methods The aim of this investigation was to measure and compare peripheral levels of serum MMP9 and sICAM in adults with euthymic BD and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we focussed on correlations with illness severity and metabolic parameters. Results MMP9 levels among the BD sample (n = 112) were significantly higher than among the HC (n = 80) (MMP9: F = 9.885, p = 0.002, ?2 = 0.058) after controlling for confounding factors. Patients with BD in a later, progressive stage of disease showed significantly higher MMP9 as well as sICAM-1 levels compared to patients with BD in an earlier stage of disease (MMP9: F = 5.8, p = 0.018, ?2 = 0.054; sICAM-1: F = 5.6, p = 0.020, ?2 = 0.052). Correlation analyses of cognitive measures revealed a negative association between performance on the d2 Test of Attention and MMP9 (r = ?0.287, p = 0.018) in the BD sample. Despite the sample being euthymic (i.e., according to conventional criteria) at the time of analysis, we found significant correlations between MMP9 as well as sICAM-1 and subthreshold depressive/hypomanic symptoms. Conclusions A collection of disparate findings herein point to a role of MMP9 and cICAM-1 in the patho-progressive process of BD: the increased levels of serum MMP9 and sICAM-1, the correlation between higher levels of these parameters, progressive stage, and cognitive dysfunction in BD, and the positive correlation with subthreshold symptoms. As sICAM-1 and MMP9 are reliable biomarkers of inflammatory and early atherosclerotic disease, these markers may provide indications of the presence of occult cardiovascular disease in this highly at-risk population.

AB  - Abstract This study used confirmatory factor analysis to examine the factor structure of the Cambodian version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire in 488 Cambodian refugees residing in the United States. Five alternative conceptual models were compared. A model with four correlated factors reflecting symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal provided the best fit to these data. The avoidance and emotional numbing clusters demonstrated distinct associations with depression symptoms, providing some evidence of the construct validity of the four-factor solution.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.
