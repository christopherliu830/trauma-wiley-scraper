AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - ABSTRACT The hippocampus is known to play a vital role in learning and memory and was demonstrated as an early imaging marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its role as a predictor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia following stroke is unclear. The main purpose of this study was to examine the associations between hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity (MD) and connectivity and cognitive state following stroke. Eighty three consecutive first ever mild to moderate stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors from our ongoing prospective TABASCO (Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans within 7 days of stroke onset. Hippocampal volume was measured from T1 weighted images, hippocampal mean diffusivity was calculated from diffusion tensor imaging and connectivity was calculated from resting state fMRI. Global cognitive assessments were evaluated during hospitalization and 6 and 12 months later using a computerized neuropsychological battery. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test which of the hippocampi measurements best predict cognitive state. All three imaging parameters were significantly correlated to each other (|r's| >0.3, P's?<?0.005), and with cognitive state 6 and 12 months after the event. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated the predictive role of hippocampal mean diffusivity (??=??0.382, P?=?0.026) on cognitive state, above and beyond that of volume and connectivity of this structure. To our knowledge, the combination of hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity and connectivity in first ever post stroke or TIA patients has not yet been considered in relation to cognitive state. The results demonstrate the predictive role of hippocampal mean diffusivity, suggesting that these changes may precede and contribute to volumetric and connectivity changes in the hippocampi, potentially serving as a marker for early identification of patients at risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) are both involved in the restructuring of connective tissues. Evidence also implicates MMP9 and sICAM in cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases, where blood levels may be a marker of disease severity or prognosis. In individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), higher risk for cardiovascular illness has been extensively reported. Methods The aim of this investigation was to measure and compare peripheral levels of serum MMP9 and sICAM in adults with euthymic BD and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we focussed on correlations with illness severity and metabolic parameters. Results MMP9 levels among the BD sample (n = 112) were significantly higher than among the HC (n = 80) (MMP9: F = 9.885, p = 0.002, ?2 = 0.058) after controlling for confounding factors. Patients with BD in a later, progressive stage of disease showed significantly higher MMP9 as well as sICAM-1 levels compared to patients with BD in an earlier stage of disease (MMP9: F = 5.8, p = 0.018, ?2 = 0.054; sICAM-1: F = 5.6, p = 0.020, ?2 = 0.052). Correlation analyses of cognitive measures revealed a negative association between performance on the d2 Test of Attention and MMP9 (r = ?0.287, p = 0.018) in the BD sample. Despite the sample being euthymic (i.e., according to conventional criteria) at the time of analysis, we found significant correlations between MMP9 as well as sICAM-1 and subthreshold depressive/hypomanic symptoms. Conclusions A collection of disparate findings herein point to a role of MMP9 and cICAM-1 in the patho-progressive process of BD: the increased levels of serum MMP9 and sICAM-1, the correlation between higher levels of these parameters, progressive stage, and cognitive dysfunction in BD, and the positive correlation with subthreshold symptoms. As sICAM-1 and MMP9 are reliable biomarkers of inflammatory and early atherosclerotic disease, these markers may provide indications of the presence of occult cardiovascular disease in this highly at-risk population.

AB  - Summary Preclinical evidence supports targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To support ongoing clinical development of an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody, we have investigated for the first time the mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of a blocking anti-murine C5aR (anti-mC5aR) surrogate antibody in mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). First, efficacy was demonstrated in a multiple-dose treatment study. Almost complete inhibition of clinical disease progression was obtained, including reduced bone and cartilage destruction in anti-mC5aR-treated mice. Then, the mechanism of action was examined by looking for early effects of anti-mC5aR treatment in single-dose treatment studies. We found that 48?h after single-dose treatment with anti-mC5aR, the neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the paws was already reduced. In addition, several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A were reduced locally in the paws, indicating reduction of local inflammation. Furthermore, dose-setting experiments supported a beneficial clinical effect of dosing above the C5aR saturation level. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrated rapid onset effects of antibody blockade of C5aR. The data have translational value in supporting the Novo Nordisk clinical trials of an anti-C5aR antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients, by identifying potential biomarkers of treatment effects as well as by providing information on pharmacodynamics and novel insights into the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody blockade of C5aR.

AB  - Objective? To compare the effects of postoperative pain after ovariohysterectomy by harmonic scalpel-assisted laparoscopy (HALO) and traditional ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in dogs. Study Design? A randomized, blinded, prospective study. Sample Population? Sixteen, purpose-bred, intact female, Beagle dogs. Methods? Dogs were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (8 dogs), which had OVH by HALO, and Group 2 (8 dogs), which had traditional OVH. Physiologic data, abdominal nociceptive threshold scores, and University of Melbourne pain scores (UMPS) were recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, glucose, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were collected at the time of the incision, and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Results? No significant surgical complications occurred. The HALO mean surgical time was significantly longer (55.7 minutes) than traditional OVH (31.7 minutes). No significant differences were observed between groups for the pain measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, CPK, and glucose concentrations. The OVH group had significantly higher mean plasma cortisol levels at hour 2 after surgery than the HALO group (P=.0001). The mean UMPS were significantly higher in OVH than the HALO group at all postoperative times (P=.0001). The mean nociceptive threshold measurements revealed significantly higher tolerated palpation pressures in HALO than OVH at all postoperative times, except hour 72 (P=.0002). Conclusions? Dogs appeared to be in less pain with HALO than OVH. The harmonic scalpel coagulated ovarian and uterine vessels completely with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Clinical Relevance? HALO is a safe alternative to OVH and offers a minimally invasive and less painful method of surgery.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the postoperative analgesic effects of intravenous (IV) lidocaine, meloxicam, and their combination in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Animals Twenty-seven dogs aged (mean ± SD) 16.1 ± 7.5 months and weighing 22.4 ± 17.9 kg scheduled for ovariohysterectomy. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Dogs (n = 9 in each group) were allocated to receive just prior to and during surgery one of the following regimens: M group, 0.2 mg kg?1 IV meloxicam then a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of lactated Ringer's at 10 mL kg?1 hour?1; L group, a bolus of lidocaine (1 mg kg?1 IV) then a CRI of lidocaine at 0.025 mg kg?1 minute?1; and M + L group, both the above meloxicam and lidocaine treatments. Pain and sedation were scored, and venous samples taken for serum cortisol and glucose measurement before and at intervals for 12 hours after anaesthesia. Pain scores were assessed using a multi-parameter subjective scoring scale (cumulative scale 0?21) by three observers. The protocol stated that dogs with a total score exceeding 9 or a sub-score above 3 in any one category would receive rescue analgesia. Sedation was scored on a scale of 0?4. Results There were no significant differences in subjective pain scores, serum cortisol, and glucose concentrations between the three groups. The highest pain score at any time was 5, and no dog required rescue analgesia. None of the three regimens caused any observable side effects during or after anaesthesia. At 1 and 2 hours after extubation dogs in group L were significantly more sedated than in the other two groups. Conclusions and Clinical relevance This study suggests that, with the scoring system used, IV lidocaine and meloxicam provide similar and adequate post-operative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - Abstract Aim To use systematic methods to examine how resilience is defined in empirical research. Background Resilience is a term that is increasingly being used to describe and explain the complexities of individual and group responses to traumatic and challenging situations. It is now frequently mentioned in relation to many areas of nursing practice, including research. Given the increasing use of the term, it is timely to examine how resilience has been defined in empirical research. Design An integrative review of the empirical literature (2000?2015). Data sources Three health-related databases were searched: Medline, PsycINFO and the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL). Reference and citation tracking was performed on all articles included in the review. Review methods The methods described by Whittemore and Knafl were used to guide this review. Two reviewers were involved in screening articles for inclusion and in the data extraction process. Data were synthesized using the constant comparative method of analysis. Results One hundred articles were included in the final data analysis. The most significant finding of the review was that there is no universal definition of resilience. There were, however, some common themes identified: rising above, adaptation and adjustment, dynamic process, ?ordinary magic? and mental illness as a marker of resilience. Conclusion Despite the increasing use of the term ?resilience?, this review has identified that there is no universal definition of resilience adopted in the research literature. Further research is required to explore this construct in the context of nursing.

SettingA community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. ParticipantsForty of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. Main outcome measuresResults on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of Northern Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. ResultsMore than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P< 0.001) and serious (P< 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P<0.001). Twenty or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; ConclusionsAlthough a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored.

AB  - Summary Marbofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic expected to be effective in the treatment of infections involving Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria in horses. In order to design a rational dosage regimen for the substance in horses, the pharmacokinetic properties of marbofloxacin were investigated in 6 horses after i.v., subcutaneous and oral administration of a single dose of 2 mg/kg bwt and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) assessed forbacteria isolated from equine infectious pathologies. The clearance of marbofloxacin was mean ± s.d. 0.25 ± 0.05 l/kg/h and the terminal half-life 7.56 ± 1.99 h. The marbofloxacin absolute bioavailabilities after subcutaneous and oral administration were 98 ± 11% and 62 ± 8%, respectively. The MIC required to inhibit 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.027 ?g/ml for enterobacteriaceae and 0.21 ?g/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. The values of surrogate markers of antimicrobial efficacy (AUIC, Cmax/MIC ratio, time above MIC90) were calculated and the marbofloxacin concentration profiles simulated for repeated administrations. These data were used to determine rational dosage regimens for target bacteria. Considering the breakpoint values of efficacy indices for fluoroquinolones, a marbofloxacin dosage regimen of 2 mg/kg bwt/24 h by i.v., subcutaneous or oral routes was more appropriate for enterobacteriaceae than for S. aureus.

AB  - Objective To characterize bone height and buccal cortical bone thickness of the caudal mandible of healthy dogs. Study Design Prospective original study. Sample Population Client-owned dogs (n?=?36). Methods Dogs were distributed by weight into 3 groups (<10, 10?20, >20?kg). Thirteen transverse plane computed tomography images were selected for each dog based on anatomic landmarks from the 4th premolar (PM4) through the 2nd molar. On each image, bone thickness was measured along the buccal surface of both mandibles from the alveolar margin to the ventral border in 3?mm increments. The number of 3?mm increments were recorded as an estimation of mandibular height. Results Buccal bone was generally thicker ventrally in the area studied with decreasing bone thickness over both roots of PM4 and the mesial root of the 1st molar (M1). Cortical bone thickness of <2.0?mm was measured across all groups at most locations 3?mm ventral from the alveolar margin. Mandibular bone height demonstrated significantly fewer (P?<?.05) 3?mm increments over the distal root of M1 in dogs >10?kg compared with the number of observations at the immediately mesial and distal locations. Conclusion Thin cortical bone overlying the mesial and distal roots of PM4 and the mesial root of M1 limits use of these areas for application of monocortical anchorage devices. Decreased mandibular bone height at mandibular M1 may create a stress riser at this location, which along with thin cortical bone may explain why this is a common area for mandibular fracture.

AB  - Summary Objective: To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of amikacin in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to analyse whether these patients show different kinetic behaviour on the basis of their clinical diagnoses. Method: The patient population comprised 104 medical ICU patients on amikacin treatment for several presumed or documented Gram-negative infections. Four study groups were defined according to patients' clinical diagnosis: sepsis group (n= 39), trauma group (n= 20), pneumonia group (n= 21) and ?other diagnosis? group (n= 24). The pharmacokinetic parameters for amikacin in these patients were then compared. Results: The ICU patients were found to have increased values for the amikacin volume of distribution (0.52 ± 0.21 litres/kg), whereas total amikacin clearance expressed as a linear function of creatinine clearance was Cl (ml/min/kg)= 0.13 ± 0.86 ClCR which is not significantly different from other estimations reported in the literature. However, this relationship revealed statistically significant differences among the four groups of ICU patients. Moreover, the septic and trauma patients showed higher (but not statistically significant) values for the amikacin volume of distribution. Conclusion: The amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters obtained should allow Bayesian individualization of amikacin doses in patients admitted to medical ICUs, on the basis of their clinical diagnoses.

AB  - This paper highlights the many complex psychological needs of paediatric patients in intensive care. The literature on the experience of children in intensive care and their relatives is reviewed and related to the work of a paediatric psychologist. Case examples are given of direct work with children and suggestions are made of ways in which the psychologist can work in a consultation/liaison capacity. The personal impact of this work is addressed, as is the need to disseminate information to other health professionals. Further research is called for, both on the child's experience and on the development of appropriate psychological interventions.

AB  - The amount of myelin in the outer band of Baillarger in the human visual cortex stained by Luxol Fast Blue MBS, has been measured in normal individuals of wide age range, in a group of blind and severely visually impaired but otherwise normal individuals and in a series of demented patients of the Alzheimer and multi-infarct type who were apparently visually normal. The amount of myelin is found to be significantly reduced in the blind and demented groups. Examination of the lateral geniculate body in the blind cases demonstrated slight reduction in neuron numbers and marked reduction in mean neuron diameter. Neuronal cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid, nucleolar volume and numbers of tetraploid glial nuclei in the blind or visually impaired cases were significantly reduced when compared with controls, indicating reduced function in these neurons. Similar results were obtained on examining this nucleus in Alzheimer and multi-infarct cases, suggesting that the visual pathways may be involved in these conditions. It is concluded that loss of myelin from the outer band of Baillarger occurs in association with reduced function of neurons in the lateral geniculate body.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although the short-term impact of incident fragility fractures on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of older people has been confirmed, we lack long-term evidence. We explored the impact of incident fragility fractures on HRQL, among people aged 50 years and older, using 10-year prospective data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). This study was based on data from 7753 (2187 men and 5566 women) participants of CaMos. The HRQL, measured through the Health Utility Index (HUI), was captured at baseline and year 10. The incident fragility fractures were recorded over 10 years of follow-up at spine, hip, rib, shoulder, pelvis, or forearm. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to measure the mean difference, termed as deficit, in the HUI scores for participants with and without fractures. We examined the effects of single or multiple fragility fractures, time (fractures that occurred between year 1 to 5 and 6 to 10) and recovery to the prefracture level. Incident spine and hip fractures were associated with significant deficits (varied from ?0.19 to ?0.07) on the HUI scores. Hip and spine fractures were associated with negative impact on mobility, self-care, and ambulation. Fractures that occurred closer to the follow-up assessment were associated with significant impact on HRQL compared to fractures occurring a long time before it, except for hip fracture (deficits lasted 5 years or longer). Similarly, multiple hip (?0.14), spine (?0.16), and rib (?0.21) fractures significantly impacted the HRQL of women. Women with a hip fracture never recovered to their prefracture level score (OR?=?0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). Our analysis suggests that single and multiple hip fractures as well as multiple spine and rib fractures strongly impact the HRQL of older people over a prolonged period of time. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
