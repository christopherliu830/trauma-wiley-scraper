AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine whether nulliparae whose second stage of labour is conducted in an obstetric birth chair have a lower incidence of instrumental delivery than those using a conventional delivery bed. Design? Randomized controlled trial using sealed, opaque envelopes for allocation. Setting? Delivery ward in a busy teaching hospital. Patients? 1250 nulliparae with a singleton live fetus with cephalic presentation, without epidural anaesthesia, who had achieved full dilatation. Intervention? Intention to conduct second and third stages of labour in either the Birth-EZ chair or the conventional delivery bed, as randomly allocated. Main outcome measures? Primary measure: vaginal operative delivery; principal secondary measures: duration of second stage, perineal trauma, blood loss, women's views, and neonatal status. Results? Delivery in the birth chair did not result in a reduction in operative delivery, overall. However, there was a reduction in vaginal operative delivery for fetal heart rate abnormality. There was no beneficial effect on perineal trauma or puerperal perineal pain. Post-partum haemorrhage was more frequent in the birth chair group. Conclusions? Delivery in the birth chair does not offer any obvious advantage to women over delivery on a bed.

AB  - Summary Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has relevant consequences on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers, and is one of the principal causes of hospitalization in cirrhosis. Also, HE is a marker of poor prognosis. Its diagnosis requires an accurate and work-up to consider confounders, factors of vulnerability, and precipitation. The detection and monitoring of the covert expression of HE, which require psychometric or neurophysiologic investigation having their own specific characteristics and value, is considered in detail. Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this condition, treatment options are highlighted in their meaning, so that clinical practice is greatly helped by this comprehensive update.

AB  - Abstract Transplantation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NS/PCs) is a promising treatment for a variety of neuropathological conditions. Although previous reports have indicated the effectiveness of hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation into the injured spinal cord of rodents and nonhuman primates, long-term observation of hiPSC-NS/PCs post-transplantation suggested some ?unsafe? differentiation-resistant properties, resulting in disordered overgrowth. These findings suggest that, even if ?safe? NS/PCs are transplanted into the human central nervous system (CNS), the dynamics of cellular differentiation of stem cells should be noninvasively tracked to ensure safety. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides molecular-functional information and helps to detect specific disease conditions. The current study was conducted to visualize Nestin (an NS/PC marker)-positive undifferentiated neural cells in the CNS of immune-deficient (nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune-deficient) mice after hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation with PET, using 18?kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligands as labels. TSPO was recently found to be expressed in rodent NS/PCs, and its expression decreased with the progression of neuronal differentiation. We hypothesized that TSPO would also be present in hiPSC-NS/PCs and expressed strongly in residual immature neural cells after transplantation. The results showed high levels of TSPO expression in immature hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells, and decreased TSPO expression as neural differentiation progressed in vitro. Furthermore, PET with [18F] FEDAC (a TSPO radioligand) was able to visualize the remnant undifferentiated hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells consisting of TSPO and Nestin+ cells in vivo. These findings suggest that PET with [18F] FEDAC could play a key role in the safe clinical application of CNS repair in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Host stem/progenitor cells can be mobilized and recruited to a target location using biomaterials, and these cells may be used for in situ tissue regeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate whether host biologic resources could be used to regenerate renal tissue in situ. Collagen hydrogel was injected into the kidneys of normal mice, and rat kidneys that had sustained ischemia/reperfusion injury. After injection, the kidneys of both animal models were examined up to 4 weeks for host tissue response. The infiltrating host cells present within the injection regions expressed renal stem/progenitor cell markers, PAX-2, CD24, and CD133, as well as mesenchymal stem cell marker, CD44. The regenerated renal structures were identified by immunohistochemistry for renal cell specific markers, including synaptopodin and CD31 for glomeruli and cytokeratin and neprilysin for tubules. Quantitatively, the number of glomeruli found in the injected regions was significantly higher when compared to normal regions of renal cortex. This phenomenon occurred in normal and ischemic injured kidneys. Furthermore, the renal function after ischemia/reperfusion injury was recovered after collagen hydrogel injection. These results demonstrate that introduction of biomaterials into the kidney is able to facilitate the regeneration of glomerular and tubular structures in normal and injured kidneys. Such an approach has the potential to become a simple and effective treatment for patients with renal failure. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:241?250

AB  - ABSTRACT Myofibroblasts (MFs), a contractile subset of fibroblasts, play a pivotal role in physiological wound healing and in the development of many fibroconnective disorders. The complex cytokine network regulating the function of MFs in joint stiffness is still poorly understood. In this in vitro study, we investigated the effect of the cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN-?) on MFs isolated from human joint capsules. MFs were cultivated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-? alone or in combination with IFN-? neutralizing antibodies. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and mRNA gene expression of the MF markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I were analyzed in MF cultures. Contraction potential was analyzed in an established collagen gel contraction assay simulating the extracellular matrix. Using immunofluorescence staining, we could verify that MFs express IFN-?-receptor (R)-1 on their membrane. IFN-? decreased MF viability and significantly elevated the apoptosis rate in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-? down-regulated α-SMA and collagen type I mRNA expression which was associated with a diminished MF mediated contraction of the gel matrices. These effects were suppressed by simultaneous treatment of cells with a neutralizing IFN-? antibody. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the cytokine IFN-? is a crucial component of the regulatory network of capsule MFs. IFN-? notably influences the ability of MFs to contract collagen matrices by suppressing α-SMA gene expression. IFN-? is toxic for MFs in high concentrations and may negatively regulate the number of pro-fibrotic MFs during the healing process via induction of cell apoptosis. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Over the course of the lifespan, humans encounter and must adapt to various psychosocial and physiological challenges. During childhood, we experience critical periods during which we are particularly sensitive to stimuli in our environment and received care from primary caretakers. Experiences of persistent stress or trauma during childhood can have deleterious effects on mental health and physical growth and development. Children who experience particularly challenging stressors including poverty, abuse, neglect, or exposure to violence face higher risk of delayed or diminished growth, obesity, mental health challenges including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), and chronic disease in adulthood. Current research investigates ways to mediate this risk via social support for primary caregivers and improvements in social conditions that may have transgenerational effects.

AB  - Summary Gait analysis is gaining popularity for quantification of lameness and 2 commonly used inertial sensor systems assess trunk movement symmetry: can these be used interchangeably in multi-centre studies? We compared head and pelvic movement symmetry between 2 inertial sensor gait analysis systems in 13 horses equipped simultaneously with the 2 systems. The first system quantified dorsoventral movement in the local reference frame (System A) and the second system global vertical movement (System B). Widths of limits of agreement were calculated employing a well established regression method dealing with systematically changing differences over the range of measured values. Widths of limits of agreement between Systems A and B were narrower for pelvic movement than head movement. For head movement, they ranged from 6.4 to 6.9 mm for in-hand trot and from 7.3 to 9.7 mm on the lunge and for pelvic movement from 2.5 to 4.4 mm in-hand and from 3.6 to 5.3 mm on the lunge. Widths of limits of agreement between the 2 investigated inertial sensor gait analysis systems are of comparable magnitude (some equivalent, some marginally higher) to the currently proposed thresholds of 6 mm for head and 3 mm for pelvic movement used in lameness investigations. Differences in measurements with 2 different systems (A and B) obtained from the same horse falling within the reported values should not be seen as a sign of a change in lameness.

AB  - Abstract Background/Objectives Higher resting heart rate is a risk factor for arterial cardiovascular diseases. We assessed whether higher heart rate is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods In a prospective epidemiologic cohort, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we associated resting heart rate by electrocardiogram with physician-validated incident hospitalized VTE through 2015. We also examined whether lower heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic imbalance, might be a risk factor for VTE. Results Resting heart rate at Visit 1 (1987-1989), when participants were 45 to 64 years old (mean, 54 years), was not associated with incidence of VTE (n = 882 cases). However, heart rate at Visit 4 (1996-1998; mean age, 63 years) was associated positively with VTE (n = 557 cases). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of VTE across Visit 4 heart rate categories of <60, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 bpm were 1 (reference), 1.22 (1.01-1.49), 1.39 (1.09-1.78), and 1.44 (1.01-2.06), respectively, and when evaluated continuously 1.11 (1.02-1.21) per 10 bpm greater heart rate. For the most part, HRV indices were not associated with VTE or associations were explained by inverse correlations of HRV indices with heart rate. Conclusion We found a significant positive and independent association of resting heart rate at ARIC Visit 4 with incidence of VTE. The reason why high heart rate is a risk marker for VTE warrants further exploration.

AB  - Abstract The ability to identify oligodendrocytes in culture, in fixed tissue, and in vivo using unique markers is a requisite step to understanding their responses in any damage, recovery, or developmental process. Their nuclei are readily seen in histological preparations of healthy white and gray matter, and their cell bodies can be reliably identified with a variety of immunocytochemical markers. However, there is little consensus regarding optimal methods to assess oligodendrocyte survival or morphology under experimental injury conditions. We review common approaches for histological and immunocytochemical identification of these cells. Transgenic and viral methods for cell type-selective transfer of genes encoding fluorescent proteins offer promising new approaches for manipulating and visualizing oligodendrocytes in models of health and disease. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Bone marrow derived stromal cells are of mesenchymal origin and precursor cells for skeletal tissue components such as chondroblasts and osteoblasts. Furthermore, under experimental conditions, a differentiation potency into myogenic and neuronal cells could be demonstrated. Because of their multipotency these cells represent a population of non-haematogen stem cells that can be regarded as an alternative to human embryonic stem cells for future autologous cell replacement therapies. For a closer look at the differentiation capacity of these cells, rat and human bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from the femur bone and kept in the cell culture applying different cultivation protocols. In a cultivation medium with a serum content of 20%, the majority of these cells express a variety of neuronal markers such as ß-III Tubulin and NeuN as well as the astrocyte marker GFAP, while a minority of about 20% express the marker for neural precursor cells nestin. Cultivation in a chemically defined serum free medium results in the differentiation of a markedly higher percentage of nestin positive neural precursor-like cells. Using bFGF in combination with B27 these cells can be forced to form three dimensionally organized spheres. In order to elucidate a possible therapeutical potency of the bone marrow derived cells the synthesis of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and NGF were analysed using the ELISA technique. Furthermore, they can be infected using a third generation adenoviral vector with high efficiency and show migratory activity in vitro. After injection of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into the lateral ventricle of adult rats they adhere to the ependymocytes and pass the ependymal barrier in order to settle in the subventricular space.
