AB  - Objective To compare pelvic limb joint kinematics and temporal gait characteristics during land-based and aquatic-based treadmill walking in dogs that have undergone surgical stabilisation for cranial cruciate ligament deficiency. Materials and Methods Client-owned dogs with surgically stabilised stifles following cranial cruciate ligament deficiency performed three walking trials consisting of three consecutive gait cycles on an aquatic treadmill under four water levels. Hip, stifle and hock range of motion; peak extension; and peak flexion were assessed for the affected limb at each water level. Gait cycle time and stance phase percentage were also determined. Results Ten client-owned dogs of varying breeds were evaluated at a mean of 55·2?days postoperatively. Aquatic treadmill water level influenced pelvic limb kinematics and temporal gait outcomes. Increased stifle joint flexion was observed as treadmill water level increased, peaking when the water level was at the hip. Similarly, hip flexion increased at the hip water level. Stifle range of motion was greatest at stifle and hip water levels. Stance phase percentage was significantly decreased when water level was at the hip. Clinical Significance Aquatic treadmill walking has become a common rehabilitation modality following surgical stabilisation of cranial cruciate ligament deficiency. However, evidence-based best practice guidelines to enhance stifle kinematics do not exist. Our findings suggest that rehabilitation utilising a water level at or above the stifle will achieve the best stifle kinematics following surgical stifle stabilisation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Conventional wound therapy utilizes wound coverage to prevent infection, trauma, and fluid and thermal loss. However, this approach is often inadequate for large and/or chronic wounds, which require active intervention via therapeutic cells to promote healing. To address this need, a patch which delivers multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) is developed. Medical-grade polyurethane (PU) films are modified using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), which creates a radical-rich layer capable of rapidly and covalently attaching biomolecules. It is demonstrated that a short treatment duration of 400 s maximizes surface activation and wettability, minimizes reduction in gas permeability, and preserves the hydrolytic resistance of the PU film. The reactivity of PIII-treated PU is utilized to immobilize the extracellular matrix protein tropoelastin in a functional conformation that stably withstands medical-grade ethylene oxide sterilization. The PIII-treated tropoelastin-functionalized patch significantly promotes MAPC adhesion and proliferation over standard PU, while fully maintaining cell phenotype. Topical application of the MAPC-seeded patch transfers cells to a human skin model, while undelivered MAPCs repopulate the patch surface for subsequent cell transfer. The potential of this new wound patch as a reservoir for the sustained delivery of therapeutic MAPCs and cell-secreted factors for large and/or non-healing wounds is indicated in the findings.

AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary Critical illness, an extreme form of severe physical stress, is characterized by important endocrine and metabolic changes. Due to critical care medicine, survival from previously lethal conditions has become possible but many patients now enter a chronic phase of critical illness. The role of the endocrine and metabolic responses to acute and prolonged critical illness in mediating or hampering recovery remains highly debated. In recent years, important novel insights into the pathophysiology and the consequences of these endocrine responses to acute and chronic critical illness have been generated. This chapter summarizes these insights with a specific focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and on the impact of the hyperglycemic response, on recovery from critical illness. The therapeutic implications of these novel insights are critically analyzed.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Abstract The objective of our study was to determine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activity in the brain following GM-CSF induction. We injected recombinant mouse GM-CSF into the brains of 8-month-old C57BL6 mice via intracerebroventricular injections and studied the activities of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. We also sought to determine whether an anti-GM-CSF antibody could suppress endogenous microglial activity in the C57BL6 mice and could also suppress microglial activity induced by the recombinant mouse GM-CSF in another group of C57BL6 mice. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we assessed microglial, astrocytic, and neuronal activity by measuring mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, GFAP, and the neuronal marker NeuN in the cerebral cortex tissues from C57BL6 mice. We performed immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of activated microglia in different regions of the brains from control (phosphate-buffered saline-injected C57BL6 mice) and experimental mice (recombinant GM-CSF-injected C57BL6 mice, GM-CSF antibody-injected C57BL6 mice, and recombinant mouse GM-CSF plus anti-GM-CSF antibody-injected C57BL6 mice). We found increased mRNA expression of CD40 (9.75-fold), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (2.1-fold), CD45 (1.73-fold), and CD11c (1.70-fold) in the cerebral cortex of C57BL6 mice that were induced with recombinant GM-CSF, compared with control mice. Further, the anti-GM-CSF antibody suppressed microglia in mice that were induced with recombinant GM-CSF. Our immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry findings of GM-CSF-associated cytokines in C57BL6 mice induced with recombinant GM-CSF, in C57BL6 mice injected with the anti-GM-CSF antibody, and in C57BL6 mice injected with recombinant mouse GM-CSF plus anti-GM-CSF antibody concurred with our real-time RT-PCR findings. These findings suggest that GM-CSF is critical for microglial activation and that anti-GM-CSF antibody suppresses microglial activity in the CNS. The findings from this study may have implications for anti-inflammatory effects of Alzheimer?s disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice (a multiple sclerosis mouse model).

AB  - The synthesis of factors that monitor the expression of the Thy-l cell surface component by marker-negative precursor cells requires an intact left cerebral cortex, whereas the activity of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, an immunopotentiator that increases this synthesis, seems to require an intact right neocortex. These results suggest a role for the cerebral cortex in the coordinated interregulation of lymphocyte subclasses. The finding extends previous information suggesting relationships between the central nervous system and the T-cell arm of the immune system.

AB  - ABSTRACT Blood platelets prevent bleeding after trauma by forming occlusive aggregates at sites of vascular injury. Platelet aggregation is mediated by the integrin heterodimer αIIb?3 and occurs when platelet agonists generated at the injury site convert αIIb?3 from its resting to its active conformation. Active αIIb?3 is then able to bind macromolecular ligands such as fibrinogen that crosslink adjacent platelets into hemostatic aggregates. Platelets circulate in a plasma milieu containing high concentrations of the principal αIIb?3 ligand fibrinogen. Thus, αIIb?3 activity is tightly regulated to prevent the spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates. αIIb?3 activity is regulated at least three levels. First, intramolecular interactions involving motifs located in the membrane-proximal stalk regions, transmembrane domains, and the membrane-proximal cytosolic tails of αIIb and ?3 maintain αIIb?3 in its inactive conformation. Transmembrane domain interactions appear particularly important because disrupting these interactions causes constitutive αIIb?3 activation. Second, the agonist-stimulated binding of the cytosolic proteins talin and kindlin-3 to the ?3 cytosolic tail rapidly causes αIIb?3 activation by disrupting the intramolecular interactions constraining αIIb?3 activity. Third, the strength of ligand binding to active αIIb?3 seems to be allosterically regulated. Thus, αIIb?3 exists in a minimum of three interconvertible states: an inactive (resting) state that does not interact with ligands and two active ligand binding states that differ in their affinity for fibrinogen and in the mechanical stability of fibrinogen complexes they form. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Sutures play an important role in wound repair by supporting healing tissues. Understanding the various characteristics of suture materials enables appropriate selection. However, no single suture material is ideal, and compromises must be made. Proper suture placement, using specific patterns, generally ensures a predictable progression of wound healing and of scar formation. Drains, when properly applied, may help to prevent or at least lessen complications during healing. Sutures and drains are not substitutes for proper wound management because they cannot compensate for poor cleansing, debridement, and wound irrigation. Moreover, inappropriate use of sutures and drains may delay healing and may lead to scarring.

Results The day after surgery, the remaining mandibular symphysis (<5?mm) fractured causing marked instability of the hemi-mandibles. Partial wound dehiscence occurred 5 days after surgery; however, the mare was able to eat well and the incision healed within 2 weeks. At 18 months, there was bony fusion of the hemi-mandibles and mild protrusion of the tongue. Conclusion Extensive rostral mandibulectomy (up to the caudal edge of the mandibular symphysis) can apparently be performed in a horse without internal or external stabilization, and yield a cosmetic and functional outcome.
