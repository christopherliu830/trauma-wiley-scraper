AB  - Radio-activated gene therapy has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer; however, expression of therapeutic gene in peritumoral tissues will result in unacceptable toxicity to normal cells. To restrict gene expression in targeted tumor mass, we used hypoxia and radiation tolerance features of tumor cells to develop a synthetic AND gate genetic circuit through connecting radiation sensitivity promoter cArG6, heat shock response elements SNF1, HSF1 and HSE4 with retroviral vector plxsn. Their construction and dynamic activity process were identified through downstream enhanced green fluorescent protein and wtp53 expression in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and in a nude mice model. The result showed that AND gate genetic circuit could be activated by lower required radiation dose (6 Gy) and after activated, AND gate could induce significant apoptosis effects and growth inhibition of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The radiation- and hypoxia-activated AND gate genetic circuit, which could lead to more powerful target tumoricidal activity represented a promising strategy for both targeted and effective gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma and low dose activation character of the AND gate genetic circuit implied that this model could be further exploited to decrease side-effects of clinical radiation therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during ?off-line? states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, ?p-ripples,? which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. ? 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The European Study Group on Diabetes and the Lower Extremity is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary network of 14 centres from ten countries. In 2003?2004, all patients treated in the participating centres because of a new diabetic foot ulcer (n?=?1232) were included in a prospective observational study. Subjects attended follow-up visits on a monthly basis until final outcome: healing of the foot, lower-leg amputation, death or non-healing after 1?year. During all visits, data were recorded on standardized case record forms by investigators who were trained during several plenary meetings and on-site visits. Unique aspects of the study were its size, the pan-European scope and the integrated/holistic approach for a multi-organ disease. In this review, the main findings of the study and its implications for diabetic foot care are discussed. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study tested the hypothesis that side-to-side differences in knee gait mechanics 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are associated with long-term (?8 years post-reconstruction) changes in patient-reported outcome scores. Sixteen subjects (5 males; age: 29.1?±?7.1 years) with primary unilateral ACL reconstruction were gait tested at baseline (2.2?±?0.3 years post-ACL reconstruction) and filled out KOOS and Lysholm surveys. At long-term follow-up (7.7?±?0.7 years post-ACL reconstruction), the same subjects completed KOOS and Lysholm surveys. Pearson correlation coefficients assessed relationships between side-to-side differences in kinematics and kinetics at baseline and changes in Lysholm and KOOS Pain/QOL scores from 2 to 8 years post-ACL reconstruction. Significant associations were seen between greater average varus rotation (Lysholm: R?=??0.654, p?=?0.006) and less anterior femoral displacement (Lysholm: R?=?0.578, p?=?0.019) during stance of the ACL reconstructed knee versus the contralateral knee at baseline and worse follow-up outcome scores. Significant associations were seen between greater peak knee flexion moment (KOOS Pain: R?=??0.572, p?=?0.026; KOOS QOL: R?=??0.636, p?=?0.011), peak knee adduction moment (Lysholm: R?=??0.582, p?=?0.018; KOOS Pain: R?=??0.742, p?=?0.002; KOOS QOL: R?=??0.551, p?=?0.033), and peak internal rotation moment (Lysholm: R?=?0.525, p?=?0.037; KOOS Pain: R?=?0.815, p?<?0.001; KOOS QOL: R?=?0.777, p?=?0.001) in the ACL reconstructed knee at baseline with worse follow-up outcomes. The results of this study support the hypotheses that early changes in gait mechanics following ACL reconstruction are associated with longer-term clinical changes in patient-reported outcomes, suggesting that biomechanical markers obtained as early as 2 years after ACL reconstruction may be useful to understand clinical outcomes in this population. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

AB  - Summary Background Irisin is a new adipo-myokine, encoded by the FNDC5 gene. Currently, there is a discussion regarding the relation between thyroid function and irisin concentration. This prospective study assesses the influence of thyrometabolic changes on serum irisin concentration in association with altered muscle metabolism. This is performed on a large cohort of patients affected by severe hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as well as by the expression of the FNDC5 gene in thyroid tissue affected by different pathologies. Methods The study group comprised 119 patients with newly diagnosed severe hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and a control group of 45 healthy subjects. Body composition, serum irisin concentrations, and thyroid-related hormones, creatine kinase, dystrophin and titin concentrations were evaluated. FNDC5 expression was also analysed in tissue samples from 80 patients with nontoxic multinodular goitre, toxic goitre, Graves? disease and papillary thyroid cancer. Results Irisin concentration was lower in patients with prolonged hypothyroidism. There was a tendency towards lower dystrophin and titin concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Restoration of euthyroidism in patients with hypothyroidism resulted in a decreased muscle mass with an increase in irisin concentrations, while the hyperthyroid group showed an increase in fat mass. Statistically significant overexpression of FNDC5 gene was found in patients with toxic goitre as compared to Graves? disease, papillary thyroid cancer and controls. Conclusions The presented data support the theory that irisin concentration changes are associated with prolonged hypothyroidism and might primarily constitute the result of prolonged myopathy. These changes are most likely not related to the expression of the FNDC5 gene in the thyroid gland.

AB  - Abstract In this review we critically summarize the evidence base and the progress to date regarding the genomic basis of periodontal disease and tooth morbidity (ie, dental caries and tooth loss), and discuss future applications and research directions in the context of precision oral health and care. Evidence for these oral/dental traits from genome-wide association studies first emerged less than a decade ago. Basic and translational research activities in this domain are now under way by multiple groups around the world. Key departure points in the oral health genomics discourse are: (a) some heritable variation exists for periodontal and dental diseases; (b) the environmental component (eg, social determinants of health and behavioral risk factors) has a major influence on the population distribution but probably interacts with factors of innate susceptibility at the person-level; (c) sizeable, multi-ethnic, well-characterized samples or cohorts with high-quality measures on oral health outcomes and genomics information are required to make decisive discoveries; (d) challenges remain in the measurement of oral health and disease, with current periodontitis and dental caries traits capturing only a part of the health-disease continuum, and are little or not informed by the underlying biology; (e) the substantial individual heterogeneity that exists in the clinical presentation and lifetime trajectory of oral disease can be identified and leveraged in a precision medicine framework or, if unappreciated, can hamper translational efforts. In this review we discuss how composite or biologically informed traits may offer improvements over clinically defined ones for the genomic interrogation of oral diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the results of genome-wide association studies for the development and testing of a genetic risk score for severe periodontitis. We conclude that exciting opportunities lie ahead for improvements in the oral health of individual patients and populations via advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of oral health and disease. The pace of new discoveries and their equitable translation to practice will largely depend on investments in the education and training of the oral health care workforce, basic and population research, and sustained collaborative efforts..

AB  - Abstract The effect of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of neural lesions is so far not satisfactory. Magnetic stimulation is a feasible exogenous interference to improve transplantation outcome. However, the effect of magnetic stimulation on the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into neuron has not been studied. In this experiment, an in vitro neuron differentiation system from human iPSCs were established and confirmed. Three magnetic stimuli (high frequency [HF], low frequency [LF], intermittent theta-burst stimulation [iTBS]) were applied twice a day during the differentiation process. Immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) were performed to analyze the effect of magnetic stimulation. Neural stem cells were obtained on day 12, manifested as floating neurospheres expressing neural precursor markers. All groups can differentiate into neurons while glial cell markers were not detected. Both Immunofluorescence and PCR results showed LF and iTBS increased the transcription and expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN). HF significantly increased vesicular glutamate transporters2 transcription while iTBS promoted transcription of both synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. These results indicate that LF and iTBS can promote the generation of mature neurons from human iPSCs; HF may promote differentiate into glutamatergic neurons while iTBS may promote synapse formation during the differentiation.

AB  - Abstract We develop a new combination strategy to predict retention times of oligonucleotides in ion-pair reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The key step of the strategy is to use score of generalized base properties (SGBP) combined with auto cross covariance (ACC) to resolve the feature representation of nucleic acids. This representation characterize physicochemical, quantumchemical, topological, spatial structural features, etc., and their neighboring effect between bases at a certain distance apart in a sequence. The next step is to use the variables selected by genetic algorithm (GA) to construct prediction models of retention times of oligonucleotides based on support vector machine (SVM). Accordingly, GA-SVM models give different prediction performance using different input descriptors resulting from different step lengths in the ACC transformation, indicating the neighboring effect between bases should not be neglected in the features related to the chromatographic retention of oligonucleotides. As a whole, the GA-SVM predictors obtained from more than 20 training samples can produce satisfying performance in predicting the chromatographic retention of oligonucleotides at a range of temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C), respectively. The present approach based on the SGBP-ACC-GA-SVM combination shows great application prospect in the field of separation and analysis science, bioinformatics and proteomics.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the efficacy of porcine small intestinal submucosa in corneal reconstructive surgery in dogs and cats through a large retrospective study. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 106 cases of surgical reconstruction of the cornea with small intestinal submucosa seen between May 2005 and January 2010 was carried out. The corneal defect was filled by microsurgical grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa. The biomaterial implant was deposited in one or several layers depending on the depth of the defect. The animals were examined 3, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Results: Vision was preserved in all eyes at three months post-surgery. In 74 cases (69.8%) the corneal scar was either transparent or discrete, whilst in 32 cases (30.2%) a mild or marked scar was observed. Minor complications occurred in 9 cases (8.5%) with partial integration of the small intestinal submucosa and in 24 cases (22.6%) with faint or mild corneal pigmentation, without impairing vision. In cases followed over a period longer than three months, major complications occurred in five dogs resulting in vision impairment because of pronounced pigmentation. Clinical Significance: Corneal grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa is an effective method for corneal reconstruction resulting in corneal transparency in most cases. It is an excellent alternative to conventional conjunctival grafts.

AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.

AB  - Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.
