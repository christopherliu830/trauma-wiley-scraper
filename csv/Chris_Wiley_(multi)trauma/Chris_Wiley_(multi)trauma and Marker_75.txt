AB  - Abstract Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease in Malaysia. The symptoms of leptospirosis vary from mild nonspecific flu-like illness to a severe condition which is usually associated with serious complication and fatality. To study the protein expression profile of mild and severe leptospirosis, 15 paired sera were collected from the patients who were mildly infected and following that progressed to severe stage. The proteome profiles of mild and severe cases were studied using 2DE analysis in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression of proteins that were significantly different and had a fold difference of at least 2 had been identified and then validated using Western blot. Our study demonstrated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I), serum amyloid A (SAA), transferrin (TF), haptoglobin (HP) and transthyretin (TTR) have significantly different expression between mild and severe leptospirosis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suggested the expression of these five proteins were modulated by acute phase response signaling pathway. Besides that, a functional network of lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry that interconnects these five proteins with interactomes also had been predicted by this software. In conclusion, this finding supports the potential of these five proteins to be the biomarkers for mild and severe human leptospirosis.

AB  - Abstract Background Employer administrative files are an underutilized source of data in epidemiologic studies of occupational injuries. Methods Personnel files, occupational health surveillance data, industrial hygiene data, and a real-time incident and injury management system from a large multi-site aluminum manufacturer were linked deterministically. An ecological-level measure of physical job demand was also linked. This method successfully created a database containing over 100 variables for 9,101 hourly employees from eight geographically dispersed U.S. plants. Results Between 2002 and 2004, there were 3,563 traumatic injuries to 2,495 employees. The most common injuries were sprain/strains (32%), contusions (24%), and lacerations (14%). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that physical job demand was the strongest predictor of injury risk, in a dose dependent fashion. Other strong predictors of injury included female gender, young age, short company tenure and short time on current job. Conclusions Employer administrative files are a useful source of data, as they permit the exploration of risk factors and potential confounders that are not included in many population-based surveys. The ability to link employer administrative files with injury surveillance data is a valuable analysis strategy for comprehensively studying workplace injuries, identifying salient risk factors, and targeting workforce populations disproportionately affected.

AB  - Abstract Bone repair after trauma or surgical intervention involves a tightly regulated cascade of events that starts with hemostasis and an inflammatory response, which are critical for successful healing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are routinely prescribed for pain relief despite their potential inhibitory effect on bone repair. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of administration of the non-selective NSAID diclofenac in the inflammatory phase of bone repair in mice with or without lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Repair of femoral window defects was characterized using micro computed tomography imaging and histological analyses at 2 weeks postoperative. The data indicate (a) impaired bone regeneration associated with reduced osteoblast, osteoclast, and macrophage activity; (b) changes in the number, activity, and distribution of mast cells in regenerating bone; and (c) impaired angiogenesis due to a direct toxic effect of diclofenac on vascular endothelial cells. The results of this study provide strong evidence to support the conjecture that administration of NSAIDs in the first 2 weeks after orthopaedic surgery disrupts the healing cascade and exacerbates the negative effects of systemic inflammation on the repair process.

The aim of the study was to obtain detailed information on the state of preservation of these ?anatomical mummies? and the techniques used to prepare them. Relying on the existing literature, the examined specimens (five heads with necks, two busts and one heart) could be divided into three types of anatomical specimens: ?dry preparations,? ?corrosion preparations,? and ?organ preparations.? CT examination enabled the assessment of the exact features of each specimen, some of the preparation techniques applied, the presence of foreign bodies, and the use of substances to fill the blood vessels. All of the cases demonstrated an extremely good state of preservation. The study sheds new light on important-yet scarcely known-preparation techniques created for different anatomical demonstrations. Results of the CT investigation were consistent with the anatomical preservation methods described in 18th to 20th century literature, particularly those of Italy. Clin.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective This study investigated the effects of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) transplantation combined with low dose ultrashortwave (USW) radiation on functional recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n?=?64) were randomly divided into five groups: sham-operated, as well as control, USW, BMSCs, and BMSCs?+?USW that were subjected to spinal cord contusion. BMSCs were transplanted into rats in the BMSCs and BMSCs+USW groups, while those in the USW and BMSCs?+?USW were exposed to radiation; Basso?Beattie?Bresnahan (BBB) tests were performed before the operation and at 1-week intervals after SCI for 7 weeks. 7 weeks later, animals were assessed footprint pattern, motor evoked potential (MEP), histological features, and expression of the ED1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), markers of activated macrophages and astrocytes, respectively, in the lesion area. BBB scores were higher in the BMSCs?+?USW than in the BMSCs and control groups. The USW and BMSCs?+?USW groups had improved coordination compared to the BMSCs and control groups (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively, vs. control). BMSCs?+?USW rats had a lower ratio of lesion/cavity to spinal cord area than the other injured rats, and also had expression of GFAP in transplanted BMSCs. All treatment groups had lower ED1 expression and MEP latency than the controls (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively). The results indicate that BMSCs transplantation combined with USW radiation is more effective than either treatment alone in promoting functional recovery after SCI, possibly due to concomitant suppression of inflammation and spinal cord repair.

AB  - Abstract Although the effects of group-based victimhood on attitudes and emotions have been demonstrated in previous research, the ways it affects cognitive processes remain unclear. Four studies examined how a perpetual ingroup victimhood orientation (PIVO) affects cognitive biases. High levels of PIVO were associated with the categorization of more outgroups as hostile to the ingroup, and more rapid responses when using an enmity criterion (Study 1). PIVO was also associated with more attributions of malevolent intentions and fewer attributions of neutral intentions to outgroup members in ambiguous situations (Study 2a); when primed with reminders of historical group trauma, attribution of malevolent intentions increased among high- but not low- PIVO individuals (Study 2b). However, the effect extended to all participants when using a larger sample (Study 2c). The implications of these categorization and attributional biases are discussed in particular as regards the self-perpetuating nature of perceived group victimhood.

AB  - Abstract The genome of the yeast Candida albicans harbours many genomic short sequence repeats (SSRs). These are stable upon transition of colonization to infection in immune-compromised patients. We show here that in non-neutropenic patients this transition may coincide with variation in several of the SSRs. This may have implications for stage-specific expression of C. albicans pathogenicity factors. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary Treatment of the different types of equine sinusitis, in particular those of chronic (>2 months' duration) sinusitis can be difficult, with many such cases not responding to more conservative measures such as rest, antibiotic therapy or sinus lavage. Such refractory cases require further clinical examinations and imaging as outlined in a companion article to achieve confirmation of the cause of the sinusitis. Many sinusitis cases will then require some form of surgical treatment that may include sinusotomy, dental extraction or intrasinus growth removal, that are increasingly being performed by less invasive techniques under standing sedation.

AB  - Summary Effects of the impact of a mechanical structure on the human body are of great interest in the understanding of body trauma. Experimental tests have led to first conclusions about the dangerousness of an impact observing impact forces or displacement time history with PMHS (Post Mortem human Subjects). They have allowed providing interesting data for the development and the validation of numerical biomechanical models. These models, widely used in the framework of automotive crashworthiness, have led to the development of numerical-based injury criteria and tolerance thresholds. The aim of this process is to improve the safety of mechanical structures in interaction with the body. In a military context, investigations both at experimental and numerical level are less successfully completed. For both military and civil frameworks, the literature list a number of numerical analysis trying to propose injury mechanisms, and tolerance thresholds based on biofidelic Finite Element (FE) models of different part of the human body. However the link between both frameworks is not obvious, since lots of parameters are different: great mass impacts at relatively low velocity for civil impacts (falls, automotive crashworthiness) and low mass at very high velocity for military loadings (ballistic, blast). In this study, different accident cases were investigated, and replicated with a previously developed and validated FE model of the human thorax named Hermaphrodite Universal Biomechanical YX model (HUBYX model). These previous validations included replications of standard experimental tests often used to validate models in the context of automotive industry, experimental ballistic tests in high speed dynamic impact and also numerical replication of blast loading test ensuring its biofidelity. In order to extend the use of this model in other frameworks, some real-world accidents were reconstructed, and consequences of these loadings on the FE model were explored. These various numerical replications of accident coming from different contexts raise the question about the ability of a FE model to correctly predict several kinds of trauma, from blast or ballistic impacts to falls, sports or automotive ones in a context of numerical injury mechanisms and tolerance limits investigations.

AB  - The pathology of cardiac disease includes genetic, physical, biochemical, psychological, social, and environmental vectors. Factors contributing to suicide have been identified in these same areas. Survival from an acute cardiac event requires a systematized and multisectoral response. Communities that do not have systematized response capabilities to acute cardiac events have poorer survival outcomes. Suicide prevention and control may also be responsive to an integrated community response system. This paper examines the development of a community cardiac care model, explores potential parallels for a community suicide prevention and control model, and outlines a general systems theory framework for a suicide prevention and control system.

AB  - Abstract Dental stem cells for dental pulp regeneration have become a new strategy for pulpitis treatment. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis play a vital role in the pulp-dentin complex regeneration, and appropriate growth factors will promote the process of angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) is involved in the regulation of tooth growth and development. A previous study showed that IGFBP5 enhanced osteo/odontogenic differentiation of dental stem cells. Our research intends to reveal the function of IGFBP5 in the angiogenic and neurogenic differentiation of human dental stem cells. Human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were used in the present study. Lentiviral IGFBP5 shRNA was used to silence the IGFBP5. Retroviruses expressing Wild-type IGFBP5 were used to over-express IGFBP5. Angiogenic and neurogenic differentiation were carried out by in vitro study. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot results showed that over-expression of IGFBP5 upregulated the expressions of angiogenic markers, including VEGF, PDGFA and ANG-1, and neurogenic markers, including NCAM, TH, Nestin, ?III-tubulin, and TH, in DPSCs. Moreover, microscope observation confirmed that over-expression of IGFBP5 enhanced neurosphere formation in DPSCs in size and amount. Immunofluorescence staining results showed that over-expression of IGFBP5 also prompted the percentage of Nestin and ?III-tubulin positive neurospheres in DPSCs. While depletion of IGFBP5 downregulated the expressions of VEGF, PDGFA, ANG-1, NCAM, TH, Nestin, ?III-tubulin, and TH, it decreased the neurosphere formation and percentage of Nestin and ?III-tubulin positive neurospheres in DPSCs. In conclusion, our results revealed that IGFBP5 promoted angiogenic and neurogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs in vitro and provided the possible potential target for enhancing directed differentiation of dental stem cells and dental pulp-dentin functional regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in infants and children with acute lung injury (ALI), and to investigate associations between BNP levels and clinical outcome. Design Prospective observational study. Subjects After informed consent, plasma was collected from 48 pediatric patients on day 1 of ALI. Methodology Plasma BNP levels were measured by immunoassay on day 1 of ALI in 48 pediatric patients. Associations between BNP levels and outcome were determined. Results The mean PaO2/FiO2 at the onset of ALI was 155 (±74) and BNP values ranged from 5 to 2,060?pg/ml with a mean of 109 (±311). BNP levels were inversely correlated with ventilator-free days (Spearman rho ?0.30, P?=?0.04), and positively correlated with exhaled tidal volume (Spearman rho 0.44, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were higher in patients receiving inotropic support (n?=?12) than patients not receiving inotropic support (n?=?33, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were correlated with PRISM III scores (Spearman rho 0.55, P?<?0.001) and PELOD scores (Spearman rho 0.4, P?=?0.006). Mortality for the cohort was 15%. BNP levels were higher in non-survivors (n?=?7) than survivors (n?=?41, P?=?0.055). Conclusions BNP levels are elevated in children with ALI/ARDS early in the disease course, and increased levels are associated with worse clinical outcome.
