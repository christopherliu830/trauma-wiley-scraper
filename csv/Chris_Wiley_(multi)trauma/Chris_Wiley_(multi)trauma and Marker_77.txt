AB  - Abstract Many children living in homeless situations in the U.S. have temporary stays in foster care, and both populations suffer disproportionately higher rates of physical, psychological and social difficulties compared with other children. However, very little is known about which specific interventions achieve the best outcomes for children in these overlapping transitional living situations. To address this gap, we review existing literature to identify the most promising practices for children living in transition. A standardised vocabulary specific to each of three electronic databases (i.e. Medline, PsychINFO and CINAHL) was employed to identify studies that described an intervention specifically targeting foster care or homeless children and families. Separate systematic searches were conducted for homeless and foster children, and only studies published in English between January 1993 and February 2009 were selected. The final sample (n?=?43) of articles described interventions that fell into two categories: mental health (n?=?17) and case management (n?=?26). No article included a sample containing both homeless and foster care children, and most studies on homeless children used case management interventions while most studies on foster care children focused on mental health interventions. Few articles employed rigorous study designs. Although repeatedly studies have demonstrated the overlap between populations of homeless and foster care children, studies focused on one population or the other. Virtually all studies on both homeless and foster children devised interventions to reduce trauma and family instability; yet, no evidence-based practice addresses the overlapping needs and potentially relevant evidence-based practice for these two populations. An important and vital next step is to establish an effective evidence-based intervention that reduces the impact of trauma on both U.S. populations of children living in transition.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Abstract Vulvodynia in young women is a significant clinical challenge. This overview focuses on localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV) with regard to medical and physical predictors of the condition. Several causative factors have been proposed and one major conceptual issue is the role of inflammation. Trauma to the vestibular mucosa causes an initial inflammatory response which may result in peripheral and central pain sensitization. In women with LPV, evidence of mucosal nerve fiber proliferation and enhanced systemic pain perception has been found. A dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles is common and many patients also suffer from other bodily pain. In general, the level of scientific quality in published studies on vulvodynia is low. Further research on epidemiology, etiology and conduction of clinical trials with high evidence grade is desired.

AB  - Background Terrorist attacks have been shown to precipitate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology in children and adolescents, particularly among youths with high exposure to media coverage surrounding such events. Media exposure may be particularly likely to trigger PTSD symptoms in youths with high physiological reactivity to stress or with prior psychopathology or exposure to violence. We examined the interplay between media exposure, preattack psychopathology, autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity, and prior violence exposure in predicting PTSD symptom onset following the terrorist attack at the 2013 Boston Marathon. Methods A community sample of 78 adolescents (mean age = 16.7 years, 65% female) completed a survey about the bombings, including media exposure to the event and PTSD symptoms. All respondents participated in a study assessing psychopathology prior to the attack, and sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity to a laboratory-based stressor was assessed in a subset (N = 44) of this sample. We examined the associations of media exposure, ANS reactivity, preattack psychopathology, and prior violence exposure with onset of PTSD symptoms related to the bombings. Results Media exposure, preattack psychopathology, and prior violence exposure were associated with PTSD symptoms. Moreover, media exposure interacted with sympathetic reactivity to predict PTSD symptom onset, such that adolescents with lower levels of sympathetic reactivity developed PTSD symptoms only following high exposure to media coverage of the attack. Conclusions We provide novel evidence that physiological reactivity prior to exposure to an unpredictable traumatic stressor predicts PTSD symptom onset. These findings have implications for identifying youths most vulnerable to PTSD following wide-scale trauma.

AB  - Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon disease marked by clotting of blood in cerebral venous, or dural sinuses, and, in rare cases, cortical veins. It is a rare but potentially fatal cause of acute neurological deterioration previously related to otomastoid, orbit, and central face cutaneous infections. After the advent of antibiotics, it is more often related to neoplasm, pregnancy, puerperium, systemic diseases, dehydration, intracranial tumors, oral contraceptives, and coagulopathies are the most common causes, but in 30% of cases no underlying etiology can be identified. It has been found in association with fibrous thyroiditis, jugular thrombosis after catheterization, or idiopathic jugular vein stenosis. Other factors include surgery, head trauma, arterio-venous malformations, infection, paraneoplastic, and autoimmune disease. This article presents a comprehensive review of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis etiologies.

AB  - In this era of globalization, when news about political violence can haunt anyone, anywhere, those whose families have suffered political violence in the past are particularly vulnerable to current distress. Skilled in understanding transgenerational processes, family therapists need to befamiliar with the mechanisms by which children are exposed to the effects of political violence suffered by their elders-that is, the ways in which they become their witnesses. This article presents a framework for understanding how the trauma of political violence experienced in one generation can ?pass? to another that did not directly experienced it, and proposes a model to guide clinical intervention.

AB  - Summary The study of stress, fear and anxiety was the major focus of research among the early neuroscientists interested in behaviour. This is not surprising because fear, anxiety and alarm play a fundamental role in survival. Thus, research investigating the phenomenology and neurobiology of anxiety, fear, startle, arousal, alarm, vigilance and alerting functions has been conducted for decades. This chapter provides an overview of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder. These anxiety disorders were selected because each of them has an extensive base of knowledge in two or more of the following areas: neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology or neuroimmunology, and neurophysiology.

AB  - Abstract Neuroblastoma is one of the most intensely studied solid malignancies that affect the pediatric age groups; its clinical presentation, treatment strategies and ultimate prognosis vary greatly. The biologic and genetic character of each tumor has an important impact on disease behavior, and clinical staging now incorporates these factors to generate an overall therapy plan. The clinical presentation of neuroblastoma is related to primary tumor location, production of metabolically active substances, and the presence of metastatic disease. There are also prognostically important associated syndromes including opsoclonus-myoclonus, Horner's syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and a variety of other neurocristopathies. The histologic features of the tumor are of prognostic significance and are utilized in treatment stratification. The International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) has unified classic clinical staging. Features at diagnosis and those determined by initial operation are combined with biologic prognostic factors to achieve risk group assignment for virtually all patients. There are groups of children in which limited therapy is curative and intermediate-risk situations where standard multimodality treatment provides favorable outcomes. Unfortunately, there are many patients with high-risk disease that require intensive strategies, but success is still limited. It is in these most resistant patients that innovative approaches are being undertaken and novel strategies are being investigated. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 16:91?104, 1999. ? 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.
