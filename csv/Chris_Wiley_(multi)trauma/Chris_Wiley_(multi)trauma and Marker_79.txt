AB  - Abstract Objective The Royal Perth Hospital (RPH; Perth, Australia) has been the receiving facility for burns patients in two separate disasters. In 2002, RPH received 28 severely injured burns patients after the Bali bombing, and in 2009 RPH received 23 significantly burnt patients as a result of an explosion on board a foreign vessel in the remote Ashmore Reef Islands (840?km west of Darwin). The aim of this paper is to identify the interventions developed following the Bali bombing in 2002 and review their effectiveness of their implementation in the subsequent burns disaster. Methods A comparative case study analysis using a standardised approach was used to describe context with debrief reports and ED photographs from both disasters used for evaluation. Results The implementation of regular ED disaster response planning and training, early Code Brown notification of the entire hospital with regular updates, early clearing of inpatient beds, use of Short Message Service to communicate regularly with ED staff, control of the public and media access to the ED, visual identification of staff within the ED, early panendoscopy to ascertain intubation needs, and senior clinical decision makers in all areas of the ED were all acknowledged as effective based on the debrief reports. There was a reduction in ED length of stay (150 to 55?min) and no deaths occurred; however, quantitative analysis can only be suggestive rather than a direct measure of improvement given the likelihood of other system changes. Conclusion There were a number of lessons observed from the Bali experience in 2002 that have led to improvements in practice and lessons learned.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Urethral strictures, bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and urorectal fistulation are three well-recognised complications of the treatment of prostate cancer, whether by surgery or non-surgical treatment. Because these are relatively rare problems the treatment is uncertain. There is a heavy reliance on endoscopic or instrumental management of urethral strictures and of bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and there is little discrimination in any of these conditions between those that are the result of surgery and those that are the result of radiotherapy and other treatment methods using external energy sources. This review aims to clarify out current understanding of these three clinical problems and draws attention to the role of reconstructive surgery, particularly when dealing with bladder neck contractures, prostatic urethral stenoses and urorectal fistula. This also shows that the nature of the problem, the recovery time after treatment and the degree of functional recovery is radically different in the surgical as against the non-surgical group, to a degree that the authors believe is not sufficiently stressed when patients are counselled and consented before their primary treatment. ?? To review the less common and not widely discussed, but much more serious complications of prostate cancer treatment of: urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture and urorectal fistula. ?? The treatment options for patients with organ-confirmed prostate cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy; with each method or combination of methods having associated complications. ?? Complications resulting from RP are relatively easy to manage, with rapid recovery and return to normal activities, and usually a return to normal bodily functions. ?? However, after non-surgical treatments, i.e. BT, EBRT, HIFU and cryotherapy, these same problems are more difficult to treat with a much slower return to a much lower level of function. ?? When counselling patients about the primary treatment of prostate cancer they should be advised that although the same type of complication may occur after surgical or non-surgical treatment, the scope and scale of that complication, the ease with which it is treated and the degree of restoration of normality after treatment, is altogether in favour of surgery in those for whom surgery is appropriate and who are fit for surgery.

AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The function of the dental pulp is closely connected to the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, and ECM has received significant attention due to its biological functions for regulating cells. As such, the interaction between the ECM niche and cells is worth exploring for potential clinical uses. Materials and methods In this study, dental pulp stem cell (DPSC)-derived ECM (DPM) was prepared through cell culture and decellularization to function as the cell niche, and changes in DPSC behaviour and histological analysis of dental pulp tissue regeneration were evaluated following the DPM culture. DPM promoted the replication of DPSCs and exhibited retention of their mineralization. Then, the DPM-based culture strategy under odontogenic culture medium was further investigated, and the mineralization-related markers showed that DPSCs were regulated towards odontogenic differentiation. Dental pulp-like tissue with well-arranged ECM was harvested after a 2-month subcutaneous implantation in nude mice with DPM application. Additionally, DPSCs cultured on the plastic culture surface showed the up-regulation of mineralization makers in vitro, but there was a disorder in matrix formation and mineralization when the cells were cultured in vivo. Results and Conclusions DPM-based cultivation could serve as a cell niche and modulate DPSC behaviour, and this method also provided an alternative to harvest tissue-specific ECM and provided a strategy for ECM-cell interaction.

To elucidate possible treatment-related etiological factors ? such as, duration of treatment and apical displacement ? for external root resorption. Design ? Meta-analysis of the available English-language literature. Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria ? Papers with a sample size >10, fixed appliances, pre- and post-operative radiographs, and apical displacement recorded were included. History of trauma, prior root resorption and endodontic treatment were excluded. Appropriateness of these selections was tested with a ?funnel plot? analysis. Outcome Measure ? Correlations between root resorption, apical displacement, and treatment duration. Results ? Mean apical root resorption was strongly correlated with total apical displacement (r?=?0.822) and treatment duration (r?=?0.852). Conclusion ? The treatment-related causes of root resorption appear to be the total distance the apex had moved and the time it took.

AB  - Abstract Muscle satellite cells are believed to represent a committed stem cell population that is responsible for the postnatal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle. However, the observation that cultured myoblasts differentiate into osteocytes or adipocytes following treatment with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) or adipogenic inducers, respectively, suggests some degree of plasticity within the mesenchymal lineage. To further investigate this phenomenon, we explore the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of satellite cells isolated from adult mice. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts, expressing myogenic markers such as MyoD, Myf5, Pax7 and desmin, differentiated only into osteocytes or adipocytes following treatment with BMPs or adipogenic inducers, respectively. However, satellite cells on isolated muscle fibers cultured in Matrigel readily differentiated into myocytes as well as osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, whereas primary myoblasts did not. Satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts isolated from mice lacking the myogenic transcription factor MyoD (MyoD-/-) differentiate into myocytes poorly in vivo and in vitro (Megeney et al., Genes Dev. 1996; Sabourin et. al, J. Cell Biol., 1999). Therefore, we tested whether MyoD-/- primary myoblasts display increased plasticity relative to wild type cells. Unexpectedly, the osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation potential of MyoD-/- primary myoblasts did not increase compared to wild-type cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that muscle satellite cells possess multipotential mesenchymal stem cell activity and are capable of forming osteocytes and adipocytes as well as myocytes.

AB  - Aims Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness, spasticity, paralysis and death usually within 2?5 years of onset. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS pathology characterized by activation of glial cells, which respond by upregulating small heat shock proteins (HSPBs), but the exact underlying pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the association between ALS disease duration, lower motor neuron loss, TARDNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, neuroinflammation and HSPB expression. Methods With immunohistochemistry, we examined HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB6, HSPB8 and HSP16.2 expression in cervical, thoracic and sacral spinal cord regions in 12 ALS cases, seven with short disease duration (SDD), five with moderate disease duration (MDD), and ten age-matched controls. Expression was quantified using ImageJ to examine HSP expression, motor neuron numbers, microglial and astrocyte density and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43+) inclusions. Results SDD was associated with elevated HSPB5 and 8 expression in lateral tract astrocytes, while HSP16.2 expression was increased in astrocytes in MDD cases. SDD cases had higher numbers of motor neurons and microglial activation than MDD cases, but similar levels of motor neurons with pTDP-43+ inclusions. Conclusions Increased expression of several HSPBs in lateral column astrocytes suggests that astrocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. SDD is associated with increased microgliosis, HSPB5 and 8 expression in astrocytes, and only minor changes in motor neuron loss. This suggests that the interaction between motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes determines neuronal fate and functional decline in ALS.

AB  - Abstract One hundred and forty-seven patients with splenic injury admitted to 18 different hospitals were included in a prospective multicentre study. The spleen was saved in 64 per cent. Out of the total series, 43 per cent of patients were not operated upon, 5 per cent had exploratory laparotomy only, and in 16 per cent splenic repair was performed. Treatment is discussed with reference to the nature of the splenic lesion, concomitant injuries, amount of blood transfusion given, and age of the patient. No deaths were definitely related to the splenic injury. The frequency of serious recurrent bleeding was not higher in the splenic salvage group when compared with the splenectomy group. Delayed bleeding was detected in 4 per cent of the patients. The mode of treatment varied considerably in different hospitals in that conservative treatment was performed in 14, splenic repair in 10 and splenectomy in 12 hospitals. Splenic salvage seems safe in most patients with a splenic injury. However, meticulous surveillance of the patient is mandatory.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was initially developed for the treatment of calcific aortic stenosis. In the recent years, however, TAVI has been used to treat selected patients with pure, severe AR. We report successful transfemoral implantation of a Symetis ACURATE neo bioprosthesis in a severely symptomatic, 87-year-old woman with pure AR and major comorbidities. We decided to use the ACURATE neo bioprosthesis for some of its features appeared to us as potentially useful in the setting of pure AR: the stabilization arches ensure perfect coaxial alignment and extreme stability of the device during deployment, and the ?waist? and the skirt were considered useful to obtain a good seal in the absence of significant valvular and annular calcifications. Finally, we decided to use a self-expanding valve to minimize the trauma to the aortic annulus. The procedure was successful and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 3. At the 3-month control echocardiography, there was no residual AR, and the mean transprosthetic gradient was 3 mm Hg. The current case demonstrates that percutaneous TAVI with the ACURATE neo bioprosthesis may be used to treat pure, isolated AR in selected patients. The device has several interesting features that could make it advantageous in this setting. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Biological psychiatry has four principal modes of investigation but each has been flawed by errors in procedure and inference such that the bulk of existing findings must be called into question. Pedigree studies are ruined by selective adoption, the use of ?throw-away kids? to demonstrate so-called genetic effects, lack of case history data, and lapses in ?blind? diagnosis. In particular, the Danish adoption studies are challenged, despite the field's insistence that this research has settled the nature-nurture controversy in schizophrenia. Pharmacological-response studies are the next line of methodology and these are marred by a spurious assumption that drugs which work must be correcting a biochemical imbalance that causes the condition. Thirdly, neuropsychological-neurophysiological studies are ?heuristic? fishing-expeditions to find a presumed abnormality to account for psychopathology, without doing the prospective longitudinal research necessary to validate such theory. Lastly, biochemical correlates of emotion are treated as if each emotion must have a distinct neuronal substrate rather than possibly representing a general visceral arousal where cognition defines the feeling. All told, biological psychiatry is often more reductionist than acknowledged, does not come up to current scientific standards, and uncritically cites work which is, or should be, discredited. At the heart of the problem is an implicit ideology within biological psychiatry, with insufficient awareness of its social ramifications: ?blaming the victim's body? protects the status quo by holding protoplasm at fault for maladjustment rather than the person, family, or community.

AB  - Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide range of disabilities that cause life-long cognitive impairment and social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are important for improving the life quality of autistic patients. However, in the current practice, diagnosis often has to be delayed until the behavioral symptoms become evident during childhood. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for identifying high-risk ASD infants at as early as six months after birth. This is based on the observation that ASD-induced abnormalities in white matter (WM) tracts and whole-brain connectivity have already started to appear within 24 months after birth. In particular, we propose a novel multikernel support vector machine classification framework by using the connectivity features gathered from WM connectivity networks, which are generated via multiscale regions of interest (ROIs) and multiple diffusion statistics such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and average fiber length. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76% and an area of 0.80 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in comparison to the accuracy of 70% and the AUC of 70% provided by the best single-parameter single-scale network. The improvement in accuracy is mainly due to the complementary information provided by multiparameter multiscale networks. In addition, our framework also provides the potential imaging connectomic markers and an objective means for early ASD diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4880?4896, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Youth development and violence prevention are two sides of the same public policy. The focus of much theoretical and empirical effort is identifying delinquency risks and intervening. Given the great costs of homicide and the historically high nationwide prison population, new policies must address increasing violence and rising expenses. Treatments of prenatal care, home visitation, bullying prevention, alcohol-substance abuse education, alternative thinking promotion, mentoring, life skills training, rewards for graduation and employment, functional family and multi-systemic therapy, and multi-dimensional foster care are effective, because they ameliorate age-specific risks for delinquency. At present, these interventions only yield a 10?40% diversion from crime however. Returns on investment (ROIs) vary from $1 to $98. Targeting empirical treatments to those determined to be most at risk, based on statistical models or actuarial testing, and using electronic surveillance for non-violent prisoners significantly diverted youth from violence, improving ROI, while simultaneously saving costs.
