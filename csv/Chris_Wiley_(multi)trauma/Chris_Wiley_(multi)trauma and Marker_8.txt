AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury can cause extensive damage to the white matter (WM) of the brain. These disruptions can be especially damaging in children, whose brains are still maturing. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most commonly used method to assess WM organization, but it has limited resolution to differentiate causes of WM disruption. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields spectra showing the levels of neurometabolites that can indicate neuronal/axonal health, inflammation, membrane proliferation/turnover, and other cellular processes that are on-going post-injury. Previous analyses on this dataset revealed a significant division within the msTBI patient group, based on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT); one subgroup of patients (TBI-normal) showed evidence of recovery over time, while the other showed continuing degeneration (TBI-slow). We combined dMRI with MRS to better understand WM disruptions in children with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). Tracts with poorer WM organization, as shown by lower FA and higher MD and RD, also showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal and axonal health and myelination. We did not find lower NAA in tracts with normal WM organization. Choline, a marker of inflammation, membrane turnover, or gliosis, did not show such associations. We further show that multi-modal imaging can improve outcome prediction over a single modality, as well as over earlier cognitive function measures. Our results suggest that demyelination plays an important role in WM disruption post-injury in a subgroup of msTBI children and indicate the utility of multi-modal imaging.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

KW  - necrotizing fasciitis
KW  - face
PY  - 1992
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but well recognized clinical entity which most often occurs on the trunk, perineum or legs following surgery or trauma. The condition is much less common in the head and neck and it is particularly uncommon in the midface/periorbital region. In almost all the cases occurring in the neck the condition follows obvious dental or oropharyngeal sepsis and in all the cases of the scalp there is a history of previous surgery or trauma. However, necrotizing fasciitis of the midface/periorbital region may lack any obvious traumatic aetiology or may follow relatively minor trauma. The diagnosis in these cases may not be suspected and treatment may be delayed with fatal consequences. Treatment by wide excision of all affected skin can lead to disastrous cosmetic consequences in facial disease and it is suggested that disease control can be achieved by raising wide based skin flaps with excision of the underlying necrotic tissue. The flaps are then returned onto normal muscle with much improved cosmetic results. This paper discusses the diagnosis and treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the face which has arisen without significant trauma.

AB  - Objective To describe clinical use of computed tomography (CT) and hoof surface markers to facilitate internal fixation within the confines of the hoof wall. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Horses (n?=?16) that had CT-guided internal fixation of the distal phalanx (DP) or distal sesamoid bone (DSB). Methods Drill bit entry point and direction were planned from CT image series performed on hooves with grids of barium paste dots at proposed entry and projected exit sites. Post-implantation CT images were obtained to check screw position and length as well as fracture reduction. Imaging, reduction, and surgical and general anesthesia times were evaluated. Outcome was recorded. Results Screw position and length were considered near optimal in all horses, with no consequential malposition of bits or screws. Fracture reduction was evident in all cases. Preoperative planning times (at least 2 CT image acquisitions and grid creation) ranged from 10 to 20?minutes. Surgery time ranged from 45 to 90?minutes (mean, 61?minutes) and general anesthesia time ranged from 115 to 220?minutes (mean, 171?minutes). Conclusions The combination of CT and surface marker grids allowed accurate positioning of screws in clinical DP and DSB fractures. The technique was simple and rapid. An aiming device is useful for the technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Human carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated sarcomeric mutations have abnormal collagen metabolism before overt left ventricular hypertrophy is detectable. This study investigated whether differences in collagen biomarkers were present in blood samples of ragdoll cats positive for the MYBPC3:R820W mutation compared with negative controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS Linear regression analyses showed that genotype was independently associated with CITP concentration. CITP was higher in mutation carriers (25?·?4?µg/L, interquartile range 16?·?0?29?·?2?µg/L) than non-carriers (14?·?6?µg/L, interquartile range 9?·?38?19?·?2?µg/L; P?=?0?·?024). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Circulating CITP was higher in MYBPC3-positive ragdoll cats than negative controls and may indicate altered collagen metabolism. Further studies are necessary to determine whether alterations in circulating collagen biomarker concentration relate to an early stage of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Objective:? To study the usefulness of a trivalent gold salt, gold trichloride (GTC), as a marker for contact allergy to gold. Method: Patients patch test positive or negative to gold sodium thiosulfate (GSTS), 13 subjects of each, were patch-tested with dilution series of GTC and equimolar concentrations of GSTS; each series started at 0.03?mM and contained 5 steps. In order to avoid false positive and false negative test reactions the salts were dissolved in an alkaline buffer and placed on van der Bend? polypropene chambers. The tests were applied for 48?h; reading was blinded and performed on D3 and D7. Results:? Allergic reactions were observed in 9/13 gold-allergic patients with GSTS and in 2/13 with GTC. The sum of positive reactions was 18 with GSTS and 5 with GTC. Primary toxic reactions: 0 with GSTS and 2 with GTC among the gold-allergic patients; and 2 with GSTS and 1 with GTC among the controls. Conclusion:? GTC can elicit positive patch test reactions in patients with gold allergy but to a lesser degree than GSTS. GTC cannot be recommended for patch testing.

AB  - Abstract Childhood trauma is associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. Mechanisms for these associations are not well understood because past studies have focused predominantly on populations that have already developed physical and mental health problems. The present study examined the association between childhood trauma and stress-related vulnerability factors in a healthy adult sample (n = 79; 68% female, mean age = 27.5, SD = 6.5). Emotion regulation difficulties were examined as a potential mediator. Participants completed baseline laboratory assessments of reported childhood trauma, emotion regulation difficulties, prior month sleep quality, baseline impedance cardiography, and behavioral tests of executive functioning (EF) and a three-day experience sampling assessment protocol that included sleep diary, reported and objective pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood abuse was significantly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation, self-report and objective pre-sleep arousal, diary-assessed sleep quality, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood neglect was associated with greater pre-sleep arousal and poorer EF-behavioral control. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between childhood abuse and reported pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. In conclusion, history of childhood trauma is associated with a variety of stress-related vulnerability factors in healthy adults that may be viable early intervention targets.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Trauma research has identified a link between parental adjustment and children?s functioning and the sometimes ensuing intergenerational impact of traumatic events. The effects of traumatic events on children have been demonstrated to be mediated through their impact on children?s parents. However, until now, little consideration has been given to the separate and more proximal mechanism of parenting practices as potential mediators between children?s adjustment and traumatic events. To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts. Using a social interaction learning perspective (Forgatch  Patterson, 2005), we propose a prevention research framework to examine the role that parenting practices may play in influencing children?s adjustment in the wake of trauma exposure. The article concludes by providing a specific model and role for evidence-based parenting interventions for children exposed to mass trauma.

AB  - Abstract Plantation-grown trees have to cope with an increasing pressure of pest and disease in the context of climate change, and breeding approaches using genomics may offer efficient and flexible tools to face this pressure. In the present study, we targeted genetic improvement of resistance of an introduced conifer species in Canada, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), to the native white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck). We developed single- and multi-trait genomic selection (GS) models and selection indices considering the relationships between weevil resistance, intrinsic wood quality, and growth traits. Weevil resistance, acoustic velocity as a proxy for mechanical wood stiffness, and average wood density showed moderate-to-high heritability and low genotype-by-environment interactions. Weevil resistance was genetically positively correlated with tree height, height-to-diameter at breast height (DBH) ratio, and acoustic velocity. The accuracy of the different GS models tested (GBLUP, threshold GBLUP, Bayesian ridge regression, BayesCπ) was high and did not differ among each other. Multi-trait models performed similarly as single-trait models when all trees were phenotyped. However, when weevil attack data were not available for all trees, weevil resistance was more accurately predicted by integrating genetically correlated growth traits into multi-trait GS models. A GS index that corresponded to the breeders? priorities achieved near maximum gains for weevil resistance, acoustic velocity, and height growth, but a small decrease for DBH. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to breed for high-quality, weevil-resistant Norway spruce reforestation stock with high accuracy achieved from single-trait or multi-trait GS.

Two measures were created to understand the levels of aggression teachers report occurs in their classrooms and to understand how teachers interact with media related to school shootings. Both ISSM and ATT were associated with higher levels of STSS. Lockdown drills did not appear to interact with these relationships to either strengthen or weaken them. Considering the importance of teachers? well-being and how it influences their ability to be effective teachers, continued investigation is warranted.

AB  - Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. On occasion, KS may histologically mimic pyogenic granulomas (PG), a common benign vascular tumor of the skin. Using immunoperoxidase stains, we examined 28 PG and 4 PG-like KS for HHV-8 to determine the specificity of positive staining in this setting. All PG-like KS demonstrated nuclear staining for HHV-8. No staining was identified in any of the PG. Furthermore, histologic criteria often used to differentiate between these two entities were not helpful in difficult cases. The only distinguishing features were the presence/absence of HHV-8 staining and, in some cases, clinical history. The presence of HHV-8 nuclear staining appears to be a specific marker for KS when comparing PG and PG-like KS. Given the lack of distinguishing morphologic criteria, we suggest performing immunoperoxidase stains for HHV-8 on any PG occurring in a clinically atypical setting.

AB  - Abstract: The methods adopted in the appraisal of the trauma of three communities after different disasters in the South Pacific are described and discussed. The outcome affirms the need for non-indigenous clinicians to be ready to adjust their concepts and methods to suit the cultural frameworks they encounter when they are invited abroad, and for local health professionals to be ready to share their knowledge and skills with their collegues from abroad. The outcome, it is argued, should improve the quality of service provided at all stages of disaster recovery, and still enable questions to be raised about matters of fundamental concern ? such as the power of religious belief and of social justice in the process of healing. These questions were found to be of particular importance in the context of the South Pacific cultures.

AB  - Three patients arc reported, each with a reddish macule or plaque (7?10 mm) induced by trauma. The histology of these lesions showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and marked dilation of vessels in the papillary to deep dermis. The electron microscopic study revealed a layer of endothelial cells surrounding the dilated vessels, suggestive of telangiectasia. The relationship between this entity and solitary angiokcratoma is discussed.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - Abstract. This report from the first International Course on Integrated Biomarkers, Biochemical and Bioimaging Endpoints in Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Prevention, Therapy and Drug Development provides the basis for optimizing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information in four areas of cardiovascular medicine: primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and stroke. Risk stratification and treatment strategies can be refined and enhanced through integration of bioimaging and biochemical markers to characterize sub-clinical and clinical atherosclerosis. For the integrative approach to be useful, each of the biomarkers must be validated and cost-effective. Clinical decision is the primary level of integration and is based on clinical evaluation and the use of a combination of bioimaging and biochemical markers. The decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic intervention must take into account the factors affecting the levels of expression of the biomarker and the potential input the biomarker has on metabolic processes or modulation of other biomarkers. The optimal approach to intervention must take into consideration the risk?benefit and cost?effectiveness ratios.

AB  - Background To date there are no biomarkers with proven reliability as a measure of disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of our study is to assess the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a measure of disease activity and progression in ALS. Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ALS, 25 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and 21 with other neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated. CSF NFL levels were assayed by two-site solid-phase sandwich ELISA. In patients with ALS, neurological status was assessed by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) and the Medical Research Council scale, and the progression of the disease was evaluated using the ?diagnostic delay? and the ?progression rate?. Results Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were higher in ALS cases than in controls (P < 0.0001). Using receiver operating curve analysis, an optimal NFL cut-off of 1981 ng/l discriminated between patients with ALS and neurological controls, with a sensitivity of 78.4% and specificity of 72.5%. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed the association between CSF NFL levels and the presence of ALS (age and sex adjusted odds ratio for ALS 8.9; 95% CI 3.1?25.8; P < 0.0001). In ALS, CSF NFL negatively correlated with the diagnostic delay (P < 0.0001) and the ALSFRS-r (P = 0.014) and positively with the progression rate (P < 0.0001). Conclusions High CSF NFL levels were found in patients with ALS, reflecting the burden of neurodegeneration. The significant relation between CSF NFL levels and disease progression suggests that NFL may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in ALS.
