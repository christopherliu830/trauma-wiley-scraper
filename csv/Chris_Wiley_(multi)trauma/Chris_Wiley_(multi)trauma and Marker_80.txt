AB  - Repetition of jumps in dance and sport training poses a potential injury risk; however, non-contact landing injuries are more common in athletes than dancers. This study aimed to compare the lower limb stiffness characteristics of dancers and athletes during drop landings to investigate possible mechanisms of impact-related injuries. Kinematics and kinetics were recorded as 39 elite modern and ballet dancers (19 men and 20 women) and 40 college-level team sport athletes (20 men and 20 women) performed single-legged drop landings from a 30-cm platform. Vertical leg stiffness and joint stiffness of the hip, knee, and ankle were calculated using a spring-mass model. Stiffness data, joint kinematics, and moments were compared with a group-by-sex 2-way analysis of variance. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relative contribution of hip and knee and ankle joint stiffness to variance in overall vertical leg stiffness for dancers and athletes. Dancers had lower leg (P < 0.001), knee joint (P = 0.034), and ankle joint stiffness (P = 0.043) than athletes. This was facilitated by lower knee joint moments (P = 0.012) and greater knee (P = 0.029) and ankle joint (P = 0.048) range of motion in dancers. Males had higher leg (P < 0.001) and ankle joint stiffness (P < 0.001) than females. This occurred through lower ankle range of motion (P < 0.001) and greater ankle moment (P = 0.022) compared to females. Male and female dancers demonstrated reduced lower limb stiffness compared to athletes, indicating a more pliable landing technique. Dance training techniques could potentially inform approaches to injury prevention in athletes.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Summary Hordenine is an alkaloid occurring naturally in grains, sprouting barley, and certain grasses. It is occasionally found in post race urine samples, and therefore we investigated its pharmacological actions in the horse. Hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bodyweight [bwt]) was administered by rapid intravenous (iv) injection to 10 horses. Typically, dosed horses showed a flehmen response and defecated within 60 secs. All horses showed substantial respiratory distress. Respiratory rates increased about 250 per cent and heart rates were approximately double that of resting values. All animals broke out in a sweat shortly after iv injection, but basal body temperature was not affected. These effects were transient, and the animals appeared normal within 30 mins of dosing. Treated horses were tested in a variable interval responding apparatus 30 mins after dosing and no residual stimulation or depressant effects of hordenine were apparent. Animals dosed orally with 2.0 mg/kg bwt of hordenine showed no changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, basal body temperature or behaviour. After iv injection of hordenine, (2.0 mg/kg bwt) plasma reached a maximum value of about 1.0 ?g/ml, and declined thereafter in a biexponential fashion. Kinetics of plasma concentration satisfied the concept of a two compartment open system, with an α-phase half-life of about 3 mins, and a ß-phase half-life of about 35 mins. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 400 ?g/ml, and then declined exponentially to background levels by 24 h after dosing. Oral administration of hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bwt) showed peak plasma levels of about 0.15 ?g/ml 1 h after dosing, followed by a slow multi-exponential decline in blood levels of the drug. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 200 ?g/ml, remained at this level for about 8 h, and then declined to background levels. Plasma levels of hordenine were reflected by a kinetic model which assumed very slow absorption of hordenine from the gastrointestinal tract and no effect on behaviour, heart rate or respiratory rate were noted after oral administration. Because of the low plasma levels, it would appear to be particularly difficult to obtain a pharmacological effect of hordenine after oral administration.

AB  - Cartilage engineering facilitates repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage using engineered tissue that restores the functional properties of the impaired joint. The seed cells used most frequently in tissue engineering, are chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Seed cells activity plays a key role in the regeneration of functional cartilage tissue. However, seed cells undergo undesirable changes after in vitro processing procedures, such as degeneration of cartilage cells and induced hypertrophy of mesenchymal stem cells, which hinder cartilage tissue engineering. Compared to monoculture, which does not mimic the in vivo cellular environment, co-culture technology provides a more realistic microenvironment in terms of various physical, chemical, and biological factors. Co-culture technology is used in cartilage tissue engineering to overcome obstacles related to the degeneration of seed cells, and shows promise for cartilage regeneration and repair. In this review, we focus first on existing co-culture systems for cartilage tissue engineering and related fields, and discuss the conditions and mechanisms thereof. This is followed by methods for optimizing seed cell co-culture conditions to generate functional neo-cartilage tissue, which will lead to a new era in cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immobilization as a result of long-term bed rest can lead to gradual bone loss. Due to their distribution throughout the bone matrix and remarkable interconnectivity, osteocytes represent the major mechanosensors in bone and translate mechanical into biochemical signals controlling bone remodeling. To test whether immobilization affects the characteristics of the osteocyte network in human cortical bone, femoral diaphyseal bone specimens were analyzed in immobilized female individuals and compared to age-matched postmenopausal individuals with primary osteoporosis. Premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy individuals served as control groups. Cortical porosity, osteocyte number and lacunar area, the frequency of hypermineralized lacunae as well as cortical bone calcium content (CaMean) were assessed using bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Bone matrix properties were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the immobilization group, cortical porosity was significantly higher, and qBEI revealed a trend towards higher matrix mineralization compared to osteoporotic individuals. Osteocyte density and canalicular density showed a declining rate from premenopausal towards healthy postmenopausal and osteoporotic individuals with peculiar reductions in the immobilization group, while the number of hypermineralized lacunae accumulated inversely. In conclusion, reduced osteocyte density and impaired connectivity during immobilization are associated with a specific bone loss pattern, reflecting a phenotype clearly distinguishable from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Immobilization periods may lead to a loss of survival signals for osteocytes, provoking bone loss that is even higher than in osteoporosis states, while osteocytic osteolysis remains absent.

AB  - Abstract Our studies have shown that treatment with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the CD11d subunit of the leukocyte integrin CD11d/CD18 after spinal cord injury (SCI) decreases intraspinal inflammation, myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration, improving neurological function in rats. Using severe clip compression SCI in the rat, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were employed to assess the effects of an anti-CD11d mAb treatment on spinal cord cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, formation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a marker of RNA and DNA oxidation) and protein carbonylation (a marker of protein oxidation). We also assessed treatment effects on the expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (redox effector factor-1, APE/Ref-1), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the base excision repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA. The expression of COX-2 and formation of 8-OHdG and protein carbonyl groups were increased after SCI while APE/Ref-1 expression was decreased. Anti-CD11d mAb treatment clearly attenuated COX-2 expression and 8-OHdG and protein carbonyl formation and rescued APE/Ref-1 expression after SCI. This study suggests that anti-CD11d mAb treatment significantly reduces intraspinal free radical formation after SCI, thereby reducing protein and DNA oxidative damage. These effects likely underlie tissue preservation and improved neurological function resulting from the mAb treatment.

AB  - Günter Grass's 2002 novella Im Krebsgang is just one piece of historical fiction in a long line of works that deal with German suffering in the context of the atrocities perpetrated by the Germans in the Second World War. This essay analyzes the relationship between the narrative's treatment of the victim-perpetrator binary together with the active-passive postures of its generationally connected characters. The article demonstrates that the story's main character and narrator, Paul Pokriefke, occupies a painful and conflicted stance in the middle of these dichotomies. John Peradotto's work on the Odyssey provides a fitting framework for this approach. He shows how the central figure of the Homeric epic is also caught in a middle voice existence signified by the potential dual translation of his name in the active and passive voices. In his family tale of trauma and disaster, Grass demonstrates Pokriefke's middle position not only generationally, politically and attitudinally, but also by presenting a narrator who cannot always find a place in his own syntax.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

AB  - ABSTRACT Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can adversely affect fine motor control of the hand. Precision pinch between the thumb and index finger requires coordinated movements of these digits for reliable task performance. We examined the impairment upon precision pinch function affected by CTS during digit movement and digit contact. Eleven CTS subjects and 11 able-bodied (ABL) controls donned markers for motion capture of the thumb and index finger during precision pinch movement (PPM). Subjects were instructed to repetitively execute the PPM task, and performance was assessed by range of movement, variability of the movement trajectory, and precision of digit contact. The CTS group demonstrated shorter path-length of digit endpoints and greater variability in inter-pad distance and most joint angles across the PPM movement. Subjects with CTS also showed lack of precision in contact points on the digit-pads and relative orientation of the digits at contact. Carpal tunnel syndrome impairs the ability to perform precision pinch across the movement and at digit-contact. The findings may serve to identify deficits in manual dexterity for functional evaluation of CTS. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

This article presents a composite case study undertaken within family therapy and children?s social work based around some high-risk CSE cases, using a variety of systemic ideas. The CSE case includes typical risks of abuse and exploitation, and the steps taken to understand and promote safety for the composite young person. The authors explore how CSE sits within the wider contexts of power and abuse in society. The article focuses particularly on first and second order change in CSE interventions, how we can systemically understand ?grooming?, and how the LUUUUTT model can aid our practice. Practitioner points It is essential to locate CSE in its wider contexts, including family, organisational and societal contexts It is essential to understand the traps involved in the grooming process in CSE The LUUUUTT model (stories Lived, Unknown, Untold, Unheard, Untellable, Told and storyTelling) can be helpful in guiding systemic conversations and disclosures by young people A more cohesive and coordinated multi-agency approach to CSE is proposed

AB  - This essay examines a subgenre of the Human Rights novel, the torture novel, devoted to the social ontology of the human. In the HR torture novel embodiment is rendered ?abject? and the subject ?unmade?, through dehumanization and debasement. The abject embodiment is the consequence of institutional precarity and collapsing social apparatuses. Tortured subjects acquire membership of a collective memory of pain, a trauma-memory citizenship, made possible through the articulation of memories of torture, bringing together fellow sufferers, former perpetrators and witnesses.The essay concludes that the torture novel is integral to the project of Human Rights because it demonstrates how broken bodies are produced in eroding social conditions, driven by state policy, state indifference or state oppression.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated the scale reliability, factor structure, and convergent validity of the Early Maladaptive Schema Questionnaire?Research Version (EMSQ-R), a 75-item self-report inventory that is a revised version of the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ) and that measures the presence and severity of 15 early maladaptive schemas (EMS), in an undergraduate sample of 292 participants. Eleven EMS scales were found to have adequate reliability, and 14 hypothesized EMS factors emerged during factor analysis. In addition, findings provided support for the underlying tenets of Schema Therapy (ST), by demonstrating correlations between EMS and measures of both adult attachment and childhood trauma. Future clinical and research directions are discussed.?Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic wounds often result from prolonged inflammation involving excessive polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity. Studies show that the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in fish oils generate bioactive lipid mediators that reduce inflammation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment in numerous inflammatory disease models. This study's purpose was to test the hypotheses that boosting plasma levels of EPA and DHA with oral supplementation would alter lipid mediator levels in acute wound microenvironments and reduce polymorphonuclear leukocyte levels. Eighteen individuals were randomized to 28 days of either EPA+DHA supplementation (Active Group) or placebo. After 28 days, the Active Group had significantly higher plasma levels of EPA (p<0.001) and DHA (p<0.001) than the Placebo Group and significantly lower wound fluid levels of two 15-lipoxygenase products of ?-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [p=0.033] and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid [p=0.006]), at 24 hours postwounding. The Active Group also had lower mean levels of myeloperoxidase, a leukocyte marker, at 12 hours and significantly more reepithelialization on Day 5 postwounding. We suggest that lipid mediator profiles can be manipulated by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid intake to create a wound microenvironment more conducive to healing.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.
