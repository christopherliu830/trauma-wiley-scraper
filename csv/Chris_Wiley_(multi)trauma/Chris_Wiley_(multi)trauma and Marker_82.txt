AB  - Abstract Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CN) is one of the most challenging foot complications in diabetes. Common predisposing and precipitating factors include neuropathy and increased mechanical forces, fracture and bone resorption, trauma and inflammation. In the last 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the early recognition of the acute Charcot foot when the X ray is still negative (stage 0 or incipient Charcot foot). Recent advances in imaging modalities have enabled the detection of initial signs of inflammation and underlying bone damage before overt bone and joint destruction has occurred. Casting therapy remains the mainstay of medical therapy of acute CN. If timely instituted, offloading can arrest disease activity and prevent foot deformity. In cases with severe deformity, modern surgical techniques can correct the unstable deformity for improved functional outcome and limb survival. Emerging new studies into the cellular mechanisms of severe bone destruction have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms of pathological bone and joint destruction in CN. It is hoped that these studies may provide a scientific basis for new interventions with biological agents. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Child maltreatment is a worldwide phenomenon that is still often under-recognised. This Chapter primarily covers physical and emotional maltreatment, and neglect; sexual abuse is specifically addressed in a separate chapter. Such abuse experiences are usually associated with marked distress, impairments in mental health, social and academic functioning. There are also physical changes including alterations in brain structure and an impact of chronic stress on inflammatory responses associated with physical health impairments. Awareness of such physical effects further adds to the importance of prompt recognition of maltreatment, effective treatment of its sequelae, and above all primary prevention. There are modest but encouraging findings emerging at each of these levels of intervention.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors ?? Shi S, Bartold PM, Miura M, Seo BM, Robey PG, Gronthos S Objectives ?? Identification, characterization, and potential application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human dental tissues. Methods ?? Dental pulp and periodontal ligament were obtained from normal human impacted third molars. The tissues were digested in collagenase/dispase to generate single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2?mM l-glutamine, 100??M l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting were employed to characterize the phenotype of freshly isolated and ex vivo expanded cell populations. The developmental potential of cultured cells was assessed following co-transplantation with hydroxyapetite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) particles into immunocompromised mice for 8?weeks. Results ?? MSC were identified in adult human dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells, DPSC), human primary teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, SHED), and periodontal ligament (periodontal ligament stem cells, PDLSC) by their capacity to generate clongenic cell clusters in culture. Ex vivo expanded DPSC, SHED, and PDLSC populations expressed a heterogeneous assortment of makers associated with MSC, dentin, bone, smooth muscle, neural tissue, and endothelium. PDLSC were also found to express the tendon specific marker, Scleraxis. Xenogeneic transplants containing HA/TCP with either DPSC or SHED generated donor-derived dentin-pulp-like tissues with distinct odontoblast layers lining the mineralized dentin-matrix. In parallel studies, PDLSC generated cementum-like structures associated with PDL-like connective tissue when transplanted with HA/TCP into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion ?? Collectively, these data revealed the presence of distinct MSC populations associated with dental structures with the potential of stem cells to regenerate living human dental tissues in vivo.

AB  - Four action researchers present a case study of a project conducted by members of a national family therapy organization and members of a local family therapy institute, which describes their efforts to collaborate with local disaster recovery workers 2 years after Hurricane Katrina. The aim of the collaboration was to create a local action research team to study best practices that strengthen resilience after disaster. The authors discuss choice points and dilemmas faced in finding collaborative partners and in clarifying what constitutes an invitation to work in a community. The case study illuminates tensions and understandings between outsiders and a community still facing the long-term effects of a disaster.

AB  - Abstract The development and organisation of the human brain start in the embryonic stage and is a highly complex orchestrated process. It depends on series of cellular mechanisms that are precisely regulated by multiple proteins, signalling pathways and non-protein-coding genes. A crucial process during cerebral cortex development is the migration of nascent neuronal cells to their appropriate positions and their associated differentiation into layer-specific neurons. Neuronal migration defects (NMD) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders including monogenetic disorders and residual syndromes due to damaging factors during prenatal development like infections, maternal diabetes mellitus or phenylketonuria, trauma, and drug use. Multifactorial causes are also possible. Classification into lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and neuronal heterotopia is based on the visible morphologic cortex anomalies. Characteristic clinical features of NMDs are severe psychomotor developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, and dysmorphisms. Neurometabolic disorders only form a small subgroup within the large group of NMDs. The prototypes are peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, peroxisomal ß-oxidation defects and congenital disorders of O-glycosylation. The rapid evolution of biotechnology has resulted in an ongoing identification of metabolic and non-metabolic disease genes for NMDs. Nevertheless, we are far away from understanding the specific role of cortical genes and metabolites on spatial and temporal regulation of human cortex development and associated malformations. This limited understanding of the pathogenesis hinders the attempt for therapeutic approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of the most important cortical malformations and potential underlying neurometabolic disorders.

AB  - Plants from the Verbenaceae family may cause contact dermatitis of unknown nature. This report describes 2 cases of allergic reactions to the Verbena species. A teenage boy developed an anaphylactic allergic response following contact with the leaves of Verbena hybrida. Characterization of the patient's specific IgE response to Verbena hybrida, using Western blots and autoradiography, identified the specific 62000 Dalton allergen present in the verbena leaves to which the patient reacted. This is the first report of an IgE- mediated immediate contact hypersensitivity reaction to Verbena hybrida a common perennial in South African gardens. The other case was a 23-year-old female gardener who developed immediate and delayed- type contact dermatitis from Verbena elegans?Cleopatra? produced in a Danish nursery. Prick tests to plant material were considered positive and of an allergic nature.

AB  - This position paper proposes a modeling pipeline to develop clinically relevant neuromusculoskeletal models to understand and treat complex neurological disorders. Although applicable to a variety of neurological conditions, we provide direct pipeline applicative examples in the context of cerebral palsy (CP). This paper highlights technologies in: (1) patient-specific segmental rigid body models developed from magnetic resonance imaging for use in inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics pipelines; (2) efficient population-based approaches to derive skeletal models and muscle origins/insertions that are useful for population statistics and consistent creation of continuum models; (3) continuum muscle descriptions to account for complex muscle architecture including spatially varying material properties with muscle wrapping; (4) muscle and tendon properties specific to CP; and (5) neural-based electromyography-informed methods for muscle force prediction. This represents a novel modeling pipeline that couples for the first time electromyography extracted features of disrupted neuromuscular behavior with advanced numerical methods for modeling CP-specific musculoskeletal morphology and function. The translation of such pipeline to the clinical level will provide a new class of biomarkers that objectively describe the neuromusculoskeletal determinants of pathological locomotion and complement current clinical assessment techniques, which often rely on subjective judgment.

AB  - Abstract Elevated intraocular pressure may lead to retinal ganglion cell injury and consequent visual deficits. Chronic intraocular pressure increase is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a leading blinding disease, and permanent visual deficits can also occur following acute pressure increments due to trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery. How pressure affects retinal neurons is not firmly established. Mechanical damage at the optic nerve head, reduced blood supply, inflammation and cytotoxic factors have all been called into play. Reasoning that the analysis of retinal neurons soon after pressure elevation would provide useful cues, we imaged individual ganglion cells in isolated rat retinas before and after short hydrostatic pressure increments. We found that slowly rising pressure to peaks observed in trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery (50?90?mmHg) did not damage ganglion cells, whereas a rapid 1?min pulse to 50?mmHg injured 30% of these cells within 1?h. The severity of damage and the number of affected cells increased with stronger or repeated insults. Degrading extracellular ATP or blocking the P2X receptors for ATP prevented acute pressure-induced damage in ganglion cells. Similar effects were observed in?vivo. A short intraocular pressure transient increased extracellular ATP levels in the eye fluids and damaged ganglion cells within 1?h. Reducing extracellular ATP in the eye prevented damage to ganglion cells and accelerated recovery of their response to light. These data show that rapid pressure transients induce acute ganglion cell injury and unveil the causal role of extracellular ATP elevation in such injury.

AB  - Abstract Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) and PCL-R psychopathy are critically examined regarding their application to sentencing determinations. PCL-R psychopathy is emerging in the literature as a more useful forensic diagnostic construct than APD, which appears flawed by multiple weaknesses. These include shifting diagnostic criteria, innumeracy problems, absence of symptom weighting, temporal instability, and the equivalence of some symptoms with substance abuse disorders. Additionally, APD overdiagnosis may result from inattention to issues of social context, trauma history, and symptom pervasiveness. Neither objective nor projective personality testing reliably differentiates APD. Finally, an APD diagnosis does not always indicate criminal, much less incorrigible criminal behavior. By contrast, PCL-R psychopathy results are strongly predictive of criminal behavior and violent recidivism for Caucasian males through mid-life residing in the community. Emerging research with the PCL-R regarding other important populations and contexts is promising but generalization is currently limited. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Assessment of nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula commonly relies on the determination of CSF markers in an aqueous rhinorrhea, such as the ?2-transferrin immunofixation assay. While generally reliable, false positive and false negative results have been reported for most of the laboratory tests yet available. Based on the hypothesis that the simultaneous assessment of several CSF markers may yield an increased sensitivity and specificity, we used a proteomics, two-dimensional electrophoresis 2-DE based approach to study samples of nasal secretions obtained from 18 patients suspected of CSF rhinorrhea. Since CSF, nasal mucus and plasma may coexist in the nasal cavities, we first defined five specific markers for each of these biological fluids (transferrin, prostaglandin-D synthase, transthyretin, and two unknown trains of spots for CSF, immunoglobulin A (IgA) S-chain, lipocortin-1, lipocalin-1, prolactine-inducible protein and palatal lung nasal epithelium clone protein for mucus, haptoglobin α1/2- and ?-chains, fibrinogen α-, ?- and ?-chains for plasma). Gels from the rhinorrhea patients were then compared to these 2-DE reference maps to determine the presence or absence of the defined markers, and clinical data were independently compared to the results of the 2-DE study. In all cases, the biological fluid(s) anticipated to be present in the nasal secretions based on clinical data were correctly identified by 2-DE. Moreover, an excellent correlation was found in nine patients who underwent extensive workup for suspected CSF rhinorrhea, since CSF was found by the 2-DE method in four patients in whom a CSF fistula was confirmed, whereas the test was negative in five patients in whom a CSF fistula was excluded. In the remaining patients, mucus, sometimes contamined with blood, was found to be the major component of the nasal secretions, confirming that clear mucus may mimick CSF rhinorrhea. These preliminary results suggest that a 2-DE-based multimarker approach is a valid, sensitive, and specific method to assess the presence of CSF in occult rhinorrhea.

AB  - Abstract The impact of work related stressors on emergency clinicians has long been recognized, yet there is little formal research into the benefits of debriefing hospital staff after critical incidents, such as failed resuscitation. This article examines current models of debriefing and their application to emergency staff through a review of the literature. The goal being, to outline best practice, with recommendations for guideline development and future research directives. An electronic database search was a conducted in Ovid and Psychinfo. All available abstracts were read and a hand search was completed of the references. Included articles were selected by a panel of two experts. Models and evidence relating to their efficacy were identified from the literature, and detailed evaluation included. The reviewed literature revealed a distinct paucity regarding the efficacy of debriefing of clinicians post CI and in particular randomized controlled trials. Despite this debriefing is perceived as important by emergency clinicians. However evidence presents both benefits and disadvantages to debriefing interventions. In the absence of evidence based practice guidelines, any development of models of debriefing in the emergency healthcare setting should be closely evaluated. And future research directives should aim towards large randomized control trials.

AB  - QRST-angle and Sudden Cardiac Death Introduction Improvements in risk stratification for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will require discovery of markers that extend beyond the LV ejection fraction (LVEF). The frontal QRS-T angle has been shown to predict risk of SCA but the value of this marker independent of the LVEF has not been investigated. Methods and Results Cases of adult SCA with an archived electrocardiogram (12-lead ECG) available before the event, with a computable frontal QRS-T angle, were identified from the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) ongoing in the Portland, Oregon metro area. A total of 666 SCA cases (mean age 67.2 years; 95% CI, 52.3?82.1 years; 68.6% males) were compared to 863 controls (mean age 66.6 years, 55.2?78.0 years; 68.1% males; 75.0% had CAD) from the same geographical region. The mean frontal QRS-T angle was wider in cases (74o; 95% CI, 17o?131o) compared to controls (51o; 95% CI, 5o?97o; P< 0.0001). A frontal QRS-T angle of more than 90o remained associated with increased risk of SCD after adjusting for age, gender, heart rate, prolonged intraventricular conduction, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG LVH), baseline comorbidities, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.60?3.09; P< 0.0001). Conclusion A wide QRS-T angle greater than 90o is associated with an increased risk of SCA independent of the left ventricular ejection fraction.
