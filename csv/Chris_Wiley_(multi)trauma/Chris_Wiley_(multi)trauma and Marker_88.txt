AB  - Summary 1. ?Effective and sustainable natural resource management is enhanced when the consequences of exploitative practices are fully understood and acknowledged. Commercial fisheries devote considerable resources to maximize the harvest of target species and minimize interference with non-target stocks. Appropriately, bycatch and discard of non-target stocks are recognized as critical economic and conservation concerns. Few studies, however, have examined non-retention mortality in target stocks. Non-retention, where fish are engaged by fishing gear but not landed, is rarely quantified and the effects on stocks are unknown. Mortality due to non-retention may have important effects on the dynamics of exploited populations. 2. ?We surveyed spawning populations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka that had traversed commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to estimate the incidence of non-retention in gillnets and the severity of injuries associated with entanglement. To better understand how gillnet injury affects spawning success, we tagged and monitored stream-spawning fish and applied a maximum likelihood model to mark?recapture data. 3. ?A substantial portion (11?29%) of spawning sockeye salmon exhibited clear signs of past entanglement with commercial gillnets. Survival among such fish was significantly reduced. More than half of the fish that reach natal spawning grounds with fishery-related injuries fail to reproduce. This suggests that estimates of spawning stocks are inflated by 5?15% at minimum. 4. ?Synthesis and applications. Our analyses indicate that non-retention in gillnet fisheries is an important and under-appreciated consequence of the exploitation of salmon. Stock estimates for exploited populations that do not account for non-retention mortality overestimate the number of reproductively viable fish. Unaccounted mortality and interannual variation in the magnitude of this mortality may prevent accurate estimates of viable spawners, confound our understanding of the relationship between stock size and recruitment, impede optimal management and obscure the ecosystem impacts of migratory stocks in coastal watersheds. Given the magnitude of non-retention in this fishery, explicit consideration of non-retention mortality may be warranted across a wide range of exploited populations.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Objective To describe a reverse axial pattern flap based on the superficial branch of the dorsal penile artery and describe its use in preputial reconstruction. Materials and Methods Ten penises were harvested from canine cadavers; five were used to describe the dermatome supplied by the superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis and five to show perfusion of the skin flap. The superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis was identified fluoroscopically by injecting contrast material into the dorsal artery of the penis. This artery was then catheterised and injected with methylene blue to identify the perfused area. A skin flap was created by making a full thickness skin incision at the level of the fornix, along the circumference of the penis. The flap was developed by pulling the cut end toward the tip of the penis while undermining the skin. The flap was considered long enough when the cut end of the flap reached the level of the urethral opening. We also describe a case of preputial resection and reconstruction using this flap. Results Injection of methylene blue demonstrated the arterial supply to the skin flap. This flap was successful in treating the clinical case following resection of a mast cell tumour on the prepuce, although a small area of full thickness flap necrosis, which healed by second intention, developed postoperatively. Clinical Importance This technique may be useful for single step preputial reconstruction.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper reports an investigation into the accuracy and effectiveness of two (2) senior Australian radiographers in the reporting of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs in the adult trauma situation. and discusses the international debate on radiographer role extension into plain film reporting. The study of 540 patients referred to a large metropolitan emergency imaging department demonstrated high rates of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity = 98.00% specificity = 99.11%) in the assessment of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs. 294 out of 300 positive examinations were identified correctly (FPR=0.88%) as were 225 out of 227 negative or normal examinations (FNR=2.00%). A discussion on relevant statistical measures and their definitions is outlined. In the study radiologist reports are used as the comparative gold standard. The findings demonstrate an ability of clinically experienced radiographers to accurately and effectively provide diagnostic opinions on musculoskeletal radiographs. A formalised approach to radiographer reporting can be justified and a formal program to train appropriately experienced radiographers is recommended.

AB  - Abstract This cross-sectional study explored age-related differences in the frequency of diagnosis of personality disorder (PD) among 790 veterans admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit across three age groups: 20?39, 40?59, and 60+. Older adults obtained a lower frequency (55.4%) of PD diagnosis than middle-aged adults (69.0%), who in turn obtained a lower frequency of PD diagnosis than young adults (75.9%). Older adults and middle-aged adults were less likely to receive a diagnosis of Borderline PD than young adults. Older adults were also less likely to receive a diagnosis of Mixed PD than young adults, but received significantly more diagnoses of Narcissistic PD than young adults. Patients diagnosed with PD had higher rates of psychiatric hospitalization than those with no diagnosis of PD. Older adults and middle-aged adults with PD had significantly fewer psychiatric hospitalizations than young adults with PD, whereas there were no age-related differences in the frequency of medical hospitalizations. These findings are consistent with research suggesting an overall softening of PD features with age, particularly those characteristic of the ?dramatic-erratic?, Cluster B types.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Complex composite defects of the oral cavity are often created due to en bloc resection of malignant tumors. These defects can involve bone, soft tissue, oral mucosa, and external skin, posing a reconstructive challenge to the microvascular surgeon. Though advances have been made in free tissue transfer via piggybacking techniques and double free-flaps, increases in operative time and morbidity remain limiting factors. Likewise, advancements in single composite flaps (e.g., double-skin paddle fibular free-flap) allow for a single donor site, but limit workable tissue. This report describes our experience with the scapular, parascapular, and latissimus dorsi (SPLD) as a combined single unit osteomyocutaneous flap for composite reconstruction of complex oral defects. A case example is subsequently reviewed for clinical correlation. This is an operative techniques article describing the use of the SPLD single multi-tissue flap for repair of complex oral defects. Cadaveric dissection was performed for instructional purposes. Case example was given for clinical correlation. Relevant history, anatomy, procedural details, and possible complications are presented and subsequently correlated to the case example. A SPLD free-flap as a single multi-tissue flap is a viable and beneficial option for reconstruction of complex oral defects. It provides the volume of tissue necessary to fill composite defects and exists as an alternative to multi-flap procedures, which carry a longer operative time and multiple donor site morbidity.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Circulating histones are a newly recognized mediator implicated in various inflammatory diseases. It is likely that the release of histones, from dying hepatocytes or inflammatory leukocytes, into the circulation initiates and amplifies inflammation during the course of acute liver failure (ALF). In this study, we investigated a putative pathogenic role of circulating histones in a murine model of ALF induced by D-galactosamine (GalN) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hepatic function and histological indexes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, hepatocyte apoptosis and the levels of circulating histone were measured in GalN/LPS-treated mice. GalN/LPS caused severe liver damage and a notable increase in plasma concentration of circulating histones. To further assess the role of circulating histones in our model, we administered exogenous histones and anti-histone H4 antibody. Notably, exogenous histones aggravated GalN/LPS-induced hepatotoxicity, whereas anti-histone antibody significantly protected mice. Circulating histones may serve as both a functional marker of ALF activity and as an inflammatory mediator contributing to the progression of ALF. Blockade of circulating histones shows potent protective effects, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for ALF. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 2384?2391, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy might be an effective approach for the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, many unanswered questions remain before clinical translation, such as the most effective stem cell type, a reliable transplantation method, including the carrier choice, and the fate of stem cells after misdirected delivery, among others. The objective of the study was to evaluate the fate and effect of allogenic bone marrow MSCs after transplantation into an IDD model. The L2?3, L3?4 and L4?5 intervertebral discs (IVDs) of four rabbits were stabbed to create IDD. Rabbit MSCs were expanded in vitro and in part transduced with retrovirus/eGFP. After 3 weeks, 1 ? 105 MSCs were injected into the IVDs. The rabbits were followed by X-ray and MRI 3 and 9 weeks after injection. Then the animals were sacrificed and the spines analysed histologically. MRI showed no signs of regeneration. X-ray and gross anatomy inspection demonstrated large anterolateral osteophytes. Histological analysis showed that the osteophytes were composed of mineralized tissue surrounded by chondrocytes, with the labelled MSCs among the osteophyte-forming cells. The labelled MSCs were not found in the nucleus. Inflammatory cells were not observed in any injected IVDs. These results raise concern that MSCs can migrate out of the nucleus and undesirable bone formation may occur. While cause cannot be inferred from this study, the presence of MSCs in the osteophytes suggests a potential side-effect with this approach. IVD regeneration strategies need to focus on cell carrier systems and annulus-sealing technologies to avoid pitfalls. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective This study sought to assess the long-term clinical benefits and predictors of survival of trans-catheter aortic valve closure in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients. Background LVADs have been shown to increase survival and quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, severe aortic insufficiency (AI) can develop in up to 50% of patients at 12 months resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Trans-catheter treatment of LVAD associated AI has emerged as a potential alternative to surgical treatment. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure using an Amplatzer Multi-Fenestrated Septal Occluder ?Cribriform? device to assess potential clinical and procedural factors associated with survival. Student's t-tests were used to compare baseline patient demographics and procedural characteristics, as well as patient outcomes immediately post procedure and at 6 months. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 10 patients (70% male, median age 59 years) were included. Technical success was accomplished in 100% of patients with a 6 month survival rate of 30% (3/10). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had a higher rate of pre-procedural clinical co-morbidities, an increased likelihood of right ventricular failure, and received larger occluder devices. Conclusions Trans-catheter aortic valve closure successfully treats late severe AI in LVAD patients, however, the presence or development of right heart failure portends a worse prognosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the factors involved in the development of right ventricular failure, and potential treatment, in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Löfgren's syndrome is an acute-onset presentation of sarcoidosis that can be easily missed in an ED setting. A case is reported of Löfgren's syndrome presenting as erythema nodosum with bilateral ankle oedema. Although rare, this diagnosis should be considered when examining a patient with erythema nodosum and articular symptoms.
