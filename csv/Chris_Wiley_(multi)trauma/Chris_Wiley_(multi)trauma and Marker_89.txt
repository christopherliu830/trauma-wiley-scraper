AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Conservation of resources (COR) theory was originally introduced as a framework for understanding and predicting the consequences of major and traumatic stress, but following the work of Hobfoll and Shirom (1993), COR theory has been adopted to understanding and predicting work-related stress and both the stress and resilience that occur within work settings and work culture. COR theory underscores the critical role of resource possession, lack, loss and gain and depicts personal, social and material resources co-travelling in resource caravans, rather than piecemeal. We briefly review the principles of COR theory and integrate it in the crossover model, which provides a key mechanism for multi-person exchange of emotions, experiences and resources. Understanding the impact of resource reservoirs, resource passageways and crossover provides a framework for research and intervention promoting resilience to employees as well as to organizations. It emphasizes that the creation and maintenance of resource caravan passageways promote resource gain climates through resource crossover processes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Intravenous clodronate in the treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. (Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini, Milan, Italy) J Rheumatol 2000;27:1477?1483. This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and assessed the urinary excretion of type 1 collagen crosslinked N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after treatment. Thirty-two patients with RSDS were randomized to receive either IV Clodronate 300 mg daily for 10 consecutive days or placebo. Forty days later, the placebo treated patients received the clodronate treatment. Outcome measures included as a primary endpoint the visual analog scale of pain (VAS, range 0?100); secondary endpoints were a clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3) and an efficacy verbal score (EVS, range 0?3). Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before the treatment, 40 (T40), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) days later. At T40 the 15 patients randomized to clodronate treatment showed significant decreases of VAS and CGA (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). Compared with the placebo group (17 patients), significant differences were found in all clinical variables. A further clinical improvement was observed throughout the study. Pooling the results of all 32 patients after clodronate treatment, at T180 the overall percentage decrease of VAS was 9.32 ± 15.6% with 30 patients significantly improved or asymptomatic. Significant inverse correlations between baseline NTx values and decreases of VAS were found at T90 (P = 0.03) and T180 (P = 0.01). No adverse events related to treatment occurred. Conclude that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and effective in the treatment of RSDS. NTx seems to be a predictive factor for clodronate efficacy. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized double blind placbo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) or complex regional pain syndrome type I. It is also to assess the urinary excretion of type I collogen crosslink N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after the treatment. Thirty-two patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I were randomized to receive either a placebo or IV clodronate 300mg daily for 10 consecutive days. At the end of 40 days, the placebo group was then treated with the clodronate. The primary endpoint measures with the visual analog scale (VAS, range 0?100) and a secondary endpoint was the clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3), and an efficacy vocal score (EVS, range 0?3). In addition, the patient had clinical and biochemical assessments performed before the treatment at 40 days, at 90 days, and at 180 days later. The purpose of the study was valued at the efficacy of the IV clodronate in pain relief. The second purpose was to evaluate the possibility of using NTx as a predicting factor for evaluating complex regional pain syndrome type I or the clodranate efficacy. On day 40, 15 patients that were randomized to the clodronate treatment showed significant decreases in their VAS and CGA when compared with the placebo group with 17 patients. In addition, the patients who had originally received placebo infusions showed decreased VAS and CGA scores after 40 days of treatment with the clodronate when compared to their VAS and CGA scores after placebo. At 180 days, the patients continued to show significant improvement or were asymptomatic. Bisphosphonates have been proposed since 1988 for the treatment of CRPS type I. The most frequently used is pamidronate, which is given intravenously showing varied results. The pamidronate did not seem to be well tolerated. Alendronate is also given intravenously demonstrating good efficacy. It, however, has a high relapse rate. Clodronate was chosen for this study because it was efficacious in treatment of various painful skeletal disorders and was more tolerable and safe than the pamidronate. The length of the time of the study was chosen to be 10 consecutive days so that it followed the study with successful use of pamidronate. These results suggest that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and is an effective complex regional pain syndrome type I treatment that may induce prompt and long lasting improvement. This study also attempted to demonstrate NTx as a predictive factor for clodranate efficacy. While NTx has shown to be a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption, in this study, they found a low association between high NTx values and the complex regional pain syndrome type I. This finding could weaken the relationship between NTx baseline values and the responsiveness to clodronate treatment. It should be noted, however, that there were significant immerse correlations found between the baseline NTx values and in the pain improvement measured on the percentage change of VAS at 90 days and 180 days. Therefore, while significant inverse correlations may have been determined, and the NTx may be a promising tool, it is not yet possible to determine the predictive rolls of NTx as a marker.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common sports-related knee injuries that increase the risk of developing post-traumatic osteoarthritis. ACL tears are rarely an isolated injury but are often associated with traumatic bone marrow lesions (BMLs). While early loss of bone mass following the ACL injury has been previously described, to date, microarchitectural information has not been reported due to the limited resolution of clinical imaging systems. In this study, we provide the first evidence of detailed bone mass and microarchitectural changes in the first 10 months following an acute ACL tear, and localized to traumatic BMLs. Fifteen participants with an acute unilateral ACL tear were assessed at four-time points using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and traumatic BMLs were identified with magnetic resonance imaging. Loss of bone mass was localized to the injured knee (?4.6% to ?15.8%, depending on bone and depth) and was accelerated immediately following the injury before suggesting a recovery phase. This loss of bone was accelerated even greater in traumatic BMLs (?18.2% to ?20.6%, depending on bone). Bone loss was accompanied by microstructural degeneration of trabecular bone. For example, in the lateral femur of the injured knee, the subchondral bone plate decreased in thickness (?9.0%). This study confirmed loss of bone mass in the months following ACL tears and described the underlying bone microstructural changes. The presented bone changes were accelerated in regions of traumatic BMLs. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 37:2325?2336, 2019

AB  - Background? For families of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) getting a diagnosis is a traumatic experience on which future care and education plans for the child depend. In this paper parental experiences of diagnosis and forward planning for children with ASD are reported. Method? This paper is part of a large cross-sectional study conducted in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that assessed the needs and experiences of parents of children diagnosed with ASD. Questionnaires were designed and completed by 95 parents, reporting on 100 children, as well as 67 multi-disciplinary professionals. Results? Findings confirm that diagnostic and planning processes are extremely stressful for parents, that statutory diagnosis takes a long time, that care and education plans do not include full parental participation, and that reviews of plans do not consistently include intervention data. Conclusion? Policy and practice implications of these findings are important for future revisions of diagnostic tools and manuals.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To find out if the severity of acute pancreatitis or the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis influences HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Design: Prospective open study. Setting: University hospital, Austria. Subjects: 9 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis in need of operative treatment, 5 patients with mild acute pancreatitis, and 7 healthy volunteers. Interventions: Samples of 5 ml blood were taken daily into endotoxin free tubes at same time points. Surgical treatment for severe acute pancreatitis consisted of blunt necrosectomy, operative lavage, laparostomy, and open drainage. Main outcome measures: Correlation between HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes on the one hand and the severity of acute pancreatitis and operative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis, on the other. Results: In patients with severe acute pancreatitis expression of HLA-DR and CD14 was significantly downregulated both before and after operation (p < 0.0001; ANOVA), compared with patients with mild acute pancreatitis or healthy controls. However the expression of the two cell surface markers was not affected either by the first operation, or by the reoperations. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in acute pancreatitis the expression of cell surface markers on peripheral blood monocytes is related to the severity of disease but is not influenced by operative treatment.

AB  - Abstract To enable dynamic regulation of muscle mass and myofiber repair following injury, a satellite cell precursor population exists to supply additional nuclei. Activated satellite cells express many genes and associated proteins necessary for maturation and incorporation into the damaged fiber. There is little knowledge about the response of these markers following whole-body resistance exercise training. We investigated the impact of 12 weeks of progressive whole-body resistance training on the expression of MRFs, PAX7, NCAM, and FA1, incorporating both acute and chronic resistance exercise components. Ten young recreationally active males (21.2 ± 3.5 years) performed 12 weeks of whole-body resistance training at 70?85% of their predetermined one-repetition maximum (1RM). At the initiation and completion of the training period, muscular strength was assessed by RM and dynamometer testing, and vastus lateralis samples were obtained prior to and 3 h following an acute resistance exercise test (both whole-body and isometric exercises). Increased mRNA expression of PAX7 (threefold), NCAM (threefold), MYF5 (threefold), MYOD (threefold) and MYOGENIN (twofold) was observed 3 h after the acute resistance exercise test, both pre and posttraining. Similarly, PAX7 (11-fold) and FA1 (twofold) protein abundance increased after acute exercise, while resting NCAM (eightfold) and FA1 (threefold) protein abundance increased following 12 weeks of resistance training. It is possible that these molecular changes are primarily due to the preceding exercise bout, and are not modified by long-term or whole-body exercise training.

AB  - Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.?Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

AB  - Aim We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of multilevel surgery (MLS) in ambulatory children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Method Two hundred and thirty-one children were evaluated at short term (1.1y, SD 0.4) and long term (9.1y, SD 3.0) follow-up using clinical examination and gait analysis. MLS was investigated by studying changes in the Gait Profile Score (GPS) referenced to the minimally important clinical difference. Results Ambulatory children aged 10 years and 7 months (SD 2y 11mo) at MLS in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I (19), II (144), and III (68) showed a decrease (improvement) in preoperative GPS from 16.3° (SD 4.8) to 11.3° (SD 3.2) at short-term follow-up, an improvement of 5°. At long-term follow-up, GPS was maintained at 11.4° (SD 3.1). Overall, 177 (76.6%) children maintained their improvement in GPS after 9 years. Interpretation Multilevel surgery is a safe and effective surgical intervention, which leads to a significant improvement in gait kinematics in children with bilateral spastic CP. This study improves our understanding of MLS in the long term and will help to inform families and children when planning for MLS. What this paper adds Largest study of multilevel surgery (MLS) for children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy, with longest follow-up. MLS resulted in significant long-term improvements in gait function. Minor adverse events were common, while events requiring intervention were uncommon (4% of children). Thirty-nine per cent of children required additional surgery during follow-up. ?Single-event multilevel surgery? was changed to the more realistic term ?multilevel surgery?.

AB  - Abstract Objective The provision of ?adequate analgesia? (which reduces the pain score by ≥2 and to <4 [0?10 scale]) is significantly associated with high levels of satisfaction with pain management among adult patients. We aimed to determine the variables (including ?adequate analgesia?) associated with parent satisfaction with their child's pain management. Methods We undertook an observational, pilot study in a mixed, metropolitan ED. Patients aged 4?16 years with a triage pain score of ≥4 were enrolled. Data included demographics, presenting complaint, pain scores every 30 min, analgesia administered, time to first analgesia, provision of nurse-initiated analgesia (NIA), and ?adequate analgesia?, and parent satisfaction 48-h post-discharge (6 point scale: very unsatisfied ? very satisfied). Results Complete data were collected on 185 patients: mean (SD) age 10.4 (3.6)?years, weight 41.9 (17.8)?kg; 93 (50.3%) were male. One hundred and ten (59.4%) parents were very satisfied with their child's pain management. Children of very satisfied parents had shorter times to analgesia than those who did not (median [interquartile range] 14 (33) vs 33 (46) min, respectively, P?=?0.003). Parents whose children received NIA or ?adequate analgesia? were more often very satisfied than those whose children did not. However, the differences were not significant (difference in proportions: 13.2% [95% CI ?1.9, 28.3], P?=?0.07 and 10.2% [95% CI ?5.02, 25.34], P?=?0.16, respectively). Conclusion Short times to analgesia are associated with parent satisfaction. There were non-significant trends towards high levels of satisfaction following the provision of NIA and ?adequate analgesia?. These findings will inform a well-powered study to confirm this association.

AB  - ABSTRACT The murine dorsum dermal excisional wound model has been widely utilized with or without splint application. However, variations in experimental methods create challenges for direct comparison of results provided in the literature and for design of new wound healing studies. Here, we investigated the effects of wound location and size, number of wounds, type of adhesive used for splint fixation on wound healing using splinted or unsplinted dorsum excisional full thickness wound models. One or two 6- or 8-mm full thickness wounds were made with or without splinting in genetically diabetic but heterozygous mice (Dock7m?+?/?+?Leprdb). Two different adhesives: tissue adhesive and an over the counter cyanoacrylate adhesive (OTCA) ?Krazy glue? were used to fix splints. Wound contraction, wound closure, and histopathological parameters including reepithelialization, collagen deposition and inflammation were compared between groups. No significant effect of wound number (1 vs. 2), side (left vs. right and cranial vs. caudal) or size on wound healing was observed. The OTCA group had a significantly higher splint success compared to the tissue adhesive group that resulted in significantly higher reepithelialization and collagen deposition in the OTCA group. Understanding the outcomes and effects of the variables will help investigators choose appropriate experimental conditions for the study purpose and interpret data.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

AB  - Abstract Mitchell (2004) and Robinson (2004) have expressed concerns regarding our recent article on debriefing (Devilly & Cotton, 2003). In this article we respond to their concerns, some scientific, some sociopolitical, and provide further substantiation regarding our conclusions. We conclude that CISD and CISM are indistinct approaches to trauma and should be treated as synonymous terms (CISD/M) until the necessary and sufficient elements of each are fully declared. Furthermore, based upon current evidence, we restipulate that CISD/M is an ineffective response to critical incidents for individuals, and that organisations need to revise their critical incident response policies to reflect the current weight of scientific evidence. There are currently no reliable studies demonstrating the efficacy of group debriefing.

AB  - Abstract This paper studies the impact of multi-layered transport exclusion on the mobility and accessibility of Palestinian women in Jerusalem. Ethnic segregation, hostile social climate, poor infrastructure and low levels of public transportation create multifaceted barriers to daily travel throughout the city. This research sheds light on the individual needs and decisions of women in making their travel choices in an exclusionary urban environment. This research is based on eight in-depth interviews and 38 participants in focus-group of Palestinian women living in East Jerusalem. It examines their public transport and private car use, in light of physical and psychological barriers. Interviews find that cultural and social pressures and the sense of exclusion and fear pose significant limitations to public transport use and destination choice, alongside poor infrastructure, low service levels and discriminatory planning policies. Many women internalize expectations of violence and exclusionary linguistic and visual cues, which serve as fear-based barriers for public transport use. Women's responses fall into a number of categories: avoiding West Jerusalem and minimizing travel; adopting private cars as safer and more practical or, at times, accepting and barrelling through fears. Policy implications include both immediate changes to symbology and behaviour of transport personnel, and long term implications about consciously-inclusive route and infrastructure planning.
