AB  - Background To date there are no biomarkers with proven reliability as a measure of disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of our study is to assess the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a measure of disease activity and progression in ALS. Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ALS, 25 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and 21 with other neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated. CSF NFL levels were assayed by two-site solid-phase sandwich ELISA. In patients with ALS, neurological status was assessed by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) and the Medical Research Council scale, and the progression of the disease was evaluated using the ?diagnostic delay? and the ?progression rate?. Results Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were higher in ALS cases than in controls (P < 0.0001). Using receiver operating curve analysis, an optimal NFL cut-off of 1981 ng/l discriminated between patients with ALS and neurological controls, with a sensitivity of 78.4% and specificity of 72.5%. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed the association between CSF NFL levels and the presence of ALS (age and sex adjusted odds ratio for ALS 8.9; 95% CI 3.1?25.8; P < 0.0001). In ALS, CSF NFL negatively correlated with the diagnostic delay (P < 0.0001) and the ALSFRS-r (P = 0.014) and positively with the progression rate (P < 0.0001). Conclusions High CSF NFL levels were found in patients with ALS, reflecting the burden of neurodegeneration. The significant relation between CSF NFL levels and disease progression suggests that NFL may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in ALS.

AB  - Summary Multi-systemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED) is a relatively uncommon disease characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of more than one organ system, with the skin and gastrointestinal tract most commonly affected. This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Abstract Aim Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Methods A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. Results The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-α (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004). Conclusion The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Background As a prerequisite in navigation-assisted surgery, a three-dimensional image data set with registration marker is necessary. Often patients are presented, not being aware of facing a computer-assisted surgical intervention (CAS), with an already performed computed tomography (CT) data set without marker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new method which allows performing CAS by enhancing the initial markerless data set with a marked subvolume gained by cone beam (CBCT) scan. Methods Therefore four registration markers are inserted and afterwards the patient is strongly limited to the field of interest scanned by CBCT scan (marked data set). Superimposed with the initial data set, a data set with reference markers and with full information is obtained. Registration procedure was performed with group A (25 patients, superimposed marked CBCT scan) and group B (25 patients, initially marked CT scan) using BrainLab? navigation by two observers and overall system accuracy was measured using the registration landmarks and additional intraoperative landmarks (tooth cusps). Results Adequate image quality assumed, no significant difference between group A and B was detected. Enhancing an initially performed data set with registration marker by using a marked subvolume could improve the workflow for navigation-assisted surgery due to the availability of cone beam scan technology, provide excellent resolution with reduced metal artifacts nearby dental restorations, and reduce radiation dose for the patient. Conclusion Regarding the advantages of the new method which allows performing CAS by enhancing the initial markerless data set with a marked subvolume gained by cone beam (CBCT) scan, this technique will play a major part in navigation-assisted surgery and will address widespread general methodological solutions that are of great interest in multidisciplinary treatment.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract The brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in June 1998 unleashed a storm of media, interest groups, high profile individuals and criticism on the Southeast Texas community of Jasper. The crime and subsequent response?from within the community as well as across the world?engulfed the entire town in a collective trauma. Using natural disaster literature/theory and employing an ecological approach, Jasper, Texas was investigated via an interrupted time series analysis to identify how the community changed as compared to a control community (Center, Texas) on crime, economic, health, educational, and social capital measures collected at multiple pre- and post-crime time points between 1995 and 2003. Differences-in-differences (DD) analysis revealed significant post-event changes in Jasper, as well as a surprising degree of resilience and lack of negative consequences. Interviews with residents conducted between March 2005 and 2007 identified how the community responded to the crisis and augmented quantitative findings with qualitative, field-informed interpretation. Interviews suggest the intervention of external organizations exacerbated the severity of the events. However, using strengths of specific local social institutions?including faith based, law enforcement, media, business sector and civic government organizations?the community effectively responded to the initial threat and to the potential negative ramifications of external entities.

AB  - Background Child survival initiatives historically prioritized efforts to reduce child morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases and maternal conditions. Little attention has been devoted to paediatric injuries in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the demographics and outcomes of paediatric injury in a sub-Saharan African country in an effort to improve prevention and treatment. Methods A prospective trauma registry was established at the two university teaching campuses of the University of Rwanda to record systematically patient demographics, prehospital care, initial physiology and patient outcomes from May 2011 to July 2015. Univariable analysis was performed for demographic characteristics, injury mechanisms, geographical location and outcomes. Multivariable analysis was performed for mortality estimates. Results Of 11?036 patients in the registry, 3010 (27·3 per cent) were under 18?years of age. Paediatric patients were predominantly boys (69·9 per cent) and the median age was 8?years. The mortality rate was 4·8 per cent. Falls were the most common injury (45·3 per cent), followed by road traffic accidents (30·9 per cent), burns (10·7 per cent) and blunt force/assault (7·5 per cent). Patients treated in the capital city, Kigali, had a higher incidence of head injury (7·6 per cent versus 2·0 per cent in a rural town, P?<?0·001; odds ratio (OR) 4·08, 95 per cent c.i. 2·61 to 6·38) and a higher overall injury-related mortality rate (adjusted OR 3·00, 1·50 to 6·01; P = 0·019). Pedestrians had higher overall injury-related mortality compared with other road users (adjusted OR 3·26, 1·37 to 7·73; P = 0·007). Conclusion Paediatric injury is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Delineating trauma demographics is important when planning resource utilization and capacity-building efforts to address paediatric injury in low-resource settings and identify vulnerable populations.

AB  - Summary Ever since the introduction of dissociative identity disorder (DID) into the DSM-III in 1980, controversy has swirled around the nature and the validity of this diagnosis. Some prominent authors who are skeptical about the validity of the DID diagnosis have proposed a sociocognitive model through which DID is thought to be caused by clinicians who believe strongly in the diagnosis and who covertly mold patients to enact the symptoms of DID. However, there are clearly DID presentations that are credible, and treatment outcome research has demonstrated that DID is responsive to treatment?quite the opposite from what one would expect if the DID was essentially a shared delusion between patients and their therapists. Although there is little evidence that DID can be created through a sociocognitive model where no underlying dissociation exists, it seems likely that the precise symptoms of dissociation can be molded through cultural expectations. Given that the expression of some dissociative symptomatology may be somewhat malleable, it behooves clinicians to not superimpose any particular model of symptoms on patients. Cases of severe dissociative disorders are not all uniform in their symptomatic expression, and not all cases of DID are static and unchanging in their level of dissociation over time. Although there is no clear evidence that authentic DID can be iatrogenically created, patients with lesser degrees of dissociation can be pushed into DID-like presentation by naïve or overzealous therapists. Pseudo-dissociation can also arise from patients who erroneously come to believe that they have DID. Some of these patients do have some dissociative symptoms and some have trauma in their backgrounds. Others seem to suffer primarily from severe personality disorders with intense identity diffusion and internal emptiness. DID can also be factitious or malingered, especially by patients who are somewhat knowledgeable about the disorder. However, careful attention to the patient's presentation and history can often distinguish between authentic and feigned presentations. Current and future research will do much to clarify the various presentations of dissociation. There will also be an increased level of sophistication regarding the assessment of patients, including an understanding of prognosis, and the application of treatment models and treatment modalities. There are also understudied areas in trauma psychiatry that deserve closer scrutiny, such as the effects of trauma on sexuality and understanding the perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In more traditional areas of study, more information is needed to assist clinicians to understand what processes in treatment actually help patients. Experienced and accomplished psychotherapists need to both study and write about what they do, in order to pass down their wisdom and expertise to others who struggle with uncertainty and isolation in their clinical practice, and to future generations of clinicians. Finally, the clinical and academic communities involved with trauma treatment have a responsibility to continue to educate the public and our governmental institutions about the effects of psychological trauma. Experts in the trauma field have an important role in educating others and ensuring that proper attention and resources are allocated to the victims of trauma and victimization.

AB  - Abstract Limb salvage in fungal osteomyelitis of the post-traumatic lower extremity represents a difficult clinical problem requiring aggressive management. We report lower extremity salvage by radical bony debridement, free tissue transfer, distraction osteogenesis with bone-docking, and a novel antifungal regimen in a clinical setting of infection with Scedosporium inflatum, historically requiring amputation in 100% of cases. We treated Scedosporium inflatum osteomyelitis of the tibia and calcaneus with radical debridement of infected bone, free partial medial rectus abdominis muscle flap coverage, transport distraction osteogenesis, and combination voriconazole/terbinafine chemotherapy, a novel antifungal regimen. We achieved successful control of the infection, limb salvage, and an excellent functional outcome through aggressive debridement of infected bone and soft tissue, elimination of dead space within the bony defect, the robust perfusion provided by the free flap, the hypervascular state induced by distraction osteogenesis, and the synergism of the novel antifungal regimen. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Background: Blast injury is uncommon, and remains poorly understood by most clinicians outside regions of active warfare. Primary blast injury (PBI) results from the interaction of the blast wave with the body, and typically affects gas-containing organs such as the ear, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This review investigates the mechanisms and injuries sustained to the abdomen following blast exposure. Methods: MEDLINE was searched using the keywords ?primary blast injury?, ?abdominal blast? and ?abdominal blast injury? to identify English language reports of abdominal PBI. Clinical reports providing sufficient data were used to calculate the incidence of abdominal PBI in hospitalized survivors of air blast, and in open- and enclosed-space detonations. Results: Sixty-one articles were identified that primarily reported clinical or experimental abdominal PBI. Nine clinical reports provided sufficient data to calculate an incidence of abdominal PBI; 31 (3·0 per cent) of 1040 hospitalized survivors of air blast suffered abdominal PBI, the incidence ranging from 1·3 to 33 per cent. The incidence for open- and enclosed-space detonations was 5·6 and 6·7 per cent respectively. The terminal ileum and caecum were the most commonly affected organs. Surgical management of abdominal PBI is similar to that of abdominal trauma of other causes. Conclusion: Abdominal PBI is uncommon but has the potential for significant mortality and morbidity, which may present many days after blast exposure. It is commoner after blast in enclosed spaces and under water. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

Methods: The right optic nerve of 29 male rats received a 5 second traumatic crush followed 30 minutes later by one of five intravenous treatments (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, or saline). Treatment was continued for three additional administrations at 6 hour intervals. Untreated sham controls (n = 7) were also prepared. Six weeks after injury, animals were sacrificed, perfused and optic nerves systematically counted. RESULTS: Axon counts (means +/? s.e.m.) were as follows: Saline = 16,670 +/? 8,900 (n = 5); Methylprednisolone: 30 mg/kg = 8,098 +/? 4,741 (n = 5); 60 mg/kg = 6,925 +/? 6,517 (n = 4); 90 mg/kg = 2,663 +/? 2,653 (n = 4); 120 mg/kg = 6,149 +/? 3,487 (n = 6). Consequently, the data revealed that saline treated animals retained more axons than those that were administered methylprednisolone (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that methylprednisolone exacerbates axonal loss following crush injury in the rat optic nerve. Based on the results of this study, clinical studies of traumatic optic neuropathy in the future should also examine the possibility that corticosteroid treatment may have an adverse effect on visual outcome following optic nerve trauma.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Purpose To visualize healthy and abnormal articular cartilage, we investigated the potential of using the 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) signal's magnitude and frequency and maps of relaxation. Materials and Methods After optimizing imaging parameters in five healthy volunteers, 3D multi-echo GRE magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 3T in four patients with chondral damage prior to their arthroscopic surgery. Average magnitude and frequency information was extracted from the GRE images, and maps were generated. Cartilage abnormalities were confirmed after arthroscopy and were graded using the Outerbridge classification scheme. Regions of interest were identified on average magnitude GRE images and compared to arthroscopy. Results All four patients presented with regions of Outerbridge Grade I and II cartilage damage on arthroscopy. One patient had Grade III changes. Grade I, II, and III changes were detectable on average magnitude and maps, while Grade II and higher changes were also observable on MR frequency maps. For average magnitude images of healthy volunteers, the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnitude image averaged over three echoes was 4.26?±?0.32, 12.26?±?1.09, 14.31?±?1.93, and 13.36?±?1.13 in bone, femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage, respectively. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using different imaging contrasts from the 3D multi-echo GRE scan to visualize abnormalities of the articular cartilage. ? 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Level of Evidence: 1 J.

AB  - Background Verrucous hemangioma (VH) presents clinically as a vascular malformation but has similar histopathologic features to infantile hemangioma. This study characterized the cell population within VH. Material and methods Paraffin-embedded sections from two male patients with VH were processed for immunohistochemistry. The expression of SMA, CD34, glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), D2-40, brachyury, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Oct-4, hemoglobin ? chain (HBZ), Wilms tumor protein (WT-1) and CD45 was examined. Results The lymphatic marker, D2-40, was not expressed in VH, whereas Glut-1 was widely expressed in infantile hemangioma, it was only focally expressed by the endothelium of VH. The endothelium of VH expressed the primitive markers, Oct-4, brachyury and ACE. The primitive marker, WT-1, was expressed predominantly on the pericyte layer of both VH and infantile hemangioma. However, HBZ was only expressed in infantile hemangioma. CD45, a mature hematopoetic marker, was expressed by cells within the interstitium, away from the endothelium of VH and infantile hemangioma. Discussion The expression of the primitive markers, Oct-4, brachyury and ACE on the endothelium, and WT-1 predominantly on the pericyte layer of VH shows a primitive microvascular phenotype similar to infantile hemangioma. However, the absence of the embryonic marker, HBZ, expressed only in first trimester placenta and in proliferating infantile hemangioma, suggests a different cellular origin. HBZ could be used to distinguish between the two conditions.

AB  - Compelling evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation play a role in stress regulation and in the etiologic basis of stress related disorders such as Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Here we describe the purpose and methods of an international consortium that was developed to study the role of epigenetics in PTSD. Inspired by the approach used in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we brought together investigators representing seven cohorts with a collective sample size of N?=?1147 that included detailed information on trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and genome-wide DNA methylation data. The objective of this consortium is to increase the analytical sample size by pooling data and combining expertise so that DNA methylation patterns associated with PTSD can be identified. Several quality control and analytical pipelines were evaluated for their control of genomic inflation and technical artifacts with a joint analysis procedure established to derive comparable data over the cohorts for meta-analysis. We propose methods to deal with ancestry population stratification and type I error inflation and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying robust error estimates. To evaluate our pipeline, we report results from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of age, which is a well-characterized phenotype with known epigenetic associations. Overall, while EWAS are highly complex and subject to similar challenges as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we demonstrate that an epigenetic meta-analysis with a relatively modest sample size can be well-powered to identify epigenetic associations. Our pipeline can be used as a framework for consortium efforts for EWAS.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Embedded in the Collaborative Research Center ?Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders? (CRC-TRR58), this bicentric clinical study aims at identifying biobehavioral markers of treatment (non-)response by applying machine learning methodology with an external cross-validation protocol. We hypothesize that a priori prediction of treatment (non-)response is possible in a second, independent sample based on multimodal markers. Methods One-session virtual reality exposure treatment (VRET) with patients with spider phobia was conducted on two sites. Clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic data were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and after 6 months. The primary and secondary outcomes defining treatment response are as follows: 30% reduction regarding the individual score in the Spider Phobia Questionnaire and 50% reduction regarding the individual distance in the behavioral avoidance test. Results N = 204 patients have been included (n = 100 in Würzburg, n = 104 in Münster). Sample characteristics for both sites are comparable. Discussion This study will offer cross-validated theranostic markers for predicting the individual success of exposure-based therapy. Findings will support clinical decision-making on personalized therapy, bridge the gap between basic and clinical research, and bring stratified therapy into reach. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03208400).
