AB  - Abstract This paper studies the impact of multi-layered transport exclusion on the mobility and accessibility of Palestinian women in Jerusalem. Ethnic segregation, hostile social climate, poor infrastructure and low levels of public transportation create multifaceted barriers to daily travel throughout the city. This research sheds light on the individual needs and decisions of women in making their travel choices in an exclusionary urban environment. This research is based on eight in-depth interviews and 38 participants in focus-group of Palestinian women living in East Jerusalem. It examines their public transport and private car use, in light of physical and psychological barriers. Interviews find that cultural and social pressures and the sense of exclusion and fear pose significant limitations to public transport use and destination choice, alongside poor infrastructure, low service levels and discriminatory planning policies. Many women internalize expectations of violence and exclusionary linguistic and visual cues, which serve as fear-based barriers for public transport use. Women's responses fall into a number of categories: avoiding West Jerusalem and minimizing travel; adopting private cars as safer and more practical or, at times, accepting and barrelling through fears. Policy implications include both immediate changes to symbology and behaviour of transport personnel, and long term implications about consciously-inclusive route and infrastructure planning.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dental cementum covering the tooth root is similar to bone in several respects but remains poorly understood in terms of development and differentiation of cementoblasts, as well as the potential function(s) of cementocytes residing in the cellular cementum. It is not known if the cementocyte is a dynamic actor in cementum metabolism, comparable to the osteocyte in the bone. Cementocytes exhibit irregular spacing and lacunar shape, with fewer canalicular connections compared with osteocytes. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the in vivo expression profile of cementocytes paralleled that of osteocytes, including expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1/DMP1), Sost/sclerostin, E11/gp38/podoplanin, Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin [OPG]), and Tnfsf11 (receptor activator of NF-?B ligand [RANKL]). We used the Immortomouse+/?; Dmp1-GFP+/? mice to isolate cementocytes as Dmp1-expressing cells followed by immortalization using the interferon (IFN)-?-inducible promoter driving expression of a thermolabile large T antigen to create the first immortalized line of cementocytes, IDG-CM6. This cell line reproduced the expression profile of cementocytes observed in vivo, including alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. IDG-CM6 cells expressed higher levels of Tnfrsf11b and lower levels of Tnfsf11 compared with IDG-SW3 osteocytes, and under fluid flow shear stress, IDG-CM6 cells significantly increased OPG while decreasing RANKL, leading to a significantly increased OPG/RANKL ratio, which would inhibit osteoclast activation. These studies indicate similarities yet potentially important differences in the function of cementocytes compared with osteocytes and support cementocytes as mechanically responsive cells. ? 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Premise of the Study Euphyllophytes, a clade including living ferns, horsetails, and seed plants, have a rich fossil record going back to the Early Devonian. The euphyllophyte spore wall has a complex structure, the evolutionary origins of which are incompletely understood. Psilophyton is the best-characterized basal euphyllophyte genus; thus, data on this genus can inform current hypotheses on spore wall structure and development, which propose a bilayered spore wall organization of combined spore and sporangial origin for the ancestral euphyllophyte. Methods We employed cellulose acetate peel sectioning of permineralized Lower Devonian (Emsian) Psilophyton dawsonii sporangia, combined with electron microscopy, to document spore wall structure and development. Key Results The Psilophyton dawsonii spore wall is bilayered. The inner spore wall is homogeneous, probably of lamellar construction. The outer spore wall, loosely attached to the inner wall, covers distal and equatorial spore areas, and has a foveolate base layer upon which stacks of sporopollenin lumps accrete centrifugally, forming the scaffolding for the final apiculate ornamentation. Conclusions This is the most complete account on spore wall structure, allowing developmental interpretations, in a basal euphyllophyte. The bipartite organization of the Psilophyton dawsonii spore wall reflects development as a result of two processes: an inner layer laid down by the spore cell and an outer layer of tapetal origin. Providing direct evidence on the spore wall of a basal euphyllophyte, these data confirm previous hypotheses and mark an empirically supported starting point for discussions of the evolution of spore wall development in euphyllophytes.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Exercise-induced changes of transverse proton relaxation time (T2), tissue perfusion and metabolic turnover were investigated in the lower back muscles of volunteers by applying muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before and after as well as dynamic 31P-MRS during the exercise. Inner (M. multifidus, MF) and outer lower back muscles (M. erector spinae, ES) were examined in 14 healthy young men performing a sustained isometric trunk-extension. Significant phosphocreatine (PCr) depletions ranging from 30% (ES) to 34% (MF) and Pi accumulations between 95% (left ES) and 120%?140% (MF muscles and right ES) were observed during the exercise, which were accompanied by significantly decreased pH values in all muscles (?pH?â??0.05). Baseline T2 values were similar across all investigated muscles (approximately 27?ms at 3?T), but revealed right?left asymmetric increases (T2,inc) after the exercise (right ES/MF: T2,inc?=?11.8/9.7%; left ES/MF: T2,inc?=?4.6/8.9%). Analyzed muscles also showed load-induced increases in molecular diffusion D (p?=?.007) and perfusion fraction f (p?=?.002). The latter parameter was significantly higher in the MF than in the ES muscles both at rest and post exercise. Changes in PCr (p?=?.03), diffusion (p?<?.01) and perfusion (p?=?.03) were strongly associated with T2,inc, and linear mixed model analysis revealed that changes in PCr and perfusion both affect T2,inc (p?<?.001). These findings support previous assumptions that T2 changes are not only an intra-cellular phenomenon resulting from metabolic stress but are also affected by increased perfusion in loaded muscles.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Chronic alcohol-dependent patients have reduced brain volumes and concomitant neurobehavioral deficits that may recover during abstinence. In 10 chronic alcoholic patients, using localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found reliable increases during the first 3?4 weeks of abstinence in the concentrations within the superior cerebellar vermis of choline (Cho)-containing compounds relative to the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Lesser changes were observed following 1 month of abstinence, and in one of the patients studied longitudinally over 3 months, a marked reduction in the Cho/NAA ratio was associated with relapse. After detoxification, the Cho/NAA ratio correlated with a composite clinical impression of brain functions. The lowest Cho/NAA was observed in a patient with persisting alcoholic dementia, in striking contrast to reduced relative concentrations of NAA reported in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Possible molecular explanations for these brain metabolic changes are discussed.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - This essay considers the relation of history to memory in the process of radical political change. Looking at the work of William Kentridge in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it argues the ways that the language of nation-building fails to account for the experience of trauma as it resists absorption into the structures of historical time and the ?talking cure?. In particular, it considers how Kentridge's unique graphic techniques of film animation contest the logic of closure, recovery and renewal that the political and psychic imperatives of ?new? nationhood seem to demand. In the radical upheaval to which he submits visuality as much as chronology and teleology, and in the eruption of historical debris through the visual surface, his work disables all sense of resolution.

AB  - Microglia are rapidly activated in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to a variety of injuries, including inflammation, trauma, and stroke. In addition to modulation of the innate immune response, a key function of microglia is the phagocytosis of dying cells and cellular debris, which can facilitate recovery. Despite emerging evidence that axonal debris can pose a barrier to regeneration of new axons in the CNS, little is known of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie clearance of degenerating CNS axons. We utilize a custom micropatterned microfluidic system that enables robust microglial-axon co-culture to explore the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in microglial phagocytosis of degenerating axons. We find that pharmacologic and genetic disruption of TLR4 blocks induction of the Type-1 interferon response and inhibits phagocytosis of axon debris in vitro. Moreover, TLR4-dependent microglial clearance of unmyelinated axon debris facilitates axon outgrowth. In vivo, microglial phagocytosis of CNS axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration in a dorsal root axotomy model is impaired in adult mice in which TLR4 has been deleted. Since purinergic receptors can influence TLR4-mediated signaling, we also explored a role for the microglia P2 receptors and found that the P2X7R contributes to microglial clearance of degenerating axons. Overall, we identify TLR4 as a key player in axonal debris clearance by microglia, thus creating a more permissive environment for axonal outgrowth. Our findings have significant implications for the development of protective and regenerative strategies for the many inflammatory, traumatic, and neurodegenerative conditions characterized by CNS axon degeneration.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the purpose, principle, specifications, and applications of electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG machines are used for diagnosing a variety of neurologic diseases, such as epilepsy, convulsive disorders, brain death, cerebrovascular lesions, ischaemia, and problems associated with trauma. The brain generates rhythmical potentials, which originate in the individual neurons of the brain. The EEG signals are of great diagnostic value both in terms of their amplitude and frequency. EEG signals picked up by the surface electrodes are usually small as compared with the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Modern EEG monitors use computers to analyse and generate large amounts of electroencephalographic data, which are processed and displayed in various formats. EEG electrodes give high skin contact impedance as compared with ECG electrodes. EEG preamplifiers are generally designed to have a very high value of input impedance to take care of high electrode impedance.

Prior to presentation to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UVTH), the colt had been treated intensively in a private equine hospital for presumed antimicrobial-induced enterocolitis following treatment with azithromycin and rifampin, and had been discharged on treatment of doxycycline for continued lower airway abnormalities. At the UVTH, investigation of the lower airway disease included a culture of a percutaneous transtracheal wash, which identified a multiple-drug resistant strain of A. baumannii as the causative agent with sensitivity only to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim sulphonamides. Following treatment with marbofloxacin there was full resolution of the bronchopneumonia. A. baumannii is a major nosocomial pathogen associated with infections in both animals and man and reports of multiple-drug resistant strains have been documented worldwide. Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections have been reported to occur in very ill human patients housed in healthcare settings such as intensive care units, and are characterised by the rapid development of resistance to the majority of antimicrobials. The difficulties in the treatment of such cases as well as the potential risk of transmission within a veterinary clinical setting are discussed.

AB  - Aims (a) To investigate the utility of childhood PE as a predictor of adolescent psychopathology while accounting for three known risk factors: childhood mental disorder; traumatic experiences and poor childhood functioning, and (b) to investigate the additive effects of including childhood PE in predictive clinical model of adolescent psychopathology. Method The study sample comprised of 86 Irish youths who completed two waves of the ?Adolescent Brain Development? study (baseline age: 11.7 and follow-up age: 15.7). At baseline, participants completed a clinical interview assessing for PE, mental disorders, traumatic experiences and global functioning in childhood. The internalizing and externalizing problems sub-scales from the Youth Self Report questionnaire were used as follow-up outcomes variables in adolescence. Results Logistic regression analyses revealed that childhood PE was the only predictor significantly associated with both internalizing (univariate OR: 7.58, CI: 2.59-22.15; multivariate OR: 5.43, CI: 1.53-19.29) and externalizing (univariate OR: 11.76, CI: 3.70-37.41; multivariate OR: 30.39, CI: 5.28-174.80) problems in adolescence. All predictive models with PE significantly predicted adolescent outcomes (area under the curve range: 0.70-0.81; all P?<?0.05) and adding PE to the models improved the predictive value for externalizing problems (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Childhood PE is a powerful predictor of adolescent psychopathology, particularly for externalizing problems. Routine assessment of PE and targeted support for children who report PE may reduce the incidence of mental disorder in adolescence.

AB  - Summary Thoracic surgery addresses the operative repair of the chest wall and organs within the chest cavity (principally the lungs and oesophagus) exclusive of the heart and great vessels. Common surgical conditions include chest trauma, chest wall deformities and tumours, pleural effusion and empyema, pneumothorax, gastro-oesophageal reflux and oesophageal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and mediastinal tumours. Minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS) or open thoracotomy may be employed to access and/or remove the pathology. Surgery is very effective in managing the majority of these conditions and patients with malignant tumours may receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as an adjuvant or definitive therapy depending on tumour staging.
