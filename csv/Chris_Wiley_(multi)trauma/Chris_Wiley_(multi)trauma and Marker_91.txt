AB  - Objective? To evaluate the accuracy of linear measurements obtained from computer tomography (CT) images of staged radio-ulnar incongruence in a canine cadaver forelimb model. Study Design? CT evaluation of induced progressive radio-ulnar incongruence in canine cadaveric forelimbs. Sample Population? Eight cadaveric canine left forelimbs. Procedure? A type 2 external skeletal fixator (ESF) with linear motors was attached to the radius in 8 cadaveric left canine forelimbs. Contiguous incremental and helical CT images of the proximal radio-ulnar articulation were acquired in the transverse, sagittal and dorsal planes. The radius was shortened by 1, 2, and 4?mm increments and scanning protocols were repeated at each increment. Digital caliper and CT image analysis measured the progressive change in distance between 2 marking spheres and the epiphyseal bone surfaces of the radio-ulnar articulation. Statistical analysis of measurements from incremental and helical CT acquisitions, and direct and reformatted images were compared with inter-sphere distance using Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. Results? The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the mid-coronoid in the oblique plane had the highest correlation coefficient (r-value) at 0.908. The mid-coronoid in the dorsal plane had the second highest r-value (0.856). The coronoid incisure in the sagittal plane had an r-value of 0.826. The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the coronoid incisure in the oblique plane had the lowest r-value, 0.592. Conclusion? Measurement of radioulnar incongruence may be best performed using reformatted incremental acquisition CT in the mid-coronoid region in an oblique plane. Clinical Relevance? Use of the technique reported in this study may enable determination of the association, if any, between radioulnar incongruence and developmental diseases of the canine elbow.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Summary Background The objective of this study was to determine factors predictive of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) upon discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among patients who receive a tracheostomy during their stay. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS) database. Patients <18 years old admitted between 2009-2011 who required MV for at least 3 days and received a tracheostomy during their PICU stay were included. Results A total of 680 pediatric patients from 74 PICUs were included, of whom 347 (51%) remained on MV at the time of PICU discharge. Neonates (30/38, 79%) and infants (129/203, 64%) required MV at PICU discharge after tracheostomy more often than adolescents (66/141, 47%) and children (122/298, 41%). Time on MV pre-tracheostomy was longer among those who required MV at discharge (median 18.3 vs. 13.8 days, P?<?0.0001); however, number of failed extubations was similar (median 1 for both groups, P?=?0.97). On mixed-effects multivariable regression analysis, the age categories of neonate (OR?2.9, 95%CI 1.1?7.6, P?=?0.03), and infant (OR?1.7, 95%CI 1.1?2.8, P?=?0.03), and ventilator days prior to tracheostomy (OR?1.01, 95%CI 1.0?1.02, P?=?0.01) were significantly associated with increased odds of MV upon PICU discharge, while being a trauma admission was associated with decreased odds (OR?0.45, 95%CI 0.28?0.73, P?=?0.001). Conclusions Younger patients and those with prolonged courses of MV prior to tracheostomy are more likely to continue to need MV upon PICU discharge.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Abstract Older people experience skeletal muscle wasting, in part due to impaired proliferative capacity of quiescent skeletal muscle satellite cells which can be reversed by exposure to young blood. To investigate the role of immune cells in muscle regeneration, we isolated lymphocytes from whole blood of young and older healthy volunteers and cultured them with, or without, anti-CD3/CD28 activators to induce release of cytokines, interleukins, and growth factors into the media. The secreted proteins were collected to prepare a conditioned media, which was subsequently used to culture C2C12 myoblasts. The conditioned media from the activated young lymphocytes increased the rate of proliferation of myoblasts by around threefold (P < 0.005) and caused an approximate fourfold (P < 0.005) increase in migration compared with nonactivated lymphocyte control media. These responses were characterized by minimal myotube formation (2%), low fusion index (5%), low myosin heavy chain content, and substantial migration. In contrast, myoblasts treated with conditioned media from activated old lymphocytes exhibited a high degree of differentiation, and multi-nucleated myotube formation that was comparable to control conditions, thus showing no effect on proliferation or migration of myoblasts. These results indicate that secreted proteins from lymphocytes of young people enhance the muscle cell proliferation and migration, whereas secreted proteins from lymphocytes of older people may contribute to the attenuated skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and migration.

AB  - Abstract This study sought to investigate the efficacy of prolonged exposure, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and relaxation training on trait anger and guilt and on trauma-related anger and guilt within the context of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment. Fifteen PTSD patients completed each treatment and were assessed at posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up. All three treatments were associated with significant reductions in all measures of anger and guilt, with gains maintained at follow-up. There were no significant treatment differences in efficacy or in the proportion of patients who worsened on anger or guilt measures over the course of treatment. Between-treatment effect sizes were generally very small. Results suggest that all three treatments are associated with reductions in anger and guilt, even for patients who initially have high levels of these emotions. However, these PTSD therapies may not be sufficient for treating anger and guilt; additional interventions may be required.

The results of 18 studies are reviewed in this article. In both open label and double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, botulinum toxin has proven to be an effective measure for reduction of focal spasticity. Improvements have been documented in tone reduction, range of motion, hygiene, autonomic dysreflexia, gait pattern, positioning, and other criteria, though not all criteria tested showed improvement in all studies. In none of the studies were there significant adverse effects. Future trials may be improved by refinement of several design parameters, including patient selection, treatment timing, and selection of dose and injection site. ? 1997 John Wiley  20(suppl 6):S169-S175.

AB  - Background Alterations in gray matter development represent a potential pathway through which childhood abuse is associated with psychopathology. Several prior studies find reduced volume and thickness of prefrontal (PFC) and temporal cortex regions in abused compared with nonabused adolescents, although most prior research is based on adults and volume-based measures. This study tests the hypothesis that child abuse, independent of parental education, predicts reduced cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporal cortices as well as reduced gray mater volume (GMV) in subcortical regions during adolescence. Methods Structural MRI scans were obtained from 21 adolescents exposed to physical and/or sexual abuse and 37 nonabused adolescents (ages 13?20). Abuse was operationalized using dichotomous and continuous measures. We examined associations between abuse and brain structure in several a priori-defined regions, controlling for parental education, age, sex, race, and total brain volume for subcortical GMV. Significance was evaluated at p < .05 with a false discovery rate correction. Results Child abuse exposure and severity were associated with reduced thickness in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), left temporal pole, and bilateral inferior, right middle, and right superior temporal gyri. Neither abuse measure predicted cortical surface area or subcortical GMV. Bilateral PHG thickness was inversely related to externalizing symptoms. Conclusions Child abuse, an experience characterized by a high degree of threat, is associated with reduced cortical thickness in ventromedial and ventrolateral PFC and medial and lateral temporal cortex in adolescence. Reduced PHG thickness may be a mediator linking abuse with externalizing psychopathology, although prospective research is needed to evaluate this possibility.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ?humanized? transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples.

AB  - The particular combination of polydeoxyribonucleotides, l-carnitine, calcium ions, proteolytic enzyme and other ingredients acts in a synergetic way in the regeneration of skin and connective tissues. This new formulation of active principles was tested in vitro as a cell and tissue culture medium and in vivo for various preparations in support of tissue regeneration. In vitro, the new blend allowed the maintenance of skin biopsies for more than 1?year in eutrophic conditions. Immunocytochemical analyses of fibroblasts isolated from these biopsies confirmed a significant increase of the epidermal and connective wound-healing markers such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, cytokeratin 1 (CK1), CK5, CK10 and CK14 versus controls. To examine the effects of the new compound in vivo, we studied impaired wound healing in genetically diabetic db/db mice. At day?18, diabetic mice treated with the new composition showed 100% closure of wounds and faster healing than mice treated with the other solutions. This complex of vital continuity factors or life-keeping factors could be used as a tissue-preserving solution or a cosmetic/drug/medical device to accelerate wound healing in the treatment of patients with deficient wound repair to promote the regeneration of cutaneous and connective tissues (injuries?wound, dermatitis) and prevent the recurrent relapses.

AB  - Summary Research in the last decade has revealed that bone is not only a target tissue for numerous circulating hormones but functions as an endocrine organ itself. As a recent study demonstrated a stimulatory effect of the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin (OCN) on testosterone production in mice, we investigated whether such an association can be replicated in humans. We used data from 1338 men (25?86 years) in the population-based epidemiological Study of Health in Pomerania and from 110 male outpatients with bone disorders (18?85 years) for the study. We analysed cross-sectional associations between OCN and total testosterone serum concentrations (TT), as well as associations between further markers of bone turnover [bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), serum C-terminal telopeptides of Type I collagen (CTX), urinary deoxypyridinoline] and TT using ordinary least square (OLS) regression models. Multivariable OLS models revealed a positive association between OCN and TT in the population-based (? coefficients for a one standard deviation increase, 0.590; standard error (SE), 0.175; p-value, <0.01) and patient-based (? coefficient, 0.575; SE, 0.132; p-value, <0.01) samples even after adjustment for age and body mass index (both samples), and time of blood sampling (population-based sample only). Furthermore, we observed positive associations between BAP and TT (? coefficient, 0.403; SE, 0.170; p-value, 0.02) as well as between CTX and TT (? coefficient, 0.733; SE, 0.172; p-value, <0.01) in men from the general population. The present investigation shows that OCN is associated with TT in the general population and in patients with bone disorders, and may thus indicate general male health status. Additional longitudinal observational studies are warranted to confirm our findings and future experimental research is necessary to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the observed associations.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - Background Admission lactate and lactate clearance are implemented for risk stratification in sepsis and trauma. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results regarding outcome and lactate are conflicting. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management trial in which 950 unconscious patents after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to a temperature intervention of 33°C or 36°C. Serial lactate samples during the first 36 hours were collected. Admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and the clearance of lactate within 12 hours after admission were analyzed and the association with 30-day mortality assessed. Results Samples from 877 patients were analyzed. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for death by day 30 for each mmol/L was 1.12 (1.08-1.16) for admission lactate, P < .01, 1.21 (1.12-1.31) for 12-hour lactate, P < .01, and 1.003 (1.00-1.01) for each percentage point increase in 12-hour lactate clearance, P = .03. Only admission lactate and 12-hour lactate levels remained significant after adjusting for known predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (0.61-0.69), P < .001, 0.61 (0.57-0.65), P < .001, and 0.53 (0.49-0.57), P = .15 for admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and 12-hour lactate clearance, respectively. Conclusions Admission lactate and 12-hour lactate values were independently associated with 30-day mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while 12-hour lactate clearance was not. The clinical value of lactate as the sole predictor of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is, however, limited.

AB  - Abstract Dissociative experiences are characterized by a disruption in integration of consciousness, attention, and/or memory. Most individuals have some dissociative experiences (such as ?highway hypnosis?), but some individuals have remarkably frequent and intense dissociative experiences (as in the case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder)). We hypothesized that individual differences in dissociative experiences may have an attentional basis and/or effect on attentional mechanisms. We report on a study in which we selected high and low dissociators, as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (Bernstein and Putnam, 1986) and we evaluated each group's performance on a basic Stroop interference task with incongruent colour terms and control stimuli. We found that the high dissociators showed greater Stroop interference than did the low dissociators. We discuss our current theoretical understanding of this relationship in which we speculate that a history of trauma is an important causal factor in both high levels of dissociative experiences and changes in basic attentional strategies and mechanisms.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mast cells, important sensor and effector cells of the immune system, may influence bone metabolism as their number is increased in osteoporotic patients. They are also present during bone fracture healing with currently unknown functions. Using a novel c-Kit-independent mouse model of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrated that mast cells did not affect physiological bone turnover. However, they triggered local and systemic inflammation after fracture by inducing release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of innate immune cells. In later healing stages, mast cells accumulated and regulated osteoclast activity to remodel the bony fracture callus. Furthermore, they were essential to induce osteoclast formation after ovariectomy. Additional in vitro studies revealed that they promote osteoclastogenesis via granular mediators, mainly histamine. In conclusion, mast cells are redundant in physiologic bone turnover but exert crucial functions after challenging the system, implicating mast cells as a potential target for treating inflammatory bone disorders. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
