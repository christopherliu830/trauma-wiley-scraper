AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Abstract Dissociative experiences are characterized by a disruption in integration of consciousness, attention, and/or memory. Most individuals have some dissociative experiences (such as ?highway hypnosis?), but some individuals have remarkably frequent and intense dissociative experiences (as in the case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder)). We hypothesized that individual differences in dissociative experiences may have an attentional basis and/or effect on attentional mechanisms. We report on a study in which we selected high and low dissociators, as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (Bernstein and Putnam, 1986) and we evaluated each group's performance on a basic Stroop interference task with incongruent colour terms and control stimuli. We found that the high dissociators showed greater Stroop interference than did the low dissociators. We discuss our current theoretical understanding of this relationship in which we speculate that a history of trauma is an important causal factor in both high levels of dissociative experiences and changes in basic attentional strategies and mechanisms.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - Abstract Background? Olmsted syndrome is a rare keratinization disorder characterized by mutilating palmoplantar and periorificial keratoderma as the two major diagnostic features. Some authors believe that atypical cases without this standard combination may not really belong to Olmsted syndrome. Herein, we describe two familial cases with congenital nonmutilating palmoplantar and periorificial keratoderma, and discuss their similarities and differences with Olmsted syndrome. Patients? The study included two sisters who presented with focal and punctate nonmutilating palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), periorificial hyperkeratotic plaques, and widely distributed keratotic lesions. Fragile denuded areas of the skin were found in sites exposed to trauma. Fingernails showed a characteristic form of leukonychia. Results? Histopathology of plantar keratoderma showed psoriasiform hyperplasia with marked compact hyperkeratosis, while vicinity of denuded skin revealed thin parakeratotic zone and dissolution of the granular cell layer. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated suprabasal staining pattern for acidic keratin (AE1) and uniform positivity, starting four to six layers above the basal layer, for cytokeratin 10. Electron microscopy showed defective keratinization. Cytogenetic studies revealed normal karyotype and no chromosomal breakage. Conclusion? Our cases share Olmsted syndrome in the early onset, and the presence of symmetrical PPK, periorificial keratoderma and keratotic lesions. However, the striking nonmutilating nature of PPK and the presence of unique features in our patients suggest a newly described keratinization disorder.

AB  - Abstract The Museum Vrolik collection of anatomical specimens in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, comprises over 5,000 specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, we rediagnosed a subset of the collection comprising dried infantile, juvenile, and adult human skulls with congenital and acquired conditions. On external examination and additional radiography, we found 58 skulls with craniosynostosis (CS) involving one or more sutures and 40 skulls with a presumed suture related condition. Most of these were part of the material collected and described by Louis Bolk (1866?1930). Analysis of his observations suggests that skull deformation because of premature suture closure depends not only on the identity of the sutures involved but also on the timing and progression of their closure and the extent of their involvement. Moreover, premature closure of the sagittal suture after 3?6 years of age appeared to be much more common than expected because it is not accompanied by skull deformation. Many of the skulls with single-suture CS were microcephalic, which may be the cause of the premature synostosis. By contrast, microcephaly may be a resulting phenomenon in multi-suture CS. We noticed that the quotient between height of the cranial vault (vertex-porion distance) and head circumference, multiplied by 100, was 26 or higher only in those CS cases with multi-suture involvement. We therefore consider this parameter, which we named ?acrocephalic index,? to be an indicator of multi-suture involvement in individual CS cases. In two adult skulls, the skull had a quadrangular shape, which we assumed to be correlated to the presence of an unusually interdigitated open metopic suture. We propose to name this anomaly: tetragonocephaly. Another presumed suture-related condition, bathrocephaly, was found concomitantly with basilar invagination in several cases. We hypothesize that the chronically raised intracranial pressure in these cases caused the still open lambdoidal sutures to distend and the occipital bone to protrude. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary There has been a recent dramatic increase in understanding how to replace neurons lost through aging, trauma or disease and how to repair brain damage with significant functional recovery in a variety of models of human neurodegenerative disease. Donor factors identified in various models indicate that underlying successful cell transplantation in the nervous system critically include cell harvesting at an appropriate stage notably in embryonic or neonatal development. Also necessary are an appropriate nutritive environment for cell growth and appropriate techniques of cell implantation. Animal and other models have demonstrated the potential feasibility of using cells for repair of central nervous system disorders but for the present time functional clinical use of such cells remains an innovation in development at least in part due to the complex and precisely organized anatomical structures involved. There are also donor supply and ethics issues and conflicting clinical trial work, however, clinicians are working to achieve consensus through the application of evidence-based medicine.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

Glucan phosphate administration is associated with stimulation of immunity and a concomitant increase in resistance to a variety of experimentally induced disease states. Preclinical safety evaluation indicates that glucan phosphate does not induce mortality or significant toxicity over a wide dose range. Phase I clinical data indicate that glucan phosphate will ameliorate immunosuppression, stimulate immunity, decrease susceptibility to infection and alter ultimate outcome in trauma patients following laparotomy or thoracotomy. This work reviews the development, characterization, preclinal and clinical evaluation of glucan phosphate.

AB  - Summary Correct pulpal diagnosis is the key to all endodontic treatments. It is paramount to have established a clinical diagnosis of the pulp and the periapical tissue prior cutting access into the pulp chamber or to do any other treatment to a tooth. Clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests in addition to a comprehensive knowledge of the reaction of the pulp to caries, operative manipulations, trauma, and periodontal disease, enable us to establish an empirical pulp diagnosis only. The history of symptoms for the diagnosis of reversible pulpitis will mainly reveal provoked pain or sensation, and the tooth will only bother the patient when the tooth is exposed to a hot and/or cold or other excitatory stimuli. Like pulpal inflammation, the periapical inflammation can be symptom-free and only diagnosed in a chronic phase on a periapical radiograph. Determining the endodontic diagnosis prior to any invasive endodontic, or even any dental, procedure is paramount.

AB  - Abstract Perfusion bioreactor plays important role in supporting 3D bone construct development. Scaffolds of chitosan composites have been studied to support bone tissue regeneration from osteogenic progenitor cells including human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). In this study, porous scaffolds of hydroxyapatite (H), chitosan (C), and gelatin (G) were fabricated by phase-separation and press-fitted in the perfusion bioreactor system where media flow is configured either parallel or transverse with respect to the scaffolds to investigate the impact of flow configuration on hMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The in vitro results showed that the interstitial flow in the transverse flow (TF) constructs reduced cell growth during the first week of culture but improved spatial cell distribution and early onset of osteogenic differentiation measured by alkaline phosphatase and expression of osteogenic genes. After 14 days of bioreactor culture, the TF constructs have comparable cell number but higher expression of bone markers genes and proteins compared to the parallel flow constructs. To evaluate ectopic bone formation, the HCG constructs seeded with hMSCs pre-cultured under two flow configurations for 7 days were implanted in CD-1 nude mice. While Masson's Trichrom staining revealed bone formation in both constructs, the TF constructs have improved spatial cell and osteoid distribution throughout the 2.0 mm constructs. The results highlight the divergent effects of media flow over the course of construct development and suggest that the flow configuration is an important parameter regulating the cellular events leading to bone construct formation in the HCG scaffolds. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The publisher has replaced the incorrect version of the published article with the correct version containing Table 1. For archival purposes, the earlier version is available by contacting the publisher at headandneck@wiley.com. This should be considered the definitive version of this article. Background. The detection of the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in nasal secretions contaminated with blood and mucus remains a challenging clinical problem. Methods. A prospective study was conducted from November 1998 to February 2002, including 42 patients. Samples (250 ?L) of nasal secretions were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Plasma, mucus, and CSF were identified by specific proteins markers corresponding to characteristic trains of spots. Intrathecal injection of fluorescein followed by the detection of fluorescein on endoscopic examination of the nasal cavities was considered a positive reference for CSF rhinorrhea. Results. In all cases of positive fluorescein test, we unambiguously observed the presence of several specific CSF markers onto the 2-DE gels. Conversely, all negative fluorescein tests were associated with the absence of CSF-specific spots. Conclusions. Two-DE analyses of biologic fluids of nasal origin should be considered as a reliable diagnostic tool in case of suspicion of CSF leak. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 464?469, 2003

AB  - Abstract Estimates suggest that 15% of children in the United Kingdom have been exposed to at least one form of domestic violence (DV) during their childhood, with more than 3% having witnessed an incident during the past year. This exposure increases the risk of children suffering both short-term and long-term impacts, including effects on their behaviour, social development, physical and mental health, educational attainment and quality of life. In addition, children living in environments where there is DV are at higher risk of maltreatment. Adult relatives and friends of the family often observe the experiences of children in situations of DV, and have the potential to shed light in a way that children and survivors may struggle to articulate, or be reluctant to acknowledge or disclose. Such accounts are largely absent from existing research, and yet bring a perspective which can broaden our understanding of the impact that DV has on children. This paper reports a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected during 21 in-depth interviews with people across the United Kingdom who were a friend or family member of a woman experiencing DV. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken and the themes generated were as follows: ?the context of DV: a chaotic and unpredictable home life?; ?the roles children assume within households where there is DV including: witness of, victim of and conduit of violence and abuse?,; ?the impacts of DV on children?; and ?children's coping and resilience?. The implications of these findings are discussed using a basic needs model lens.

AB  - Abstract During pregnancy, traumas can threaten maternal and fetal health. Various trauma effects on a pregnant uterus are little investigated. In the present study, a finite element model of a uterus along with a fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and two most effective ligament sets is developed. This model allows numerical evaluation of various loading on a pregnant uterus. The model geometry is developed based on CT-scan data and validated using anthropometric data. Applying Ogden hyper-elastic theory, material properties of uterine wall and placenta are developed. After simulating the ?rigid-bar? abdominal loading, the impact force and abdominal penetration are investigated. Findings are compared with the experimental abdominal response corridor, previously developed for a nonpregnant abdomen. ?Response corridor? denotes a bounded envelope in response space, within which the system responses usually lie. Results show that at low abdominal penetrations (less than 45 mm), the pregnant abdomen response is highly compatible with the nonpregnant case. While, at large penetrations, the pregnant abdomen demonstrates stiffer behavior. The reason must be the existence of a fetus in the model. This reveals that the existing response corridors would not be reliable to be extended for a pregnant abdomen. Hence, response corridor development for a pregnant abdomen is a crucial task. In this study, a new fixed-back rigid-bar loading response corridor is proposed for a pregnant abdomen using the load-penetration behavior of the developed model. This model and response corridor can help to study the pregnant uterus response to environmental loading and investigate the injury risk to the uterus and fetus.

AB  - Abstract It is widely acknowledged that advertisers employ primarily two types of persuasion strategies?rational vs. emotional?to persuade consumers to buy their products. While a rational appeal is driven by information processing by the conscious mind, in contrast, an emotional appeal is propelled by the unconscious mind or gut-feeling(s), which has its own rewards and risks. The main goals of this paper are two-fold: (1) to present a mechanism of encoding and decoding emotions rooted in the language; and (2) to identify linguistic markers and strategies of an emotional ad. In addition to imagery, the role of language in emotional advertising is undisputed. A linguistic analysis of monolingual as well as bilingual/multilingual ads is performed to show how language regulates desired emotional effects, identities, and appeals.

AB  - Summary Central venous obstruction can have profound systemic effects, particularly when venous return is affected. Interventional radiology techniques have been used to palliate both malignant and non-malignant causes of vascular obstruction for both intrinsic and extrinsic lesions. This chapter discusses the technical considerations for identifying and treating cases that might benefit from cardiac tumor obstruction interventions. All patients should receive a full physical examination and medical work-up prior to performing cardiac interventions. When performing anesthesia, intravenous catheter placement should take into consideration the location of the obstruction. Transatrial stenting from the inferior vena cava to the superior vena cava has been described for short-term management of ascites in two humans for intracardiac HCC extension. Heart base tumors such as chemodectomas can cause pulmonary artery compression leading to increased vascular resistance; a pulmonary artery stent has been placed in such situations resulting in reduced gradients.

AB  - This paper presents the evidence for a standard of care for psychosocial assessment in pediatric cancer. An interdisciplinary group of investigators utilized EBSCO, PubMed, PsycINFO, Ovid, and Google Scholar search databases, focusing on five areas: youth/family psychosocial adjustment, family resources, family/social support, previous history/premorbid functioning, and family structure/function. Descriptive quantitative studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses (n?=?149) were reviewed and evaluated using grading of recommendations, assessment development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. There is high quality evidence to support a strong recommendation for multifaceted, systematic assessments of psychosocial health care needs of youth with cancer and their families as a standard of care in pediatric oncology.

AB  - Summary Injuries to the head are common and can result in a significant loss of function if a vital structure is involved. The head is highly prominent, so cosmetic repair of a wound to the head is often important esthetically and may help retain the horse's resale value. Injuries to the head generally heal well, but the repair of such injuries requires skilled treatment to obtain optimal results. Meticulous attention to repair is necessary when repairing a laceration of a lip, eyelid, or nostril because proper function of these highly mobile structures is important. Although injuries to ears are not common, restoring the cosmetic appearance and function of an injured ear is challenging. Facial and orbital fractures are usually depressed, creating a conspicuous deformity, but they generally can be reconstructed successfully. Nasocutaneous and sinocutaneous fistulas have significant functional and cosmetic implications and can be very challenging to repair, especially if large.

AB  - Summary The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) includes a group of rare genodermatoses characterized by mutational impairment of the structural and functional integrity of intraepidermal adhesion and dermoepidermal anchorage. Clinically, these disorders are marked by increased skin fragility as well as characteristic mechanically inducible blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Extracutaneous manifestations and their complications in other epithelialized organs render EB a multi-system disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cornerstones of a dynamically changing healthcare structure include precise and early diagnosis; coordinated, multidisciplinary, individually adjusted patient care at specialized centers; optimized symptomatic therapies; and access to research-based, potentially curative therapeutic strategies.
