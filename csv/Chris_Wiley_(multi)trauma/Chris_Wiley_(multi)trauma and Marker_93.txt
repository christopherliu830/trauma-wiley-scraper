AB  - Summary Correct pulpal diagnosis is the key to all endodontic treatments. It is paramount to have established a clinical diagnosis of the pulp and the periapical tissue prior cutting access into the pulp chamber or to do any other treatment to a tooth. Clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests in addition to a comprehensive knowledge of the reaction of the pulp to caries, operative manipulations, trauma, and periodontal disease, enable us to establish an empirical pulp diagnosis only. The history of symptoms for the diagnosis of reversible pulpitis will mainly reveal provoked pain or sensation, and the tooth will only bother the patient when the tooth is exposed to a hot and/or cold or other excitatory stimuli. Like pulpal inflammation, the periapical inflammation can be symptom-free and only diagnosed in a chronic phase on a periapical radiograph. Determining the endodontic diagnosis prior to any invasive endodontic, or even any dental, procedure is paramount.

AB  - Summary The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) includes a group of rare genodermatoses characterized by mutational impairment of the structural and functional integrity of intraepidermal adhesion and dermoepidermal anchorage. Clinically, these disorders are marked by increased skin fragility as well as characteristic mechanically inducible blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Extracutaneous manifestations and their complications in other epithelialized organs render EB a multi-system disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cornerstones of a dynamically changing healthcare structure include precise and early diagnosis; coordinated, multidisciplinary, individually adjusted patient care at specialized centers; optimized symptomatic therapies; and access to research-based, potentially curative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - This paper presents the evidence for a standard of care for psychosocial assessment in pediatric cancer. An interdisciplinary group of investigators utilized EBSCO, PubMed, PsycINFO, Ovid, and Google Scholar search databases, focusing on five areas: youth/family psychosocial adjustment, family resources, family/social support, previous history/premorbid functioning, and family structure/function. Descriptive quantitative studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses (n?=?149) were reviewed and evaluated using grading of recommendations, assessment development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. There is high quality evidence to support a strong recommendation for multifaceted, systematic assessments of psychosocial health care needs of youth with cancer and their families as a standard of care in pediatric oncology.

AB  - Abstract HFE-hemochromatosis is a disease characterized by a systemic iron overload phenotype mainly associated with mutations in the HFE protein (HFE) gene. Osteoarthritis (OA) has been reported as one of the most prevalent complications in HFE-hemochromatosis patients, but the mechanisms associated with its onset and progression remain incompletely understood. In this study, we have characterized the response to high iron concentrations of a primary culture of articular chondrocytes isolated from newborn Hfe-KO mice and compared the results with that of a similar experiment developed in cells from C57BL/6 wild-type (wt) mice. Our data provide evidence that both wt- and Hfe-KO-derived chondrocytes, when exposed to 50??M iron, develop characteristics of an OA-related phenotype, such as an increased expression of metalloproteases, a decreased extracellular matrix production, and a lower expression level of aggrecan. In addition, Hfe-KO cells also showed an increased expression of iron metabolism markers and MMP3, indicating an increased susceptibility to intracellular iron accumulation and higher levels of chondrocyte catabolism. Accordingly, upon treatment with 50??M iron, these chondrocytes were found to preferentially differentiate toward hypertrophy with increased expression of collagen I and transferrin and downregulation of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box containing gene 9 (Sox9). In conclusion, high iron exposure can compromise chondrocyte metabolism, which, when simultaneously affected by an Hfe loss of function, appears to be more susceptible to the establishment of an OA-related phenotype.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents information on etiology/pathophysiology, signalment/history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnostics and therapeutics of feline pancreatitis in cats and dogs. Local and systemic tissue injury is due to the activity of released pancreatic enzymes and a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins, free radicals, and complement factors, released by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The most common pathologies involving the feline pancreas include acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and acute suppurative pancreatitis. Etiology is most often unknown. Serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPL) is a highly sensitive and specific serologic marker of acute pancreatic inflammation. fPL assay and pancreatic ultrasound in combination have the highest specificity for an antemortem diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy may confirm inflammation (cytology), abscess, or cygst.

AB  - Objective To determine the risk of bacterial growth in single use 50% dextrose vials punctured multiple times and stored in various hospital environments. Materials and Methods Three groups of three 50% dextrose vials were stored in our hospital intensive care unit at either ambient light or in a darkened drawer at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C. One vial in each group was punctured either once, once weekly or once daily for 28?days and samples taken for bacterial culture every 7 days until completion of the project. A fourth group of three vials were inoculated with several species of bacteria and stored in our microbiology laboratory under the environmental conditions described above with cultures performed every 7 days for 28?days. In addition, the water activity of 50% dextrose was determined using commercial laboratory equipment. Results Scant growth of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter agglomerans was detected in cultures performed on day 7, but not subsequent time points, from the inoculated refrigerated vials. The vial punctured once daily for 28?days and stored under refrigerated conditions showed growth of Bacillus subtilis on day 28. All remaining bottles had no bacterial growth at any time point or environmental condition. The water activity of 50% dextrose was 093 at 24°C and 092 at 4°C. Clinical Significance Bacterial growth in 50% dextrose vials was uncommon even when inoculated with pathogens. Bacterial growth only occurred in refrigerated storage conditions. The water activity of 50% dextrose is not low enough to inhibit all bacterial and fungal growth.

AB  - Summary Equine chronic progressive lymphoedema (CPL) is a disabling disorder of draught horse breeds. Combined decongestive therapy (CDT) is the treatment of choice for lymphoedema in man and has been adapted for use in horses. Equine CDT, which includes manual lymph drainage (MLD) and subsequent bandaging with short stretch bandages, was expected to improve the signs of CPL in draught horses because CPL resembles primary lymphoedema in man. Five affected horses - Gypsy cob (n?=?1), Clydesdale (n?=?1), Shires (n?=?3) - were included. Lesions were documented pre- and post treatment. Percentage volume loss of the distal legs was calculated using the disc model. Initial plans for daily CDT had to be adapted; intermittent treatment of Chorioptes infections required alternating between CDT and MLD in 4/5 horses. Concurrent pyoderma (1/5 horses) was treated throughout the study. Development of unrelated lameness (hoof abscess) allowed limited CDT treatment only in one horse. Marked softening of previously firm tissue indicated the change from ?brawny? to pitting oedema in 2/5 horses. Fibrotic nodules and folds in the pasterns became markedly softened and smaller in 2/5 horses. Skin surface notably improved in all horses: hyperkeratosis decreased, erosions and ulcerations healed completely and crusts disappeared. After 2 weeks, a mean volume reduction of 11.25% was seen, ranging from 4.75?21.74% and quality of movement improved. This pilot study documents evidence that CDT assists management of CPL. Current CPL management is limited to palliative treatments of secondary infections. Whilst not a permanent treatment, CDT offers a promising tool to manage horses with CPL, improving their quality of life and potential usefulness. More extensive and prolonged studies with a larger number of horses are warranted to evaluate the full potential of CDT.

AB  - Abstract Aims To test, among Chinese adolescents: (1) whether childhood maltreatment is associated with non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) and (2) whether there are interaction effects of childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms on NMUPD. Design A secondary analysis of the cross-sectional data collected from 7th- and 12th-graders who were sampled using a multi-stage, stratified-cluster, random-sampling method in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey (SCAHS). Setting Surveys conducted in high schools in six cities of China in 2015. Participants There were 24?457 students who were invited to participate and 23?039 students? questionnaires were completed and qualified for our survey. Measurements The outcomes comprised self-report of NMUPD (prior 30 days); a history of childhood maltreatment was our main predictor. Other covariates included depressive symptoms, smoking, drinking and demographics. Data were analysed using multi-level regression modelling. Findings Our final multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that after adjusting for other variables, physical abuse was associated positively with non-medical use of opioids [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10?1.22], sedatives (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.10?1.21) and any prescription drugs (AOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.09?1.20); emotional abuse, sexual abuse and emotional neglect were also associated with an increased risk of opioids, sedatives and any prescription drugs misuse; students who reported that they had experienced childhood physical neglect were more likely to be involved in the non-medical use of sedatives (AOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04?1.12) and any prescription drugs (AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03?1.10). Additionally, there was no evidence of interaction effects on NMUPD between depressive symptoms and each of physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect, respectively. Conclusions Maltreatment while a child is associated with an increased risk of non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) among Chinese adolescents. The interactions of maltreatment while a child and depressive symptoms do not appear to be associated significantly with NMUPD among Chinese adolescents.

AB  - Abstract Atherosclerotic vascular disease not only remains the leading cause of death in the Western countries, but it has become the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the low- and middle-income countries as well. Therefore, better understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and its prevention are of fundamental importance. It is well known that it affects sequentially the aorta followed by coronary, carotid, peripheral, and intracerebral arteries, with some individual variability. The mechanisms of progression are similar in each of the beds, with increasing lipid accumulation in the arterial wall along with macrophages and T-cell infiltration, paucity of smooth-muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition, and endothelial-cell dysfunction and hypercoagulability playing an important role at the time of acute manifestations of the disease. Fundamental to this inflammatory process is the presence of classic risk factors, regardless of the involved territory. Therefore, the concept of palliative treatment must be reserved for only those who have progressed beyond preventive measures. Mt Sinai J Med 79:641?653, 2012. ? 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - Macaque species, specifically rhesus (Macaca mulatta), are the most common nonhuman primates (NHPs) used in biomedical research due to their suitability as a model of high priority diseases (e.g., HIV, obesity, cognitive aging), cost effective breeding and housing compared to most other NHPs, and close evolutionary relationship to humans. With this close evolutionary relationship, however, is a shared adaptation for a socially stimulating environment, without which both their welfare and suitability as a research model are compromised. While outdoor social group housing provides the best approximation of a social environment that matches the macaque behavioral biology in the wild, this is not always possible at all facilities, where animals may be housed indoors in small groups, in pairs, or alone. Further, animals may experience many housing changes in their lifetime depending on project needs, changes in social status, management needs, or health concerns. Here, we review the evidence for the physiological and health effects of social housing changes and the potential impacts on research outcomes for studies using macaques, particularly rhesus. We situate our review in the context of increasing regulatory pressure for research facilities to both house NHPs socially and mitigate trauma from social aggression. To meet these regulatory requirements and further refine the macaque model for research, significant advances must be made in our understanding and management of rhesus macaque social housing, particularly pair-housing since it is the most common social housing configuration for macaques while on research projects. Because most NHPs are adapted for sociality, a social context is likely important for improving repeatability, reproducibility, and external validity of primate biomedical research. Am. J.

AB  - An 81 yo male presented with several asymptomatic firm 1?5?cm red purple plaques on the trunk and lower extremities associated with a mild pancytopenia. Histological examination revealed a diffuse, monotonous dermal infiltrate of atypical medium sized cells with fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated positivity for CD 45, CD43, CD4, Bcl-2, and TdT; but was negative for cytokeratin, melan-A, CD30 and hematopoietic lineage specific markers. A subsequent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a dense population of cells that were morphologically consistent with blasts. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed lesional cells that expressed CD56, CD4, CD7, CD5, HLA-DR and TdT. However, lineage specific markers for B-cells (CD19, CD20, cCD79a, and CD10), T-cells (sCD3 and cCD3), and myeloid cells (CD13, CD33, CD117, cCD13, CD14, CD41, CD61, myeloperoxidase, and alpha napthyl butyrate esterase) were not expressed. Molecular studies by PCR exhibited no evidence of T-cell receptor or heavy chain gene rearrangements. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a primary cutaneous blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphomas are characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous involvement and an aggressive clinical course. Our patient responded dramatically to one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy with resolution of his cutaneous tumors.

AB  - Abstract Inherent recipient factors, including pretransplant diagnosis, obesity and elevated pulmonary pressures, are established primary graft dysfunction (PGD) risks. We evaluated the relationship between preoperative lung injury biomarkers and PGD to gain further mechanistic insight in recipients. We performed a prospective cohort study of recipients in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group enrolled between 2002 and 2010. Our primary outcome was Grade 3 PGD on Day 2 or 3. We measured preoperative plasma levels of five biomarkers (CC-16, sRAGE, ICAM-1, IL-8 and Protein C) that were previously associated with PGD when measured at the postoperative time point. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Of 714 subjects, 130 (18%) developed PGD. Median CC-16 levels were elevated in subjects with PGD (10.1 vs. 6.0, p?<?0.001). CC-16 was associated with PGD in nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) subjects (OR for highest quartile of CC-16: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.37, 6.00, p?=?0.005) but not in subjects with IPF (OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.43, 4.45, p?=?0.59). After adjustment, preoperative CC-16 levels remained associated with PGD (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 7.30, p?=?0.013) in non-IPF subjects. Our study suggests the importance of preexisting airway epithelial injury in PGD. Markers of airway epithelial injury may be helpful in pretransplant risk stratification in specific recipients.

AB  - Abstract Heart transplantation is a well-established therapy for end-stage heart failure in children and young adults. The highest risk of graft loss occurs in the first 60 days post-transplant. Donor fraction of cell-free DNA is a highly sensitive marker of graft injury. Changes in cell-free DNA levels have not previously been studied in depth in patients early after heart transplant. A prospective study was conducted among heart transplant recipients at a single pediatric heart center. Blood samples were collected from children and young adult transplant patients at three time points within 10 days of transplantation. DF and total cell-free DNA levels were measured using a targeted method (myTAIHEART). In 17 patients with serial post-transplant samples, DF peaks in the first 2 days after transplant (3.5%, [1.9-10]%) and then declines toward baseline (0.27%, [0.19-0.52]%) by 6-9 days. There were 4 deaths in the first year among the 10 patients with complete sample sets, and 3 out of 4 who died had a late rise or blunted decline in donor fraction. Patients who died trended toward an elevated total cell-free DNA at 1 week (41.5, [34-65] vs 13.6, [6.2-22] P = .07). Donor fraction peaks early after heart transplant and then declines toward baseline. Patients without sustained decline in donor fraction and/or elevated total cell-free DNA at 1 week may have worse outcomes.

AB  - Objectives. The claim that topics in children's drawings convey the children's emotional attitude towards those topics was investigated. Design. The influence of an emotional topic (neutral man, friendly and enemy soldier) and trauma group (child with father or father killed in war) was examined on the size of the topics and their placement relative to a self-portrait drawing. Methods. Sixty Croatian children drew a man, followed on a separate page by either (a) a Croatian soldier, (b) an enemy soldier or (c) a second drawing of a man. The child's self-portrait drawing was placed on each page. Results. There were no significant main or interaction effects on size or placement of topic. Conclusions. There are unlikely to be reliable features of drawings that portray the child's emotional attitude towards the topic drawn.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cell disorders are uncommon but a subset of these disorders, especially mastocytoma, can histologically mimic leukemia cutis. Our objective was to employ a panel of cytochemical and immunohistolochemical markers to determine which markers would be most useful in distinguishing these entities. We studied 17 cases of cutaneous mast cell disorders (UP, TMEP, and mastocytoma) and 12 cases of leukemia cutis (myeloid, myelomonocytic and monocytic) with toluidine blue, Giemsa, pinacyanol erythrocyanate (PE), mast cell tryptase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), CD117, myeloperoxidase, CD43 and CD68. We found that PE stained the majority of cases of mast cell disorders (11/15) but did not stain leukemia cutis. Tryptase and MITF stained all cases of mast cell disorders but not leukemia cutis. Although CD117 showed strong staining in all cases of mast cell disorders, it also stained up to 25% of cases of leukemia cutis (2/8). Staining for myeloperoxidase was specific to leukemia cutis but detected only leukemias with myeloid differentiation (6/12). Our results show that mast cell tryptase and microphthalmia transcription factor are equally effective in distinguishing mast cell disorders from leukemia cutis. Interestingly, pinacyanol erythrocyanate appears to be specific for mast cell disease, as no staining was seen in leukemia cutis.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the airway and perioperative management. Beta Blockers have potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. In addition to helping prevent/control arrhythmias, beta blockade also helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand that is produced by catecholamine release during stress periods. The most widely accepted theory of the continuation of statin therapy in the perioperative period is due to plaque stabilization. This is thought to occur secondary to the reduction of thrombin-induced expression and lipopolysaccharide induced expression of tissue factor. Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy can be performed by patient history and physical examination. The mnemonic ?SMART? is a tool that can used to assess for difficulties that may occur: S: Surgery; M: Mass; A: Access or Anatomy; R: Radiation; and T: Tumor. Clinicians should be aware of identifiable factors in patients with difficult airways as these can dictate outcomes.
