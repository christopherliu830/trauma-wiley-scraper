AB  - Summary The normal vertebral artery (VA) can be divided into four segments: the V1 or extraosseous segment; the V2 or foraminal segment; the V3 or extraspinal segment; and the V4 or intradural segment. There are various carotid-vertebral and carotid basilar anastomoses which develop from the persistence of primitive arteries arising from dorsal extensions of the early internal carotid artery (ICA). Embolism is the most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia, and vertebral artery stenosis is the second most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia. Dissection of the vertebral artery occurs most frequently at the level of the second and third cervical vertebrae. Dissection events occur more frequently in patients who may have fibromuscular disease, a family history, and patients with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vertebral artery dissection is most frequently related to either spontaneous dissection or external trauma. Most vertebral intervention is now being done with an entirely endovascular approach.

AB  - Abstract Heart transplantation is a well-established therapy for end-stage heart failure in children and young adults. The highest risk of graft loss occurs in the first 60 days post-transplant. Donor fraction of cell-free DNA is a highly sensitive marker of graft injury. Changes in cell-free DNA levels have not previously been studied in depth in patients early after heart transplant. A prospective study was conducted among heart transplant recipients at a single pediatric heart center. Blood samples were collected from children and young adult transplant patients at three time points within 10 days of transplantation. DF and total cell-free DNA levels were measured using a targeted method (myTAIHEART). In 17 patients with serial post-transplant samples, DF peaks in the first 2 days after transplant (3.5%, [1.9-10]%) and then declines toward baseline (0.27%, [0.19-0.52]%) by 6-9 days. There were 4 deaths in the first year among the 10 patients with complete sample sets, and 3 out of 4 who died had a late rise or blunted decline in donor fraction. Patients who died trended toward an elevated total cell-free DNA at 1 week (41.5, [34-65] vs 13.6, [6.2-22] P = .07). Donor fraction peaks early after heart transplant and then declines toward baseline. Patients without sustained decline in donor fraction and/or elevated total cell-free DNA at 1 week may have worse outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Oligodendroglial reactions to compression injury of spinal cord include apoptosis, secondary demyelination, and remyelination failure. Within hours after contusion, the membrane lipid peroxidation (MLP) byproduct, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), increases rapidly in gray matter and thereafter in white matter tracts beyond the initial lesion level. Considering that HNE is a mediator and marker of neuronal MLP toxicity in various neurodegenerative conditions, the present study examined its effect on the regeneration potential of oligodendrocyte progenitors, as defined by their capacity to survive, proliferate and migrate in primary culture. Treatment of oligodendroblasts with HNE evoked a time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity resembling apoptosis at aldehyde concentrations known to be produced by neurons and achieved in tissue undergoing peroxidative injury. In addition, sublethal concentrations of HNE inhibited the mitogenic and chemotactic responses of more immature progenitors to platelet-derived growth factor. These effects appear to be mediated in part by the formation of HNE adducts with progenitor proteins located within the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic compartments. Our data are the first to show that HNE can have direct, deleterious effects on oligodendrocyte precursors. The present study also suggests a mechanism by which the striking accumulation of HNE in white matter tracts surrounding the site of spinal cord compression injury and in other ischemic-hypoxic insults associated with MLP could suppress the potential regenerative response of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cell disorders are uncommon but a subset of these disorders, especially mastocytoma, can histologically mimic leukemia cutis. Our objective was to employ a panel of cytochemical and immunohistolochemical markers to determine which markers would be most useful in distinguishing these entities. We studied 17 cases of cutaneous mast cell disorders (UP, TMEP, and mastocytoma) and 12 cases of leukemia cutis (myeloid, myelomonocytic and monocytic) with toluidine blue, Giemsa, pinacyanol erythrocyanate (PE), mast cell tryptase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), CD117, myeloperoxidase, CD43 and CD68. We found that PE stained the majority of cases of mast cell disorders (11/15) but did not stain leukemia cutis. Tryptase and MITF stained all cases of mast cell disorders but not leukemia cutis. Although CD117 showed strong staining in all cases of mast cell disorders, it also stained up to 25% of cases of leukemia cutis (2/8). Staining for myeloperoxidase was specific to leukemia cutis but detected only leukemias with myeloid differentiation (6/12). Our results show that mast cell tryptase and microphthalmia transcription factor are equally effective in distinguishing mast cell disorders from leukemia cutis. Interestingly, pinacyanol erythrocyanate appears to be specific for mast cell disease, as no staining was seen in leukemia cutis.

AB  - Summary Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise to provide important new therapeutic approaches in treating age-associated diseases and other medical conditions due to their unique capacity for self-renewal, their pluripotency and their ability to differentiate into a broad variety of cell types. To date, numerous hESC lines have been developed and characterised. We discuss here how hESC lines are derived, their molecular and cellular properties, and how their ability to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers is determined. We highlight some of the challenges that must be overcome to obtain and evaluate therapeutic populations from hESCs and the strategies that are being developed to enable the use of hESC-derived cell populations in clinical applications. We conclude with a discussion of clinical trials that are beginning to provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of tissue-specific differentiated populations derived from human embryonic stem cells.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.

AB  - Survivors of ritual abuse have endured physical and psychosexual trauma typically compounded by mind-altering drugs. Some abused children have never known a trustworthy adult to protect them from harm. Children often cope with the anxiety and terror of abuse through psychological defenses such as denial, self-hypnosis, and dissociation, but more extreme responses such as self-mutilation or multiple personalities may occur. Reports of ritual abuse of children are so shocking and bizarre that professionals initially respond with confusion and disbelief (Cozolino, 1989). Nurses need to assess clues and detect symbols of abuse in drawings or flashbacks, to build trust, and to monitor their attitudes and countertransference. Nurses are in a critical position to detect and begin healing wounds of ritual abuse.

AB  - Resilience offers the promise of a paradigm shift in many fields of research, clinical practice, and policy. A lens on resilience shifts the focus of attention ? from concerted efforts to appraise risk or vulnerability, towards concerted efforts to enhance strength or capability. It also shifts the focus of analysis ? from asking relatively limited questions regarding health outcomes, such as what are the linkages between risk exposures and functional deficits, to asking more complex questions regarding wellbeing, such as when, how, why and for whom do resources truly matter. Thus we might ask when interventions are most effective, within the time frame of human development and evolutionary life history; and how do we best measure pathways of human experience, to uncover ways in which individuals and communities withstand adversity.To many, resilience is an intuitive, albeit opaque, concept ? akin to fortitude in the face of adversity. We may have an intuitive grasp of what resilience means, but fall short of measuring it comprehensively and meaningfully (the same is true of risk). This Annual Research Review issue features ten articles from leaders in the field on how resilience can transform the field of child development. Each articulates important lessons on resilience some of which we editors wish to summarize at the outset. First, resilience is best understood as a process that unfolds over the course of development; consequently, we seek to understand human experience of adversity as pathways of risk and resilience. Second, research on resilience focuses attention on the biological and social trade-offs in human experience: issues of timing, process, and context to understand change or adaptability.

AB  - Differential DNA methylation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related gene FKBP5 has recently been shown to be associated with varying response to environmental influences and may play a role in how well people respond to psychological treatments. Participants (n?=?111) received exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, or specific phobias. Percentage DNA methylation levels were measured for the promoter region and intron 7 of FKBP5. The association between percentage reduction in clinical severity and change in DNA methylation was tested using linear mixed models. The effect of genotype (rs1360780) was tested by the inclusion of an interaction term. The association between change in DNA methylation and FKBP5 expression was examined. Change in percentage DNA methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 was associated with percentage reduction in severity (??=??4.26, p?=?3.90 ? 10?4), where a decrease in DNA methylation was associated with greater response to therapy. An interaction was detected between rs1360780 and changes in DNA methylation in the promoter region of FKBP5 on treatment outcome (p?=?.045) but did not survive correction for multiple testing. Changes in DNA methylation were not associated with FKBP5 expression. Decreasing DNA methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 of FKBP5 was strongly associated with decreasing anxiety severity following exposure-based CBT. In addition, there was suggestive evidence that allele-specific methylation at the promoter region may also be associated with treatment response. The results of this study add to the growing literature demonstrating the role of biological processes such as DNA methylation in response to environmental influences.

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Animals Client-owned cats (n?=?17) with MHE. Methods Cats diagnosed with MHE, based on clinical signs, radiographs and computed tomography (CT), were prospectively recruited. Cats were treated conservatively for an initial 4 weeks, followed by either surgery or continued conservative treatment. Followup examinations were performed at 6 and 12 weeks and at 6?49 months. Results Cats had a mean age of 10.3 years and presented for chronic lameness. Examination revealed pain on palpation caudodistal to the medial epicondyle and by exerting antebrachial supination/pronation with elbow and carpal flexion. Lameness was restricted to 1 limb although CT revealed bilateral disease in 11/17 cats. Free mineralized joint bodies were identified in 9/17 cats. Nine cats were treated surgically and 8 cats were treated conservatively. Intraoperative findings included new bone formation at the origin of the humeral head of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle with displacement and adhesions of the ulnar nerve. Microscopic examination revealed neurogenic myopathy in 4/9 cats treated surgically. Seven of 9 cats treated surgically were free from lameness by 12 weeks. Seven of 8 cats treated conservatively were chronically lame throughout the study. Conclusions Cats with forelimb lameness should be evaluated for MHE. This condition is associated with free joint bodies and neurogenic myopathy. Surgical treatment is associated with excellent outcome in the majority of cats.

AB  - Abstract Aims To compare individuals with comorbid life-time post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders [AUD; i.e. no drug use disorders (DUD)] with those with comorbid PTSD and DUD on past-year prevalence of these disorders, social functioning, life-time psychiatric comorbidities, and treatment receipt. The comorbid groups were also compared with their single diagnosis counterparts. Design and Setting Cross-sectional cohort study using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III). Participants The total sample size was 36?309. Six groups were established: PTSD/AUD, PTSD/DUD, AUD, DUD, PTSD, and neither PTSD nor AUD/DUD. Life-time prevalence of AUD among those with PTSD/DUD was 80.2% and among those with DUD was 73.8%. Measurements The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-5 version assessed life-time and past-year psychiatric disorders and treatment receipt. Demographics and social stability indicators were queried. Group characteristics were summarized using weighted means. Prevalences and estimates for adjusted differences in means and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were derived from multiple linear regression and logistic regression models, respectively. Analyses were conducted in R and accounted for the NESARC-III's complex survey design, clustering, and non-response. Findings Compared with those with life-time PTSD/AUD, those with life-time PTSD/DUD were significantly less likely to have neither disorder in the past year (PTSD/AUD = 16.1%; PTSD/DUD = 8.5%; aOR = 0.54), and were more likely to report worse social and psychiatric functioning, and to have received both addiction and mental health treatment (PTSD/AUD = 18.4%; PTSD/DUD = 43.2%; aOR = 3.88). Compared with their single disorder counterparts, those with PTSD/DUD reported greater impairment than both groups, whereas the comorbid PTSD/AUD group differed more from the AUD than the PTSD group. Conclusions People with comorbid PTSD and drug use disorder have greater social and psychiatric impairment and may require different types and intensity of intervention than people with comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder.

AB  - Abstract: In toxicology studies, drug-induced arterial injury in laboratory animals continues to be a pressing issue of concern, particularly to those engaged in the discovery and development of novel therapies intended for human use. The concern is justifiably magnified because, currently, there is no unequivocal biochemical marker of arterial injury and/or toxicity in animals or man. Therefore, in laboratory animals used for toxicology studies a precise description of arterial lesions in terms of location, distribution and morphologic character is necessary so that a correlation can be drawn between structural damage and derangement of specific cardiovascular functions. The critical nature of the latter cannot be over-emphasized because this will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of toxicity, the pathogenesis of the lesion and assessment of human risk. However, in the decision making process, utilization of pattern recognition must be supported by rigorous scientific investigations aimed at establishing a link, where possible, between the deranged cardiovascular function and alterations in cellular, biochemical and molecular events. Conceivably, engagement of the molecular pharmacology target initiates a series of interactive cascades among cellular and non-cellular arterial components that culminate in organ damage. Therefore, any investigative mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the initiation and development of arterial lesions in laboratory animals must make a conscientious attempt to identify and characterize the molecular target of toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Aging is characterized by accumulation of structural and metabolic changes in the brain. Recent studies suggest transmodal brain networks are especially sensitive to aging, which, we hypothesize, may be due to their apical position in the cortical hierarchy. Studying an open-access healthy cohort (n = 102, age range = 30?89?years) with MRI and A? PET data, we estimated age-related cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and A? deposition. In addition to carrying out surface-based morphological and metabolic mapping experiments, we stratified effects along neocortical and hippocampal resting-state functional connectome gradients derived from independent datasets. The cortical gradient depicts an axis of functional differentiation from sensory-motor regions to transmodal regions, whereas the hippocampal gradient recapitulates its long-axis. While age-related thinning and increased A? deposition occurred across the entire cortical topography, increased A? deposition was especially pronounced toward higher-order transmodal regions. Age-related atrophy was greater toward the posterior end of the hippocampal long-axis. No significant effect of age on A? deposition in the hippocampus was observed. Imaging markers correlated with behavioral measures of fluid intelligence and episodic memory in a topography-specific manner, confirmed using both univariate as well as multivariate analyses. Our results strengthen existing evidence of structural and metabolic change in the aging brain and support the use of connectivity gradients as a compact framework to analyze and conceptualize brain-based biomarkers of aging.
