AB  - Summary One of the most common events in equine practice is the presentation of a trauma resulting in skin and soft-tissue wounds. The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Summary Persons with diabetes require surgical procedures at a higher rate and have longer hospital stays than those without diabetes. Approximately 5% of persons with diabetes will require emergency surgery over their lifetime. The actual perioperative glycemic treatment recommendations for a given patient should be individualized, based on factors such as current glycemic control, type of diabetes, nature and extent of surgical procedure, and antecedent diabetes therapy. The management goal is to optimize metabolic control through close monitoring, adequate fluid and caloric repletion, and judicious use of insulin. Other endocrine and metabolic derangements (e.g., adrenal insufficiency; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism; carcinoid crisis; hyponatremia; and hypercalcemia) are also common in the emergency perioperative setting and warrant prompt review and management.

AB  - SUMMARY Patients with esophageal cancer may present with dysphagia and weight loss. Resectable lesions require consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which improves survival but have side effects, which compound already poor intake. Prevention of malnutrition has historically required interventions such as surgical jejunostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, which carry associated morbidity. With established roles in palliation, self-expanding removable metal stents (SERMS) may provide an alternative intervention in resectable disease. We sought to evaluate outcomes from our unit's introduction of SERMS in dysphagic patients prior to esophagectomy. All dysphagic patients presenting with esophageal cancer and considered for curative surgery between April 2006 and November 2008 were offered preoperative treatment of dysphagia with SERMS during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Baseline and preoperative outcomes assessed included dysphagia score and nutritional markers. Sixteen patients underwent esophageal stenting during neoadjuvant therapy of whom 7/16 (44%) were female with mean age 63 (53?76). In 12/16 (75%), tumors were located in the lower one third of the esophagus. There was a significant fall in mean dysphagia score from 2.5 (range 1?4) to 1.1 (range 0?3) immediately preoperatively. There was no significant change in serum albumin, weight, or body mass index. Stent-related morbidity occurred in 4/16 (25%) patients and stomach migration occurred in 7/16 (43.8%). All were resolved endoscopically and there was no stent-related mortality. Of 10/16 (62.5%) patients ultimately progressing to esophagectomy, 30-day mortality was 6.3%. Anastomotic leak occurred in one patient (10%) and R1 resection rate was 20%. SERMS are a safe and effective intervention in dysphagic patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancer. Complications are minor and readily treatable with endoscopy. Objective parameters suggest nutritional status is maintained and symptoms are improved. SERMS do not appear to compromise resection.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a robust, non-invasive means of defining aspects of human neurochemistry. After more than two decades, it is clear that in addition to its scientific interest, MRS has diagnostic value in tumor diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic outcome, dementia diagnosis and prognosis, multiple sclerosis, infections, trauma, development, stroke, perinatal ischemia, xenobiotics and inborn errors (as determined from a meta-analysis included in this paper). However, in many healthcare systems, a new radiological technique requires evidence-based medicine (EBM) before it is recommended for reimbursement. Much of the reason why MRS is thought to be non-reimbursable in the USA is due to recent announcements that this 15-year-old technique is still considered ?investigational? by these EBM assessments. An analysis is presented of the technology assessments that brought about this situation. Based on the conclusions of the EBM assessments, strategies are suggested that involve all entities responsible for spectroscopy including the scientists' role in ensuring the future for clinical spectroscopy.

AB  - Abstract This review paper explores the productive potential of walking methods in post-conflict space, with particular emphasis on Northern Ireland. We argue that walking methods are especially well suited to studying post-conflict spatial arrangements, yet remain under-utilised for a variety of reasons. Specifically, we argue that walking methods can ?trouble? dominant productions of post-conflict space, revealing its storied depth, multi-temporality, and the alternative narratives of the past that frequently remain hidden in places touched by violence. Critically, employing such place-sensitive approaches challenges ?bad scripts? that reify polarised narratives of conflicted places, thereby enabling the writing of new spatial stories that are potentially generative of new research questions and scholarly insights rooted in overlooked, marginalised, or taken-for-granted people, places, and landscapes. Informed by both authors ongoing research journeys, we argue that walking in troubled places can help scholars dig into the reservoirs of emotion, affect, vitality, and multi-temporality people experience in post-conflict landscapes, thus opening up new research vistas in places scholars might not have sought to look using only sedentary methods.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and other cognitive functions in the elderly. The social and financial impacts of AD are overwhelming and are escalating exponentially as a result of population aging. Therefore, identifying AD-related risk factors and the development of more efficacious therapeutic approaches are critical to cure this neurological disorder. Current epidemiological evidence indicates that life experiences, including chronic stress, are a risk for AD. However, it is unknown if short-term stress, lasting for hours, influences the onset or progression of AD. Here, we determined the effect of short-term, multi-modal ?modern life-like? stress on AD pathogenesis and synaptic plasticity in mice bearing three AD mutations (the 3xTg-AD mouse model). We found that combined emotional and physical stress lasting 5 h severely impaired memory in wild-type mice and tended to impact it in already low-performing 3xTg-AD mice. This stress reduced the number of synapse-bearing dendritic spines in 3xTg-AD mice and increased A? levels by augmenting A?PP processing. Thus, short-term stress simulating modern-life conditions may exacerbate cognitive deficits in preclinical AD by accelerating amyloid pathology and reducing synapse numbers.

AB  - Abstract Aims Knowledge of the distribution of the innervation zones (IZs) of the external anal sphincter (EAS) may be useful for preventing anal sphincter incompetence during vaginal delivery. A method proposed for the automatic estimation of the distribution of IZs of EAS from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) was evaluated for repeatability in continent volunteers. Methods In 13 healthy female subjects (age: 35?±?11 years) surface EMG signals were acquired using an anal probe with three circumferential electrode arrays (of 16 contacts each) at different depths within the anal canal (15?mm distance between the centers of adjacent arrays), during four independent experimental sessions. Three maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of 10?sec were performed for each session for a total of 12 contractions per subject. Repeatability of the estimation of the distribution of IZ was tested by evaluating the coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) between the IZ distributions estimated from the signals recorded from each subject. Results A high repeatability (CMC?>?0.8) was found comparing IZ distributions estimated from signals recorded by each array within the same session. A slightly lower value was obtained considering signals recorded during different sessions (CMC?>?0.7), but a higher value (CMC?>?0.8) was obtained after aligning the estimated IZ distributions. The realignment compensates for the operator's error in repositioning the probe in the same position during different sessions. Conclusion This result justifies clinical studies using high-density surface EMG in routine examinations, providing information about IZs of EAS and assessing the possibilities of preventing neuronal trauma during vaginal delivery.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult with many patients treated without the disease or left untreated without an adequate diagnostic work up. Recent advances in PE diagnosis are reviewed. The use of risk stratification in PE diagnosis is strongly recommended and evidence on how it can best be performed summarized. The Ginsberg/Wells stratification rule is recommended currently as the best validated rule. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was found to have quite poor sensitivity and to be poorly validated. It is recommended as adequate as a positive test in moderate/high risk groups and an exclusionary test in low risk groups or where an adequate alternative diagnosis is found. For D-Dimer tests the only test with adequate sensitivity and validation in management studies is the VIDAS? D-Dimer. This is in low/intermediate risk groups in the ED population. The Simpli-Red? test is also reviewed but is too insensitive for most populations. Echocardiography: this is good in compromised patients as it is a bedside test which when negative virtually excludes PE. If positive in the right setting it has a high positive predictive value. A negative echocardiogram predicts a benign clinical course for PE. The rest of the paper details the authors approach to integrating these new techniques with established algorithms and where progress is likely to occur in the next few years. These include improvements in CTPA (plus the addition of CT venography), new point of care D-Dimer tests, better risk stratification rules and integration of new strategies with artificial neural networks or computerized guidelines.

AB  - EB is a recessive condition caused by a defect in collagen 7 production, such that epithelial cells do not adhere adequately to the underlying basement membranes. Minor mechanical trauma and stress forces will cause recurrent blistering of the skin and mucosal surfaces, which heal by scarring. The hand suffers particularly badly, and a characteristic mitten deformity of scar tissue is a common stigmata of the disease. We report a 51 year old survivor of EB with a bilateral mitten hand deformity that had been present since the age of 6 years. Extensive surgical release of the dominant left hand was undertaken, resurfacing the created defects with split skin grafts under regional anaesthesia. Fingers that had been buried for 45 years were straightened and held in place with k wires whilst the grafts were vascularising. Extensive post operative physiotherapy and splinting were undertaken, with functional improvement to the extent that the patient was able to hold a pen and write. Skin graft donor sites healed uneventfully. Extensive release of mitten hand deformity in long term survivors of EB is a worthwhile surgical procedure with good functional results. The problems of surgery and anaesthesia in this condition are discussed. Release of the second hand is planned.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury causes damage to ascending and descending tracts, as well as to local circuits, but relatively little is known about the effect of such injury on sensory neurons located within adjoining ganglia. We have therefore used immunocytochemistry for activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), a sensitive marker of axonal damage, in order to examine the effects of spinal cord injury in rats on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. A 50-g static compression injury applied to the dorsal surface of the T12 thoracic spinal cord led to an up-regulation of ATF3 that was maximal at 1?day and affected 12?14% of DRG neurons in ganglia caudal to the injury (T13?L3). A similar response was seen after a T12 hemisection that transected the dorsal columns except that compression injury, but not hemisection, also evoked ATF3 expression in ganglia just rostral to the injury (T10, T11). ATF3 was up-regulated exclusively in DRG neurons that were of large diameter and immunoreactive for heavy neurofilament. Small-diameter cells, including the population that binds the lectin Grifffonia simplicifolia IB4, did not express ATF3 immunoreactivity. A similar pattern of ATF3 expression was induced by dorsal rhizotomy. The data show for the first time that ATF3 is up-regulated after spinal cord and dorsal root injury, but that this up-regulation is confined to the large-diameter cell population.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of treating infrapopliteal lesions using a novel drug delivery catheter locally delivering liquid paclitaxel. Background Balloon angioplasty is currently the Gold Standard to treat below-the-knee disease; however, restenosis continues to be a great challenge following these percutaneous revascularization procedures. Methods The Occlusion Perfusion Catheter for Optimal Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Prevention of Endovascular Restenosis (COPPER-A) study?Below-the-Knee Cohort was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, feasibility, and safety study that enrolled 35 patients at 11 participating sites. The safety endpoints at 1, 3, and 6 months were freedom from thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. The efficacy endpoints were primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Thirty-five patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 112?±?81.2?mm with the lesion length range of 20?286?mm. At 6-month follow-up, primary patency was 89.3% and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.4%. No patients demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up intervals. Conclusions The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that infrapopliteal arteries can be safely and effectively treated with liquid paclitaxel using the occlusion perfusion catheter.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2010; 17:e110?e129 ? 2010 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Preface All of us who have worked on this curriculum are career emergency physicians (EPs) who have become leaders with a focus on emergency medicine (EM) quality and safety. About 2?years ago, I approached my colleagues of the American College of Emergency Physicians Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (ACEP QIPS) Section and dreamed an idea of creating an EM quality and safety curriculum: an outline that would explain a topic few EPs understand. That outline would be used as a curriculum to teach our EM residents (and even our attendings, physician?s assistants, and nurse leaders) about EM quality and safety. My goal is for this curriculum to become an integral part of every EM residency program and department. We know that quality and safety in patient care does not happen by accident. We must teach these concepts to everyone on our emergency department (ED) team. The safety of our patients depends on this. I would like to thank each of the authors who spent many months on this project, along with the ACEP QIPS Section and ACEP Quality and Performance Committee. Also, I would like to thank ACEP staff Angela Franklin and Idania Lorenti for their help in getting this project to completion. I must also sincerely acknowledge the early work and ideas generated by Drs. Shari Welch and David John: their contributions clearly helped shape this article. ?John J. Kelly, DO

AB  - Abstract What would abolitionism mean for climate justice? ?Resilience? is proposed by experts as a solution to climate change vulnerability. But this prescription tends to focus on adaptation to future external threats, subtly validating embedded processes of racial capitalism that have historically dehumanised and endangered residents and their environments in the first place. This article focuses on majority Black areas said to be vulnerable to extreme weather events and targeted for expert-driven resilience enhancements in America's capital city, Washington, DC. Drawing on key insights from Black radical, feminist, and antiracist humanist thought, we reimagine resilience through an abolitionist framework. Using archival analysis, oral histories, a neighbourhood-level survey, and interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018, we argue that abolitionist climate justice entails a centring of DC's historical environmental and housing-related racisms, the intersectional drivers of precarity and trauma experienced by residents beyond those narrowly associated with ?climate?; and an ethics of care and healing practiced by those deemed most at risk to climate change.
