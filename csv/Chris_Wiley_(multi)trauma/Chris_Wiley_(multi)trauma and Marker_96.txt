AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Background and Purpose Retinal neurodegeneration is an early and critical event in several diseases associated with blindness. Clinically, therapies that target neurodegeneration fail. We aimed to elucidate the multiple roles by which thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) contributes to initial and sustained retinal neurodegeneration. Experimental Approach Neurotoxicity was induced by intravitreal injection of NMDA into wild-type (WT) and TXNIP-knockout (TKO) mice. The expression of apoptotic and inflammatory markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry, elisa and Western blot. Microvascular degeneration was assessed by periodic acid-Schiff and haematoxylin staining and retinal function by electroretinogram. Key Results NMDA induced early (1 day) and significant retinal PARP activation, a threefold increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei and 40% neuronal loss in ganglion cell layer (GCL); and vascular permeability in WT but not TKO mice. NMDA induced glial activation, expression of TNF-α and IL-1? that co-localized with Müller cells in WT but not TKO mice. In parallel, NMDA triggered the expression of NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3), activation of caspase-1, and release of IL-1? and TNF-α in primary WT but not TKO Müller cultures. After 14 days, NMDA induced 1.9-fold microvascular degeneration, 60% neuronal loss in GCL and increased TUNEL-labelled cells in the GCL and inner nuclear layer in WT but not TKO mice. Electroretinogram analysis showed more significant reductions in b-wave amplitudes in WT than in TKO mice. Conclusion and Implications Targeting TXNIP expression prevented early retinal ganglion cell death, glial activation, retinal inflammation and secondary neuro/microvascular degeneration and preserved retinal function. TXNIP is a promising new therapeutic target for retinal neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury causes damage to ascending and descending tracts, as well as to local circuits, but relatively little is known about the effect of such injury on sensory neurons located within adjoining ganglia. We have therefore used immunocytochemistry for activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), a sensitive marker of axonal damage, in order to examine the effects of spinal cord injury in rats on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. A 50-g static compression injury applied to the dorsal surface of the T12 thoracic spinal cord led to an up-regulation of ATF3 that was maximal at 1?day and affected 12?14% of DRG neurons in ganglia caudal to the injury (T13?L3). A similar response was seen after a T12 hemisection that transected the dorsal columns except that compression injury, but not hemisection, also evoked ATF3 expression in ganglia just rostral to the injury (T10, T11). ATF3 was up-regulated exclusively in DRG neurons that were of large diameter and immunoreactive for heavy neurofilament. Small-diameter cells, including the population that binds the lectin Grifffonia simplicifolia IB4, did not express ATF3 immunoreactivity. A similar pattern of ATF3 expression was induced by dorsal rhizotomy. The data show for the first time that ATF3 is up-regulated after spinal cord and dorsal root injury, but that this up-regulation is confined to the large-diameter cell population.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ovarian cancer strikes 23,000 American women every year, accounting for 52% of all gynecological cancer deaths. The death of comedienne Gilda Radner from ovarian cancer in 1991 brought the disease to the forefront for the American public. Unfortunately, since that time, there has been an absence of publicity about this dreadful disease. Seventy-five percent of ovarian cancers are not diagnosed until the cancer has advanced to stage III or IV for several reasons. Clinical guidelines for the diagnostic screening of ovarian cancer have not been developed, which markedly hinders the diagnosis of ovarian cancer until it is in later stages. The tumor marker CA-125 is not specific and, therefore, is an inadequate screening tool. This article discusses the epidemiology of ovarian cancer, the components of diagnostic screening, and treatment options. Nursing care of the patient undergoing surgical treatment for ovarian cancer also is discussed. AORN J 76 (Nov 2002) 792?806.

AB  - Early enteral nutrition (EN) is consistently recommended as first-line nutrition therapy in critically ill patients since it favorably alters outcome, providing both nutrition and nonnutrition benefits. However, critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation are at risk for regurgitation, pulmonary aspiration, and eventually ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). EN may increase these risks when gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is present. Gastric residual volume (GRV) is considered a surrogate parameter of GI dysfunction during the progression of enteral feeding in the early phase of critical illness and beyond. By monitoring GRV, clinicians may detect patients with delayed gastric emptying earlier and intervene with strategies that minimize or prevent VAP as one of the major risks of EN. The value of periodic GRV measurements with regard to risk reduction of VAP incidence has frequently been questioned in the past years. Increasing the GRV threshold before interrupting gastric feeding results in marginal increases in EN delivery. More recently, a large randomized clinical trial revealed that abandoning GRV monitoring did not negatively affect clinical outcomes (including VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. The results have revived the discussion on the role of GRV monitoring in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients receiving early EN. This review summarizes the most recent clinical evidence on the use of GRV monitoring in critically ill patients. Based on the clinical evidence, it discusses the pros and cons and further addresses whether GRV is a dead marker or still alive for the nutrition management of critically ill patients.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series)?Level of Evidence?4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? It is known that urorectal fistulae is a serious but rare complication of the treatment of carcinoma of the prostate. This study adds a distinction between post-surgical fistulate and post-irradiation fistulae. Essentially most post-surgical fistulae are simple and relatively easily dealt with: the expectation is that the patient will return to normality; whereas post-irradiation fistulate are by their nature complex and much more difficult to treat with a much more uncertain long-term outcome. Complexity is discussed and defined. OBJECTIVE ?? To evaluate the management of urorectal fistulae (URF) in light of new technology in prostate cancer treatment, which has changed the nature of these URF and, therefore, the approach to treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS ?? Between 2004 and 2009 we repaired URF after treatment for prostate cancer in 40 patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up since their last intervention. ?? In 23 patients (post-surgical group) the URF resulted from open, laparoscopic or robotic radical prostatectomy. In the other 17 patients (post-irradiation group) the URF resulted from either external beam radiation (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT), or both, salvage cryotherapy or salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (sHIFU). ?? In the 23 patients in the post-surgical group a transperineal repair was performed. In the post-irradiation group a transperineal repair was performed in three of the 17 patients. A transabdominal or abdominoperineal repair was performed in the remaining 14 patients, combined with salvage radical prostatectomy in those eight patients in whom a discrete prostate still existed, and in whom this was possible. RESULTS ?? The URF were cured in all patients. ?? A bladder-neck contracture (BNC) developed in two patients, one of whom is being managed by interval dilatation and the other of whom had a revision of his vesico-urethral anastomosis. Sphincter weakness incontinence required further treatment in eight patients by implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. ?? A specific category of complex URF with cavitation was identified, which is particularly common after sHIFU following the combination of previous EBRT and BT, but which may result from the sequential application of any ?new technology?. CONCLUSIONS ?? URF of any degree of complexity can be managed without the need for a transanorectal sphincter-splitting approach or a covering colostomy and without the need for an interposition flap when the circumstances are appropriate and the surgeon is sufficiently experienced. URF with cavitation and in the post-irradiation group are an exception and do require an interposition flap. ?? The role of salvage radical prostatectomy in patients with a URF who still have a prostate, needs to be defined. ?? We suggest that cavitation, BNC and extensive ischaemia due to the serial application of external energy sources confer ?complexity?. Post-surgical URF are simple except for those with cavitation or a BNC. Most post-irradiation URF are complex even in the absence of cavitation or a BNC.

AB  - Background:? Alcohol use disorders in adolescents are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, there has been a burgeoning of research on adolescent alcohol use disorders. Methods:? A summary of the alcohol assessment tools is provided, and randomized studies reviewed and synthesized to provide an overview of state of the art knowledge of treatment of adolescent alcohol use disorders. Animal models of addiction are also briefly reviewed, and the value of translational research approaches, using findings from basic studies to guide the design of clinical investigations, is also highlighted. Results:? Comorbidity is the rule, not the exception in adolescent alcohol use disorders. Comprehensive assessment of psychiatric and other substance use disorders, trauma experiences, and suicidality is indicated in this population to optimize selection of appropriate clinical interventions. In terms of available investigated treatments for adolescents with alcohol use disorders, Multidimensional Family Therapy and group administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapies have received the most empirical support to date. There is a paucity of research on pharmacological interventions in this patient population, and no firm treatment recommendations can be made in this area. Conclusions:? Given the high rate of relapse after treatment, evaluation of combined psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, and the development of novel intervention strategies are indicated.

AB  - Abstract Background The 2018 Lipids in Parenteral Nutrition summit involved a panel of experts in clinical nutrition, lipid metabolism, and pharmacology, to assess the current state of knowledge and develop expert consensus statements regarding the use of intravenous lipid emulsions in various patient populations and clinical settings. The main purpose of the consensus statements is to assist healthcare professionals by providing practical guidance on common clinical questions related to the provision of lipid emulsions as part of parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods The summit was designed to allow interactive discussion and consensus development. The resulting consensus statements represent the collective opinion of the members of the expert panel, which was informed and supported by scientific evidence and clinical experience. Results The current article summarizes the key discussion topics from the summit and provides a set of consensus statements designed to complement existing evidence-based guidelines. Lipid emulsions are a major component of PN, serving as a condensed source of energy and essential fatty acids. In addition, lipids modulate a variety of biologic functions, including inflammatory and immune responses, coagulation, and cell signaling. A growing body of evidence suggests that lipid emulsions containing ?-3 fatty acids from fish oil confer important clinical benefits via suppression of inflammatory mediators and activation of pathways involved in the resolution of inflammation. Conclusions This article provides a set of expert consensus statements to complement formal PN guideline recommendations.

AB  - The authors study brain regional glucose metabolism prospectively in multiple sclerosis (MS) using high-resolution 2-[18-F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in 25 MS patients of the Dent Neurologic Institute compared with 6 healthy subjects. Glucose metabolism is measured in 20 regions of interest using a line-profile technique. Compared with control subjects, a 9% reduction in total brain glucose metabolism is noted in MS patients (p < 0.05). Hypometabolism is widespread, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical nuclei, supratentorial white matter, and infratentorial structures. This reduction represents absolute regional decreases ranging from 3% to 18%. The most dramatic absolute reductions occur in the superior mesial frontal cortex, superior dorsolateral frontal cortex, mesial occipital cortex, lateral occipital cortex, deep inferior parietal white matter, and pons. The regional hypometabolism in the superior mesial frontal cortex and superior dorsolateral frontal cortex is statistically significant (p < 0.05), whereas the changes in the mesial occipital cortex (p = 0.07) and the lateral occipital cortex (p = 0.09) approach significance. The authors' findings suggest that widespread cerebral dysfunction occurs in MS, and that diaschisis or neuronal system disconnection resulting from white matter disease plays a major role. Cortical gray matter hypometabolism may also reflect direct MS involvement. The quantitative cerebral abnormalities detected by FDG PET may serve as a marker of disease activity in understanding the pathophysiological expression and therapeutic response of MS.

AB  - ABSTRACT Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the plasma portion of blood with a high platelet concentration, has been reported to be helpful in stem cell chondrogenesis due to large amount of growth factors it contains. Here, we examined the influence of PRP on the differentiation of synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) and also evaluated if PRP alone was sufficient to induce SDSCs differentiation. First, the cell proliferation in various differentiation media was analyzed using the MTT assay and it was significantly higher in groups cultured with media that contained PRP. Then, We performed Safranin-O staining and type I, II, and X collagen immunohistochemistry (chondrogenesis), von Kossa staining (osteogenesis), and Oil Red O staining (adipogenesis). The staining was most prominent in groups cultured with optimized differentiation media without PRP in all three lineages of differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of typical differentiation markers were also analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although, culture in optimized differentiation media increased the mRNA expression of the typical differentiation marker genes, they were significantly reduced when cultured in the media supplemented with PRP. PRP has negative effects on SDSC differentiation in all three differentiation lineages and PRP alone does not induce SDSC differentiation. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

Although local recurrence following surgical resection is the characteristic challenge in their management, 40% dogs with high-grade tumours may also develop metastatic disease, despite successful local control. Soft tissue sarcoma is a complex disease and there are many uncertainties regarding the biology and optimal clinical management. There are currently no diagnostic tests that can reliably predict the amount of surgical margin required for a particular tumour, so there can be a mismatch between treatment and disease. Historically, the tendency has been to always recommend wide excision margins but this is not fully supported by recent evidence. A selection bias for less aggressive soft tissue sarcomas in primary care practice can account for good outcomes that are achieved despite narrow surgical excision margins. On the other hand, inappropriately conservative treatment will adversely affect outcomes for patients with more aggressive disease. This review provides an update on the current understanding of management of canine soft tissue sarcomas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Beginning around the year 2000, a number of German writers and film-makers began to send their protagonists into Eastern Europe and beyond. Part of a much larger trend towards the transnational in German-language literature, this development continues the ?Eastern Turn? of the 1990s but reverses the direction of movement. In this article I analyse three recent texts by the Hungarian-born writer Terézia Mora as part of this, by now, multi-directional ?Eastern Turn?: her novels Der einzige Mann auf dem Kontinent (2009) and Das Ungeheuer (2013), and her ?Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen?, a collection of five lectures assembled under the title Nicht sterben (2014). The novels, both of which chronicle migration from Eastern Europe to Germany as well as travel in the opposite direction and feature German as well as immigrant characters, present an astute critique of contemporary neoliberal economic conditions and practices that have an effect on all the main characters, albeit in very different ways. The lectures give insights into Mora's creative process and the importance of her deep cultural and historical connections to Eastern Europe. They also illustrate Mora's move beyond her own experience of migration toward broader fictional contexts. Taken together, the three texts suggest that traditional views of a Western centre and Eastern peripheries need to be revised in favour of models mindful of multi-directional movement and the economies that drive it, and capable of mapping the geographies that emerge as a consequence.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Reconstruction of abdominal wall defects with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF) remains challenging. The purpose of this report is to describe a single-stage approach using combined microscopic enterolysis, pedicle seromuscular bowel flaps, mesh, fasciocutaneous, and myocutaneous flaps. Methods Between 1990 and 2016 a retrospective review identified a total of 18 patients with an average age of 39?years (ranging 26?59?years). Thirteen cases were associated with trauma, four were complication of previous mesh repair, and one was after an aortic dissection. Average diameter of defect size was 22?cm (ranging 20?24?cm). Surgical technique involved enterolysis using microscope magnification, a pedicle seromuscular bowel flap to reinforce the bowel anastomosis, mesh, musculocutaneous, and fasciocutaneous flaps to reconstruct the abdominal wall. Results Fifteen patients required rotational flaps with an average skin paddle area of 442.7 cm2 (ranging 440?cm2?260?cm2) and 10 patients required a serosal patch with an average length of 5 cm (ranging 4?6 cm). Complications included three wound dehiscence and one abdominal wall bulging. Flap survival was 100%. The majority of patients (12 out of 18) were able to resume normal activities, and the remaining (n = 6) were able to resume most activities. Functional outcome as assessed by 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) physical function component questionnaire at 18?24?months follow up was 67.8% (ranging from 59 to 72%). Mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 weeks (ranging 1.4?2.7 weeks). Mean follow-up was 24?months (ranging 22?26?months) with clinical examination. Conclusion Microscopically assisted intra-abdominal dissection with resection of diseased bowel, replacement with well-vascularized tissue at the anastomosis site in, and reinforcement with mesh combined with pedicle musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps may be an alternative when other local reconstructive options have failed.

AB  - Summary ICD-10 contains diagnostic criteria which exist in two versions: diagnostic guidelines for routine clinical use and criteria for research. Mental disorders in the elderly are not a separate category of morbidity, and psychiatric disturbances in the elderly can be classified in any clinically relevant section. The dementias are embedded in the section on organic and symptomatic mental disorders (?organic? meaning that the disorder can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or systemic disease). Entry points at the level of clinical syndrome are: dementia; amnesic syndrome; delirium; organic quasi-functional disorder; and personality disorder. Once dementia is established, the diagnostic process branches off into the clinical forms of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia in diseases classified elsewhere. Multi-axial coding can be achieved by using extra codes from other ICD-10 chapters for physical disorders; or by using the multi-axial system now available, with axes for clinical diagnosis, disablements and contextual factors.
