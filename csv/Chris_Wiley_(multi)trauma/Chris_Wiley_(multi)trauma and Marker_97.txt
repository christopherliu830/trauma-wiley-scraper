AB  - ABSTRACT Beginning around the year 2000, a number of German writers and film-makers began to send their protagonists into Eastern Europe and beyond. Part of a much larger trend towards the transnational in German-language literature, this development continues the ?Eastern Turn? of the 1990s but reverses the direction of movement. In this article I analyse three recent texts by the Hungarian-born writer Terézia Mora as part of this, by now, multi-directional ?Eastern Turn?: her novels Der einzige Mann auf dem Kontinent (2009) and Das Ungeheuer (2013), and her ?Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen?, a collection of five lectures assembled under the title Nicht sterben (2014). The novels, both of which chronicle migration from Eastern Europe to Germany as well as travel in the opposite direction and feature German as well as immigrant characters, present an astute critique of contemporary neoliberal economic conditions and practices that have an effect on all the main characters, albeit in very different ways. The lectures give insights into Mora's creative process and the importance of her deep cultural and historical connections to Eastern Europe. They also illustrate Mora's move beyond her own experience of migration toward broader fictional contexts. Taken together, the three texts suggest that traditional views of a Western centre and Eastern peripheries need to be revised in favour of models mindful of multi-directional movement and the economies that drive it, and capable of mapping the geographies that emerge as a consequence.

AB  - Latina feminists like Gloria Anzaldúa and Mariana Ortega have developed anti-essentialist accounts of selfhood that are responsive to the problem of alterity and hermeneutic alienation experienced by multiplicitous subjects, understood as those who must navigate between multiple cultural norms and often conflicting interpretive traditions (due to colonial legacies and intersectional oppressions). These accounts can be fortified by examining the sense of inarticulacy that arises from having to name conditions of existence undergirded by social and historical contradictions and ambiguities?especially under the experiential stress of gendered social violence, cultural trauma, and state terror. To address phenomenological accounts of ?linguistic terrorism? and the role language plays in multiplicitous accounts of selfhood, I turn to a strategic reading of Nietzsche's existential conception of the self as a living multiplicity, and to his related account of the impoverishment of language. In doing so, I argue more generally that philosophies of agency that critique agential narratives of rupture, instability, and interpretive loss (as part of liberal emancipatory projects) often do so without sufficient attunement to the ways concepts of alterity and liminality operate in North?South contexts or Latina feminist thought. I end by highlighting the critical, decolonial impetus of these concepts as responses to cultural violence.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial players in chromatin regulation. Their diversity allows them to partake in the regulation of numerous cellular processes across species. During development, long and short ncRNAs act in conjunction with each other where long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are best understood in establishing appropriate gene expression patterns, while short ncRNAs (sRNAs) are known to establish constitutive heterochromatin and suppress mobile elements. Additionally, increasing evidence demonstrates roles of sRNAs in several typically lncRNA-mediated processes such as dosage compensation, indicating a complex regulatory network of noncoding RNAs. Together, various ncRNAs establish many mitotically heritable epigenetic marks during development. Additionally, they participate in mechanisms that regulate maintenance of these epigenetic marks during the lifespan of the organism. Interestingly, some epigenetic traits are transmitted to the next generation(s) via paramutations or transgenerational inheritance mediated by sRNAs. In this review, we give an overview of the various functions and regulations of ncRNAs and the mechanisms they employ in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks and multi-generational transmission of epigenetic traits.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.

AB  - Abstract Background. Distraction osteogenesis is an established technique for the lengthening of long bones and correction of selected craniofacial deformities. Regenerate osteoid bone matrix formed during the distraction phase is malleable and can recreate the three-dimensional form of native bones. Animal experiments and early clinical experience have confirmed that distraction osteogenesis can be used for the reconstruction of segmental bony defects. Herein we discuss the principles of distraction osteogenesis in reference to reconstruction of segmental bony defects and report its clinical application of the mandible continuity defects. Patients and Methods. Four patients (age, 7?83 years) with critical segmental mandibular defects (range, 3.5 cm?6.5 cm), resulting from ablative oncologic head and neck surgery underwent primary mandibular reconstruction by transport distraction osteogenesis. Two defects were at the angle and body region, one at the body, and the other at the parasymphysis and body region. Synthes Titanium Multi-vector and Leibinger Multi-guide distractors in bifocal (n = 2) and trifocal (n = 2) architecture were used after the stabilization of the segmental continuity defect using a defect-bridging mandibular reconstruction plate. Osteodistraction was carried out at a rate of 1 mm per day, with once or twice a day rhythm, after a 1-week latency period. The consolidation period was equal to the period of distraction. Results. All patients tolerated the distraction procedure. Satisfactory bone formation was observed in two patients, and partial bone formation was seen in one patient. Treatment failure was encountered in one patient who had a second oral cavity primary tumor observed during the consolidation period, requiring interruption of the treatment sequence. Conclusions. Mandibular reconstruction with distraction osteogenesis is a potentially useful technique in selected patients with segmental mandibular continuity defects after ablative head and neck cancer surgery. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Functional chronic visceral pain (FCVP) is one of the most common causes of morbidity in the general population. Pain perceived within the abdomen may occur due to a range of different mechanisms according to the organ and their afferent pathways. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of FCVP could lead to the exploitation of contemporary research in order to develop and utilize our understanding of neurobiological and psychobiological visceral mechanisms in a clinical setting. This progression, together with increasing amounts of epidemiological and gender based information concerning specific abdominal pain syndromes can allow us to develop assessment tools that go beyond disease only analysis and move toward a more comprehensive assessment model so that patients may have access to expert or multidisciplinary management sooner, rather than later. Based on current evidence, one must consider the main contributors to pain, whether it is nociceptive, neuropathic or psychosocial or as is common with FCVP, a combination of all three. Aim.? This comprehensive assessment model should encompass not only systematic evaluation for reliable communication, but should also progress toward idiographic diagnosis relating to the uniqueness of the patient. This model should be practical in a multidisciplinary setting, taking into account the multi-faceted nature of this presentation.

AB  - Abstract Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have become an indispensable tool in the management of end-stage cardiac failure, both as a means of bridging to cardiac transplantation and as destination therapy for long-term quality of life improvement. Although the technology continues to advance and these devices continue to be refined, they are still associated with significant complications. This article reviews the basics of VAD function and physiology, as well as the myriad to complications that follow their implantation. This review aims to provide a systematic approach to the troubleshooting, diagnosis and management of both VAD-associated complications and the resuscitation of the decompensated VAD patient presenting to the ED.

AB  - Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or folate hydrolase, is a metallopeptidase expressed predominantly in the human brain and prostate. GCPII expression is considerably increased in prostate carcinoma, and the enzyme also participates in glutamate excitotoxicity in the brain. Therefore, GCPII represents an important diagnostic marker of prostate cancer progression and a putative target for the treatment of both prostate cancer and neuronal disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity. For the development of novel therapeutics, mouse models are widely used. However, although mouse GCPII activity has been characterized, a detailed comparison of the enzymatic activity and tissue distribution of the mouse and human GCPII orthologs remains lacking. In this study, we prepared extracellular mouse GCPII and compared it with human GCPII. We found that mouse GCPII possesses lower catalytic efficiency but similar substrate specificity compared with the human protein. Using a panel of GCPII inhibitors, we discovered that inhibition constants are generally similar for mouse and human GCPII. Furthermore, we observed highest expression of GCPII protein in the mouse kidney, brain, and salivary glands. Importantly, we did not detect GCPII in the mouse prostate. Our data suggest that the differences in enzymatic activity and inhibition profile are rather small; therefore, mouse GCPII can approximate human GCPII in drug development and testing. On the other hand, significant differences in GCPII tissue expression must be taken into account when developing novel GCPII-based anticancer and therapeutic methods, including targeted anticancer drug delivery systems, and when using mice as a model organism.

AB  - Abstract Background Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a treatment option for intractable fecal incontinence. The mechanism of action is unclear, however, increasing evidence for afferent somatosensory effects exists. This study's aim was to elucidate effects of acute SNM on the cerebral cortex in a rodent model of pudendal nerve injury. Methods The effects of 14 Hz and 2 Hz SNM on sensory cortical activation were studied. In 32 anesthetized rats, anal canal evoked potentials (EPs) were recorded over the primary somatosensory cortex. Pudendal nerve injury was produced by 1-hour inflation of two intra-pelvic balloons. Four groups were studied: balloon injury, balloon injury plus either 14 Hz or 2 Hz SNM, sham operation. Immunohistochemistry for the neural plasticity marker polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) positive cells (numerical density and location) in the somatosensory cortex was performed. Key Results Anal EP amplitudes diminished during balloon inflation; 14 Hz SNM restored diminished anal EPs to initial levels and 2 Hz SNM to above initial levels. Evoked potential latencies were prolonged during balloon inflation. The numerical density of PSA-NCAM positive cells increased in the SNM groups, but not in sham or balloon injury without SNM. Stimulated cortices showed clusters of PSA-NCAM positive cells in layers II, IV, and V. Post SNM changes were similar in both SNM groups. Conclusions & Inferences Sacral neuromodulation augments anal representation in the sensory cortex and restores afferent pathways following injury. PSA-NCAM positive cell density is increased in stimulated cortices and positive cells are clustered in layers II, IV, and V.

There were no statistically significant differences in the mean age of the groups or in the cortical atrophy score as measured by the mean width of the four largest sulci in the three uppermost tomographic cuts. Instead, the delirious patients differed from the controls in the frontal horn and cella media indices, in the width of the third ventricle and Sylvian fissure at insula on the left side. There was also a significant excess of low attenuation, brain infarct-type areas in the delirious patients. The study confirms the marked predisposing role of the structural brain diseases (primary degenerative and multi-infarct type dementias, Parkinsonism) in the development of acute delirium in elderly patients.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic syndrome that confers significantly increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with 50?60% of infants with TSC meeting criteria for ASD by 3 years of age. In a previous study of the current longitudinal cohort, we found that infants with TSC who develop ASD (TSC/ASD) evidence decreased cognitive abilities that diverge from infants with TSC and no ASD (TSC/no ASD). We extended this work by asking whether TSC/ASD infants (n?=?13) differed from TSC/no ASD infants (n?=?10) and infants with low developmental risk and no ASD (LR; n?=?21) in their social communication functioning during the first year of life. We measured early ASD symptoms with the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) at 9 and 12 months of age. At both ages, infants in the TSC/ASD group had significantly higher AOSI total scores than infants in the TSC/no ASD and LR groups, which were not fully explained by differences in cognitive abilities. Several items on the AOSI at both ages were predictive of ASD outcome, particularly those representing core social communication deficits (e.g., social referencing). Our findings signal the need for further study of this population within the first year and provide strong justification for early identification and early intervention targeting social communication skills in infants with TSC. Autism Res 2017, 10: 1981?1990. ? 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary We examined early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), approximately 50% of whom will meet criteria for ASD by age 3. Infants with TSC and ASD showed deficits in social communication behaviors by 9 months of age that were clearly distinguishable from behaviors in infants with TSC who do not develop ASD and low risk infants. Results support the importance of early ASD screening and intervention for infants with TSC.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - Abstract The close proximity of pelvic organs makes the genitourinary system susceptible to injury during major pelvic surgery. Iatrogenic injury remains the most common cause of lower urinary tract trauma. Recent modifications in surgical technique, such as sharp mesorectal incision and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, have decreased the incidence of many of these complications. Genitourinary complications due to pelvic surgery remain common, however, and as new surgical advancements are made, new complications may present. An understanding of the prevention, recognition, and treatment of urologic complications is important for every surgeon performing major pelvic surgery. Semin. Surg.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, special considerations, equipment, procedure, and prognosis of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in dogs and cats, along with a few complication examples. PEG is often the preferred method of gastric tube placement because visibility is ideal and the procedure is fast, effective, and safe. Surgically placed gastrotomy tubes are generally elected when wound healing is in question or if a laparotomy is required. These tubes offer the benefit of creating an adhesion between the stomach and body wall, ensuring stoma formation and minimizing complication risk. A standard gastroduodenoscope is utilized to facilitate placement of the feeding tube. Placement of low profile tubes through the stoma differs with tube manufacturer. Some low profile tubes require an internal blunt stylet. This is typically a Malecot type of tube.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of the current study was to investigate the multi-dimensional characteristics of lumbar endplate defects in humans in relation to disc degeneration and other MRI phenotypes as well as their role with pain and disability. A total of 108 subjects were recruited and underwent 3T MRI of the lumbar spine. Structural endplate defects were identified and their dimensions were measured in terms of maximum width and depth, and were then standardized to the actual width of the endplate and depth of the vertebral body, respectively. Both width and depth of all endplate defects in each subject were added separately and scores were assigned on the basis of size from 1 to 3. Combining both scores provided ?cumulative endplate defect scores.? Disc degeneration scores, Modic changes, disc displacement, HIZ, and facet joint changes were assessed. Subject demographics, pain profile, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were also obtained. Endplate defects were observed in 67.5% of the subjects and in 13.5% of the endplates. All dimensions of endplate defects showed significance with disc degenerative scores, Modic changes, and posterior disc displacement (p?<?0.05). Maximum width (p?=?0.009) and its standardized value (p?=?0.02), and cumulative endplate defect scores (p?=?0.004) increased with narrow facet joints. Cumulative endplate defect scores showed a strong positive association with ODI (p?<?0.05) compared to disc degenerative scores. Large size endplate defects were strongly associated with degenerative spine changes and more back-related disability. Findings from this study stress the need to assess endplate findings from a multi-dimensional perspective, whose role may have clinical utility. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.
