AB  - Over a long career in both ablative and reconstructive surgery in the head and neck, the author has identified certain factors which help in the management of these patients and has learned many lessons. Such lessons include the importance of multi-disciplinary management, excellence in anaesthesia, the importance of anatomy, concepts of ablative surgery such as marginal mandibular resection, and many of the concepts of reconstructive surgery which have enabled rapid one stage reconstructions, such that palliative surgery for massive tumours can be sometimes worthwhile. These and other experiences will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the criteria for the insertion and correct placement of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in dogs. Study design? Prospective descriptive clinical study. Animals? Thirty healthy dogs (ASA I or II) of different breeds, age 0.33?7.0?years (2.8?±?2.1; mean?± SD), weight 2.2?59.0?kg (23.9?±?14.4), anaesthetized for elective surgery. Materials and methods? The dogs were sedated with intravenous (IV) medetomidine (10??g?kg?1) and butorphanol (0.2?mg?kg?1). If considered necessary, IV propofol (1?mg?kg?1 over 30?seconds) was administered until the LMA was inserted and positioned correctly. The position of the LMA was evaluated using predefined criteria for its insertion and inflation of the cuff, together with the ability to ventilate the dogs through the LMA. Results? The criteria for insertion, inflation and ventilation which indicated a clinically optimal position of the LMA and its seal around the larynx were met in 19 dogs (63.3%). The dogs could be manually ventilated with inspiratory peak pressures of 10?cm H2O without capnographic or audible evidence of leakage. In 11 dogs (36.7%), the LMA was positioned suboptimally with leakage during manual ventilation with inspiratory peak pressures not exceeding 10?cmH2O. There was no evidence of breed-related differences in LMA placement and position. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The technique for the insertion of the LMA using predefined criteria to evaluate a correct positioning and a seal led to a successful placement in dogs of both brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic breeds. The LMA, in most of the dogs, was easily placed, well tolerated and offered a useful less invasive means of securing the upper airway.

AB  - Abstract The influence of pancreatic resection on early systemic complications of acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated in 84 patients. The aetiology of pancreatitis was alcohol 71 per cent, gallstones 13 per cent, alcohol plus gallstones 2 per cent, trauma 1 per cent and idiopathic 12 per cent. A total of 26 of 81 patients (32 per cent) had greater than 50 per cent pancreatic necrosis and 9 patients (11 per cent) considered to have parenchymal necrosis at operation had none shown histologically. The overall mortality was 38/84 (45 per cent) and mortality during the first postoperative week was 15/84 (18 per cent). The outcome after early and delayed operation did not differ significantly. Pancreatic resection had no beneficial effect on shock or respiratory or renal failure (respective pre-operative incidence 12 per cent, 11 per cent and 14 per cent).

AB  - Background:? Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods:? We recruited patients admitted to our University Hospital with an acute ICH and analysed pre-admission demographic variables, pre-morbid therapy, clinical and radiological prognostic markers and outcome variables including 90-day modified Rankin score and NIH stroke scale score (NIHSS). Results:? We recruited 399 patients with ICH of which 101 (25%) were using statins. Statin users more often had vascular risk factors, had significantly lower haematoma volumes (P?=?0.04) and had lower mortality rates compared with non-users (45.6% vs. 56.1%; P?=?0.11). However, statin treatment did not have a statistically significant impact on mortality or functional outcome on multiple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions:? Treatment with statins prior to ICH failed to show a significant impact on outcome in this analysis despite lower haematoma volumes.

AB  - Total N-acetyl-aspartate + N-acetyl-aspartate?glutamate (NAA), total creatine (Cr) and total choline (Cho) proton MRS (1H?MRS) signals are often used as surrogate markers in diffuse neurological pathologies, but spatial coverage of this methodology is limited to 1%?65% of the brain. Here we wish to demonstrate that non-localized, whole-head (WH) 1H?MRS captures just the brain's contribution to the Cho and Cr signals, ignoring all other compartments. Towards this end, 27 young healthy adults (18 men, 9 women), 29.9 ± 8.5 years old, were recruited and underwent T1-weighted MRI for tissue segmentation, non-localizing, approximately 3 min WH 1H?MRS (TE/TR/TI = 5/10/940 ms) and 30 min 1H?MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (TE/TR = 35/2100 ms) in a 360 cm3 volume of interest (VOI) at the brain's center. The VOI absolute NAA, Cr and Cho concentrations, 7.7 ± 0.5, 5.5 ± 0.4 and 1.3 ± 0.2 mM, were all within 10% of the WH: 8.6 ± 1.1, 6.0 ± 1.0 and 1.3 ± 0.2 mM. The mean NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios in the WH were only slightly higher than the ?brain-only? VOI: 1.5 versus 1.4 (7%) and 6.6 versus 5.9 (11%); Cho/Cr were not different. The brain/WH volume ratio was 0.31 ± 0.03 (brain ≈ 30% of WH volume). Air-tissue susceptibility-driven local magnetic field changes going from the brain outwards showed sharp gradients of more than 100 Hz/cm (1 ppm/cm), explaining the skull's Cr and Cho signal losses through resonance shifts, line broadening and destructive interference. The similarity of non-localized WH and localized VOI NAA, Cr and Cho concentrations and their ratios suggests that their signals originate predominantly from the brain. Therefore, the fast, comprehensive WH-1H-MRS method may facilitate quantification of these metabolites, which are common surrogate markers in neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract Corneal opacities are a leading cause of global blindness. They are conventionally treated by the transplantation of donor corneal tissue, which is, restricted by a worldwide donor material shortage and allograft rejection. Autologous adult stem cells with a potential to differentiate into corneal stromal keratocytes (CSKs) could offer a suitable choice of cells for regenerative cell therapy. Postnatal periodontal ligament (PDL) contains a population of adult stem cells, which has a similar embryological origin as CSK, that is cranial neural crest. We harvested PDL cells from young adult teeth extracted because of non-functional or orthodontic reason and differentiated them towards CSK phenotype using a two-step protocol with spheroid formation followed by growth factor and cytokine induction in a stromal environment (human amnion stroma and porcine corneal stroma). Our results showed that the PDL-differentiated CSK-like cells expressed CSK markers (CD34, ALDH3A1, keratocan, lumican, CHST6, B3GNT7 and Col8A2) and had minimal expression of genes related to fibrosis and other lineages (vasculogenesis, adipogenesis, myogenesis, epitheliogenesis, neurogenesis and hematogenesis). Introduction of PDL spheroids into the stroma of porcine corneas resulted in extensive migration of cells inside the host stroma after 14-day organ culture. Their quiescent nature and uniform cell distribution resembled to that of mature CSKs inside the native stroma. Our results demonstrated the potential translation of PDL cells for regenerative corneal cell therapy for corneal opacities.

AB  - Obligatory nitrogen losses due to paralysis in the spinal cord-injured (SCI) patient prevent positive nitrogen balance (NB) regardless of the calorie and protein intakes. Ten patients with SCI and 20 controls with nonspinal cord injury (NSCI) matched for time, sex, age, and injury severity score (ISS) were admitted to our Level I trauma center. In both groups, total nutritional support was delivered within 72 hours of admission based on predicted energy expenditures (PEE = Harris-Benedict equation x 1.2 x 1.6) and 2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Subsequent changes in nutrient delivery were based on NB. No SCI patient established positive NB during the 7-week period following injury despite an average delivery of 2.4 g of protein/kg IBW and 120% of the PEE at the time of peak negative NB (-10.5). In six SCI patients, an average increase of 25% in delivered protein and 12% in delivered calories over a 1-week period effected no change in average NB (-7.4 us -6.8). Indirect calorimetry in five SCI patients showed that calorie intakes were 110% more than average measured energy expenditures. In contrast, 17 of 20 NCSI patients achieved positive NB within 3 weeks of admission. They required an average delivery of 2.3 g of protein/kg IBW and 110% of PEE to reach positive NB. These data demonstrate the phenomenon of obligatory negative NB acutely following SCI. Aggressive attempts to achieve positive NB in these patients will fail and result in overfeeding.

AB  - Aims 1 To re-evaluate the basic anatomy of the lymphatic vessel network in the head and neck region for diagnosis and treatment of lymphogenic cancer metastases. 2 To compare the anatomy of the lymphatic system with the venous system. 3 To investigate the possibility that extensive lymphatic-venous connections exist. Materials and Methods? The lymphatic vessels in the scalp, face and neck of 5 (ten halves) fresh human cadavers were identified by using 6% hydrogen peroxide with and without India ink, then injecting the vessels with a lead oxide, milk powder and water mixture. The specimens were photographed, radiographed and analyzed. Results? Radiographs and photographs show: 1 The lymphatic pathway ?patterns? found were different in each specimen, even each side of the same head showed considerable variation. 2 The lymphatic pathways of the anterior neck lie in the tissue above the platysma and course horizontally and obliquely. This finding confirm those found using lymphoscintigraphy 3 The discovery of lymphatic bypass routes confirms the lymphoscintigraphy findings that lymphatic drainage does not always go directly to the first tier lymph nodes. 4 We were able to compare the anatomical relationship of the lymphatic and venous systems and demonstrate that a lymphatic-venous shunt does exist in the occipital region. Conclusion? This study provides an anatomical picture of the superficial lymphatic system of the head and neck and will aid surgical management in the treatment of trauma, infection, lymphoedema and cancer.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since testing for HIV infection became possible in 1985, testing of pregnant women has been conducted primarily on a voluntary, ?opt-in? basis. Faden, Geller and Powers, Bayer, Wilfert, and McKenna, among others, have suggested that with the development of more reliable testing and more effective therapy to reduce maternal-fetal transmission, testing should become either routine with ?opt-out? provisions or mandatory. We ask, in the light of the new rapid tests for HIV, such as OraQuick, and the development of antiretroviral treatment that can reduce maternal-fetal transmission rates to <2%, whether that time is now. Illustrating our argument with cases from the United States (US), Kenya, Peru, and an undocumented Mexican worker in the US, we show that when testing is accompanied by assured multi-drug therapy for the mother, the argument for opt-out or mandatory testing for HIV in pregnancy is strong, but that it is problematic where testing is accompanied by adverse events such as spousal abuse or by inadequate intrapartum or follow-up treatment. The difference is not a ?double standard?, but reflects the presence of conflicts between the health interests of the mother and the fetus ? conflicts that would be abrogated by the assurance of adequate, continuing multi-drug therapy. In light of these conflicts, where they still occur, careful processes of informed consent are appropriate, rather than opt-out or mandatory testing.

AB  - Introduction? Nasal trauma in childhood is a frequent occurrence. Management of resultant fractures in the paediatric age group presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The immature patient is less likely to be cooperative with examination, and clinical evaluation is difficult owing to facial oedema and lack of rigidity of the nasal bones. Subsequent nasal growth and development must be considered in determining the most appropriate treatment. Closed reduction of nasal fractures is usually undertaken at the Wellington Regional Plastic, Maxillofacial & Burns Unit at Hutt Hospital. Little exists in the form of follow-up studies assessing patient satisfaction following this technique. Methods? A retrospective chart reviewed yielded 39 patients aged under seventeen years who underwent closed reduction of their nasal fracture during the two year period ending in July 2006 at Hutt Hospital. Follow-up was between three and twenty-seven months. A structured telephone interview was carried out to assess the degree of satisfaction with both functional and aesthetic outcome present in this group. Patients and their parents were invited to respond. Results? Most patients and their families are satisfied with nasal function and appearance following closed reduction. Few had subsequently sought or would consider a secondary open procedure in the form of septorhinoplasty. Conclusion? Closed reduction remains a satisfactory treatment in this age group. On the basis of patient satisfaction, it is successful in maintaining the function and appearance of the nose in most.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to critically appraise and highlight medical education research published in 2012 that was methodologically superior and whose outcomes were pertinent to teaching and education in emergency medicine (EM). Methods A search of the English language literature in 2012 querying Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychInfo, PubMed, and Scopus identified EM studies using hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions. Two reviewers independently screened all of the publications and removed articles using established exclusion criteria. This year, publications limited to a single-site survey design that measured satisfaction or self-assessment on unvalidated instruments were not formally reviewed. Six reviewers then independently ranked all remaining publications using one of two scoring systems depending on whether the study methodology was primarily qualitative or quantitative. Each scoring system had nine criteria, including four related to methodology, that were chosen a priori, to standardize evaluation by reviewers. The quantitative study scoring system was used previously to appraise medical education published annually in 2008 through 2011, while a separate, new qualitative study scoring system was derived and implemented consisting of parallel metrics. Results Forty-eight medical education research papers met the a priori criteria for inclusion, and 33 (30 quantitative and three qualitative studies) were reviewed. Seven quantitative and two qualitative studies met the criteria for inclusion as exemplary and are summarized in this article. Conclusions This critical appraisal series aims to promote superior education research by reviewing and highlighting nine of the 48 major education research studies with relevance to EM published in 2012. Current trends and common methodologic pitfalls in the 2012 papers are noted.

AB  - Abstract Electrodes can provide information on neural function and stimulate neural activity. These neural electrodes can provide remarkable benefit to people suffering physical trauma or neural disease. Traditional metal electrodes have shortcomings related to poor biostability, cytocompatibility, and a rigid structure that maps poorly to tissue. Organic conductors can be formed with various chemical and physical properties to create improved electrode-neural interfaces. The processability of organic conductors enables their use in advanced fabrication methods. This review details the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conducting polymers for neural interfacing. Construction of novel neural electrode architectures via advanced fabrication processes is also addressed.

AB  - Summary An abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery, or by opening or re-opening the abdomen for abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal wall tissue loss following trauma or tumour also produces significant defects. This chapter first presents some key notes on management of the open abdomen. It then discusses perineal reconstruction and hypospadias. Perineal reconstruction is indicated in these circumstances: extensive skin loss; vaginal resection; pelvic or perineal dead space; excision of the pelvic floor; and excision after radiotherapy. The chapter also presents brief discussions of bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex, ambiguous genitalia, vaginal agenesis and penile reconstruction.

AB  - Summary Lymphoma, although rare, is the most common haematopoietic neoplasm encountered in horses and can occur at any age, with horses 4?10 years more commonly affected. Lymphoma can be classified into multicentric, alimentary, mediastinal, cutaneous and solitary. Clinical signs are typically nonspecific until the disease has progressed to end-stage at which time clinical signs reflect function of organ(s) involved. Horses with the cutaneous form of lymphoma typically present with multifocal skin lesions and no other clinical signs. Like the nonspecific clinical signs of lymphoma, results of complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistries are not often helpful with diagnosis, but lymphoma should be considered if anaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are observed without a clear indication of infectious disease. Identification of neoplastic lymphocytes during cytological examination of a body cavity effusion can confirm the presence of lymphoma. Typically, ante mortem confirmation of lymphoma is made through histopathological examination of a biopsy or cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate of a suspected lesion. Observation of compression or destruction of normal tissue architecture by invading neoplastic cells during histological examination is indicative of lymphoma. Additional diagnostics that may improve our knowledge of equine lymphoma include detection of hormone receptors, immunophenotyping, and immunohistochemical analysis for tumour proliferation rates. Prognosis of horses with lymphoma depends on the form of lymphoma and stage at which the horse is presented but death is the common outcome of this disease. Current treatment options are surgical excision, radiation or administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Treatment of horses with lymphoma can result in palliation and occasional resolution of this disease. Equine oncology is in its infancy, but through further documentation of horses with lymphoma and their response to therapy, a clearer understanding of the disease process and effective treatment of this neoplasm can be developed.

AB  - Abstract Background Early identification of emergency medicine (EM) residents who struggle with educational attainment is difficult. In-training examination (ITE) scores predict success on the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) Qualifying Examination; however, results are not available until late in the academic year. The noncognitive trait ?grit,? defined as ?perseverance and passion for long-term goals,? predicts achievement in high school graduation rates, undergraduate GPA, and gross anatomy. Grit-S is a validated eight-question scale scored 1 to 5; the average of responses represents a person?s grit. Our objective was to determine the correlation between EM resident Grit-S scores and achievement, as measured by MCAT percentiles, ITE scores, and remediation rates. Study Design and Methods This was a 1-year prospective, multicenter trial involving ten EM residencies from 2017 to 2018. Subjects were PGY-1 to -4 EM residents. Grit-S scores, MCAT percentile, remediation rates, ITE scores, and the ITE score?s prediction of passing the ABEM Qualifying Examination were collected. Correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between residents? grit and achievement. Results A total 385 of 434 (88.7%) residents participated who completed the Grit-S as part of a larger study. The mean Grit-S score was 3.62. Grit positively correlated with the predicted likelihood of passing the ABEM Qualifying Examination (r = 0.134, n = 382, p = 0.025). There was no correlation between grit and remediation (r = ?0.04, n = 378, p = 0.46) or grit and MCAT percentiles (r =? 0.08, n = 262, p = 0.22). Conclusions The positive correlation between Grit-S scores and percent likelihood of passing the ABEM Qualifying Examination demonstrates grit?s potential to assist residency leadership in early identification of residents who may attain a lower ITE score.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the equipment needed for the interventional endoscopy (IE) procedures. A C-arm fluoroscopy unit is ideal for most IE procedures. Lithotripsy is performed for stone removal. For larger stone burdens intracorporeal lithotripsy is recommended. This can be done using laser, electrohydraulic, ultrasonic, pneumatic, and/or intracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. The stents most commonly used in IE cases are either metallic or polyurethane. A subcutaneous ureteral bypass device (SUB) is currently placed with surgical-assistance under fluoroscopic guidance. Setting up an IE suite requires meticulous organization. When setting up for an IE procedure it is important that the operator has all the equipment necessary, the procedure is well thought out, and the room is appropriately organized. The operator should have more than one wire, catheter, needle, balloon, laser fiber, basket, available in the event one breaks, gets contaminated, or becomes difficult to use over time.
