AB  - New-onset diabetes after liver transplantation (NODALT) is a frequent complication with an unfavorable outcome. We previously demonstrated a crucial link between donor graft genetics and the risk of NODALT. We selected 15 matched pairs of NODALT and non-NODALT liver recipients using propensity score matching analysis. The donor liver tissues were tested for the expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating human hepatic glucose homeostasis. The biological functions of potential target genes were predicted using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Both miR-103 and miR-181a were significantly highly expressed in the NODALT group as compared to the non-NODALT group. The predicted target genes (e.g. Irs2, Pik3r1, Akt2, and Gsk3b) were involved in glucose import and the insulin signaling pathway. We also observed dysregulation of miRNAs (e.g. let-7, miR-26b, miR-145, and miR-183) in cultured human hepatocytes treated with tacrolimus or high glucose, the two independent risk factors of NODALT identified in this cohort. The hepatic miRNA profiles altered by tacrolimus or hyperglycemia were associated with insulin resistance and glucose homeostatic imbalance as revealed by enrichment analysis. The disease susceptibility miRNA expressive pattern could be imported directly from the donor and consolidated by the transplant factors.

AB  - This paper reviews the research evidence concerning the intergenerational transmission of trauma effects and the possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in this transmission. Two broad categories of epigenetically mediated effects are highlighted. The first involves developmentally programmed effects. These can result from the influence of the offspring's early environmental exposures, including postnatal maternal care as well as in utero exposure reflecting maternal stress during pregnancy. The second includes epigenetic changes associated with a preconception trauma in parents that may affect the germline, and impact fetoplacental interactions. Several factors, such as sex-specific epigenetic effects following trauma exposure and parental developmental stage at the time of exposure, explain different effects of maternal and paternal trauma. The most compelling work to date has been done in animal models, where the opportunity for controlled designs enables clear interpretations of transmissible effects. Given the paucity of human studies and the methodological challenges in conducting such studies, it is not possible to attribute intergenerational effects in humans to a single set of biological or other determinants at this time. Elucidating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in intergenerational effects through prospective, multi-generational studies may ultimately yield a cogent understanding of how individual, cultural and societal experiences permeate our biology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, functional, noncoding RNAs of 19 to 23 nucleotides which induce degradation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thus controlling the translational process (ie, synthesis of proteins from mRNAs). In addition, mRNAs regulate the promoter of specific miRNAs activating an autoregulatory feedback loop. Purpose: Titanium and zirconium dioxide ceramics (ZDCs) are used to make dental implants. Because the molecular mechanism by which ZDC and Ti act on osteoblasts is incompletely understood, we attempted to get more information by comparing the effect of ZDC and Ti on osteoblast miRNAs. Materials and Methods: By using miRNA microarray technique, we identified in osteoblast-like cell line (MG63) grown on grade 3 Ti and ZDC disks several miRNAs whose expression was modified. We collected mRNAs after 24 hours of cell culturing to better understand molecular events related to early bone healing around inserted implants. An mRNA microarray technique was then performed as a control. Results: There were six up- and four down-regulated miRNAs. Because every miRNA regulates hundreds of genes, we focused only on those related to bone formation. Among them, the most notable are BMP4 and 7, which are both up-regulated in osteoblasts cultured on Ti disks. Conclusion: The detected miRNAs differentially expressed in osteoblast-like cells grown on ZDC versus Ti act on a limited number of miRNAs and bone-related genes. The most notable are BMP4 and 7, which are more expressed in osteoblasts exposed to Ti surface. Consequently, we suggest that Ti surfaces could provide some advantages to immediate load implantology.

AB  - Summary Patients who have sustained brain injury or had developmental brain lesions present a non-negligible risk for developing delayed epilepsy. Finding therapeutic strategies to prevent development of epilepsy in at-risk patients represents a crucial medical challenge. Noncoding microRNA molecules (miRNAs) are promising candidates in this area. Indeed, deregulation of diverse brain-specific miRNAs has been observed in animal models of epilepsy as well as in patients with epilepsy, mostly in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Herein we review deregulated miRNAs reported in epilepsy with potential roles in key molecular and cellular processes underlying epileptogenesis, namely neuroinflammation, cell proliferation and differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and synaptic remodeling. We provide an up-to-date listing of miRNAs altered in epileptogenesis and assess recent functional studies that have interrogated their role in epilepsy. Last, we discuss potential applications of these findings for the future development of disease-modifying therapeutic strategies for antiepileptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Cartilage has limited repair and regeneration capacity, thus damage of cartilage often results in its dysfunction and even chronic diseases like osteoarthritis (OA). Chondrogenesis induced by tissue-engineering methods is essential to treating cartilage-related diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNAs which exert their biological effects by binding to the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), resulting in decay or translation suppression of target mRNAs. There are emerging evidence indicating that miRNAs may play important roles in regulating both prenatal and postnatal chondrogenesis. During embryonic skeletal development, prenatal chondrogenesis is thought to be a precondition for formation of cartilage in developing limbs. Plenty of studies on different types of stem cells have undoubtedly proven their capacity of differentiating into chondrocytes. MiRNAs are found to comprehensively modulate these processes by establishing an interaction network with target genes, transcription factors and cytokines et al. In addition, translational application of miRNA technology has also been explored. In this review, we focus on the up-dated progress on regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in prenatal and postnatal chondrogenesis. In addition, several miRNA target genes and roles of miRNAs in cartilage-related diseases are also discussed. This will contribute to studies of chondrogenesis mechanisms and development of new treating methods.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Equine sarcoids are locally aggressive fibroblastic cutaneous tumours, representing the third most common health problem in working horses. In developed countries they also have welfare and economic impact (e.g. prepurchase examination). No current treatment offers 100% success rate. It is now well established that Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoid tumours. In a number of human cancers, aberrant expression of microRNAs has been linked to the cancerous phenotype. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate essential biological and cellular processes. Currently there is much interest in their role as biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents for many diseases. Objectives In an attempt to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of sarcoids, we aim to identify specific microRNAs associated with equine sarcoids. Study design Differential expression of microRNAs was assessed in control equine fibroblasts (EqPalfs) and EqPalfs transformed with the BPV-1 genome (S6-2s). Methods Using a commercially available human microarray, 453 microRNAs were interrogated in RNA samples from both cell lines. Each cell line was analysed in triplicate. Results 219 individual microRNAs were differentially expressed in control (EqPalFs) versus BPV-transformed cells (S6-2s) (P<0.05). of these, 148 microRNAs (68%) were underexpressed in S6-2 cells relative to EqPalfs. Conclusions We have shown that BPV-1 transformed equine cell lines exhibit a different microRNA profile to control equine fibroblasts and the aberrant expression of microRNAs in S6-2 cells can be attributed to the presence of BPV-1 genomes. Our future work will focus on studying the expression profiles of a subset of microRNAs in a larger panel of cell lines and sarcoid tumours to help elucidate the significance of the deregulated expression.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Abstract Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of female death in the world. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently considered to be valuable as noninvasive cancer biomarkers, but their role in the prognosis of cervical cancer has not been elucidated. We aimed to find serum miRNAs that can be used as prognostic factors for cervical cancer. A traumatic pathological biopsy is the only reliable method for determining the severity of cervical cancer currently. Thus, noninvasive diagnostic markers are needed. The serological expression of candidate miRNAs were measured in 90 participants, including 60 patients with cervical cancer and 50 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two patients with cervical cancer were excluded from the study because of lack of data. miRNAs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-143/?4636 appeared specific for cervical cancer compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P?<?.001). The classification performance of validated miRNAs for cervical cancer [Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)?=?0.942] was better than that reached by squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag; AUC?=?0.727). Poor-differentiation group has lower miR-143/?4636 levels in serum (P?<?.05). miR-4636 level was correlated gross tumor volume and the depth of invasion (P?<?.0001). In our study, we found a combination of miR-143 and miR-4636 that is independently and strongly associated with cervical cancer prognosis and can be used as a clinically prognostic factor.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases.

AB  - Abstract Angiogenesis is a vital biological mechanism representing the adaptive response to a variety of pathological stimuli such as hypoxia. It is regulated by several pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic microRNAs. Studies have demonstrated an altered microRNA-185 (miR-185) expression in endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions; however, its role in angiogenesis has not been elucidated. We investigated the role of miR-185 in angiogenesis and found that miR-185 had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) appeared to be a direct target of miR-185 by computational prediction; this was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Silencing of the STIM1 gene was found to mimic miR-185-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis. STIM1 overexpression eliminated the anti-angiogenic effect of miR-185. Our study results suggest a direct interaction between miR-185 and STIM1 mRNA in microvascular endothelial cells. MicroRNA-185 acted as a negative regulator of angiogenesis in microvascular endothelial cells through downregulation of the STIM1 protein.

AB  - Abstract microRNAs are functional, 22 nt, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and Purpose Intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (II/R) injury is a serious clinical problem. Here we have investigated novel mechanisms and new drug targets in II/R injury by searching for microRNAs regulating such injury. Experimental Approach We used hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) of IEC-6 cell cultures and models of II/R models in rats and mice. Microarray assays were used to identify target miRNAs from rat intestinal. Real-time PCR, Western blot and dual luciferase reporter assays, and agomir and antagomir in vitro and in vivo were used to assess the effects of the target miRNA on II/R injury. Key Results The miR-351-5p was differentially expressed in our models and it targeted MAPK13 and sirtuin-6. This miRNA reduced levels of sirtuin-6 and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and activated forkhead box O3 (FoxO3α) phosphorylation to cause oxidative stress. Also, miR-351-5p markedly reduced MAPK13 level, activated polycystic kidney disease 1/NF-?B signal and increased NF-?B (p65). Moreover, miR-351-5p up-regulated levels of Bcl2-associated X, cytochrome c, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1, cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 by reducing sirtuin-6 levels to promote apoptosis. In addition, miR-351-5p mimic in IEC-6 cells and agomir in mice aggravated these effects, and miR-351-5p inhibitor and antagomir in mice alleviated these actions. Conclusions and Implications Our data showed that miR-351-5p aggravated II/R injury by promoting intestinal mucosal oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis by targeting MAPK13 and sirtuin-6.These data provide new insights into the mechanisms regulating II/R injury, and of miR-351-5p could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for such injury.

AB  - Abstract Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the most common causes of neonatal bowel obstruction. Without an early screening and diagnosis, some patients develop serious complications, such as toxic megacolon or acute enterocolitis. We sought to identify specific serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can serve as novel early, non-invasive screening signature and then to test their specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. We obtained serum samples from 95 HSCR cases and 104 matched controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression was performed through TaqMan Low Density Array. The candidate miRNAs were validated by individual reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR arranged in the training and a two-stage validation set. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 23 patients with clinically suspected HSCR to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the serum miRNA profile in predicting HSCR. Following a multi-stage evaluation approach, five miRNAs were significantly increased in HSCR cases compared with controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this five-serum miRNA signature were 0.895, 0.893 and 0.925 in training set and two validation sets, respectively. The accuracy rate of the five-miRNA profile as HSCR signature was 82.6%, which, in the double-blind testing set, was markedly higher than that of contrast enema (70%), the most commonly used test performed to diagnose HSCR. Our results indicate that a five-serum miRNA signature may be linked to HSCR, representing a potential, novel, non-invasive diagnostic approach for early screening of HSCR.

AB  - Abstract Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease due to autoimmune system attacks hepatocytes and causes inflammation and fibrosis. Intracellular signalling and miRNA may play an important role in regulation of liver injury. This study aimed to investigate the potential roles of microRNA 143 in a murine AIH model and a hepatocyte injury model. Murine AIH model was induced by hepatic antigen S100, and hepatocyte injury model was induced by LPS. Mice and AML12 cells were separated into six groups with or without the treatment of miRNA-143. Inflammation and fibrosis as well as gene expression were examined by different cellular and molecular techniques. The model was successfully established with the elevation of ALT and AST as well as inflammatory and fibrotic markers. Infection or transfection of mir-143 in mice or hepatocytes significantly attenuated the development of alleviation of hepatocyte injury. Moreover, the study demonstrated phosphorylation of TAK1-mediated miRNA-143 regulation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis as well as hepatocyte injury. Our studies demonstrated a significant role of miRNA-143 in attenuation of liver injury in AIH mice and hepatocytes. miRNA-143 regulates inflammation and fibrosis through its regulation of TAK1 phosphorylation, which warrants TAK1 as a target for the development of new therapeutic strategy of autoimmune hepatitis.

AB  - Abstract MicroRNA are small non-coding RNA that mediate mRNA translation repression or mRNA degradation, and thereby refine protein expression levels. More than 30?60% of all genes are regulated by microRNA. Exploring disease-related microRNA signatures is an emerging tool in biomarker discovery, and silencing has already been used in a clinical phase 2a trial. As microRNA regulate translation of more than 100 genes, they could also provide a focused insight into important pathways, and offer a better understanding of diseases with heterogeneous pathogenesis. The number of studies investigating microRNA related to multiple sclerosis has increased significantly in recent years. Differentially expressed microRNA have been identified in the whole blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, blood-derived cell subsets and brain lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis. Most studies applied a non-candidate approach of screening by microarray and validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or next generation sequencing; others used a candidate-driven approach. Despite a relatively high number of multiple sclerosis-associated microRNA, just a few could be repeatedly found, even if similar biological materials were examined. Only part of the identified microRNA has been extensively studied, and the biological function has not been explored in the majority. Some of the microRNA related to multiple sclerosis are also differentially expressed in other autoimmune diseases or autoimmune models. In the present review, we discuss microRNA related to disease compartments, activity and phenotype. We also focus on several microRNA with well-defined functions, or because of particular interest due to either validation by several independent studies or in-depth exploration of function.

AB  - Stress is one of the most powerful experiences to influence health and disease. Through epigenetic mechanisms, stress may generate a footprint that propagates to subsequent generations. Programming by prenatal stress or adverse experience in parents, grandparents, or earlier generations may thus be a critical determinant of lifetime health trajectories. Changes in regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) by stress may enhance the vulnerability to certain pathogenic factors. This review explores the hypothesis that miRNAs represent stress-responsive elements in epigenetic regulation that are potentially heritable. Recent findings suggest that miRNAs are key players linking adverse early environments or ancestral stress with disease risk, thus they represent useful predictive disease biomarkers. Since miRNA signatures of disease are potentially heritable, big data management platforms will be vital to harness multi-generational information and capture succinct yet potent biomarkers capable of directing preventative treatments. This feature would offer a unique window of opportunity to advance personalized medicine.
