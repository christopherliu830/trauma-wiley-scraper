AB  - Abstract Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2O2 for 24?hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, ?-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK) and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100??M H2O2-induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2O2 could downregulate circHIPK3. However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2O2 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage and activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.

AB  - Abstract To study the effects of microRNA-98 (miR-98) on human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs). The patients undergoing hip arthroplasty were selected by inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study. The extracted hBMSCs were detected of osteogenic differentiation by alizarin red S staining, and of cell phenotype by flow cytometry. Bioinformatics, dual luciferase report, western blotting, RT-PCR and immunoblotting were used in our study. The hBMSCs were divided into miR-98 mimics, miR-98 negative control (NC), miR-98 inhibitors, Mock and miR-98 inhibitors + siBMP2 groups. Human bone mesenchymal stromal cells were extracted and purified in vitro and had specific cytological morphology, surface markers and abilities of self-renewal and differentiation. Compared with the NC group and Mock group, the miR-98 mimics group showed increased miR-98 level while the miR-98 inhibitors group decreased miR-98 level (both P < 0.01). Dual luciferase reporter showed BMP2 was the target gene of miR-98. The levels of mRNA and protein expression of BMP2, protein expression of RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin content significantly decreased in the miR-98 mimics group while increased in the miR-98 inhibitors group and showed no changes in the NC group and Mock group (all P < 0.05). The miR-98 mimics group showed obviously declined stained red particles and the miR-98 inhibitors group showed opposite result. After lowering the expression of miR-98, osteogenic differentiation ability of hBMSCs rose, which was weakened by the transfection with siBMP2. miR-98 may regulate osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by targeting BMP2.

AB  - ABSTRACT Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIOFH) is a common and devastating orthopedic disease, and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the role of microRNA-34a (mir-34a) in GIOFH. C57 mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with dexamethasone (Dex). A total of 48 adult rats were treated with glucocorticoids, and after the onset of GIOFH, each femoral head was removed. Mir-34a mimics, an inhibitor and over-expressing lentivirus were used in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, cell proliferation assays, osteoblastic differentiation, and endothelial activity assays were employed to evaluate the effect of mir-34a on mMSCs, osteoblasts, and vascular endothelial cells in glucocorticoid-treated mice. We found that Dex inhibited mMSC proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation, as well as the viability and activity of endothelial cells. Dex also caused osteonecrosis and decreased new vessel formation in vivo. Mir-34a alleviated the inhibitory effects of Dex on mMSCs and osteoblasts, while facilitating its inhibitory effects on endothelial cells. Mir-34a is an important regulator in osteogenesis and angiogenesis, and it might be useful as a therapeutic target for GIOFH. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatized muscle, such as that debrided from blast injury sites, is considered a promising and convenient tissue source for multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs), a population of adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells. The present study aimed to assess the regenerative therapeutic potential of human traumatized muscle-derived MPCs, e.g., for injury repair in the blast-traumatized extremity, by comparing their pro-angiogenic potential in vitro and capillary recruitment activity in vivo to those of MSCs isolated from human bone marrow, a widely-used tissue source. MPCs were tested for their direct and indirect effects on human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. The findings reported here showed that MPC-conditioned culture medium (MPC-CM), like MSC-CM, promoted EC-cord network branching. Silent (si)RNA-mediated silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in MPCs attenuated this effect. In a chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane in vivo angiogenesis assay, MPCs encapsulated in photocrosslinked gelatin scaffold recruited blood vessels more efficiently than either MSCs or human foreskin fibroblasts. Together, these findings support the potential application of traumatized muscle-derived MPCs in cell-based regenerative medicine therapies as a result of their influence on EC organization.

AB  - Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common diabetes and has numerous complications. Recent studies demonstrated that T2DM compromises bone fracture healing in which miR-222 might be involved. Furthermore, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3) that is the target of miR-222 accelerates fracture healing. Therefore, we assume that miR-222 could inhibit TIMP-3 expression. Eight-week-old rats were operated femoral fracture or sham, following the injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes one week later in fractured rats, and then, new generated tissues were collected for measuring the expression of miR-222 and TIMP-3. Rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and treated with miR-222 mimic or inhibitor to analyse osteogenic differentiation. MiR-222 was increased in fractured rats and further induced in diabetic rats. In contrast, TIMP-3 was reduced in fractured and further down-regulated in diabetic rats. Luciferase report assay indicated miR-222 directly binds and mediated TIMP-3. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation was suppressed by miR-222 mimic and promoted by miR-222 inhibitor. miR-222 is a key regulator that is promoted in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and it binds to TIMP3 to reduce TIMP-3 expression and suppressed MSCs? differentiation.

AB  - Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) represent a widely used cell source with multi-lineage differentiation capacity in approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the multitude of literature on their differentiation capacity, little is reported about the physiological properties contributing to and controlling the process of lineage differentiation. Direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells via gap junctions has been shown to modulate differentiation processes in other cell types, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most abundant isoform of the gap junction-forming connexins. Thus, in the present study we focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in human ASCs, and its significance for adipogenic differentiation of these cells. Cx43 expression in ASCs was demonstrated histologically and on the gene and protein expression level, and was shown to be greatly positively influenced by cell seeding density. Functionality of gap junctions was proven by dye transfer analysis in growth medium. Adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was shown to be also distinctly elevated at higher cell seeding densities. Inhibition of GJIC by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) significantly compromised adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by histology, triglyceride quantification, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower proportion of cells undergoing adipogenesis when GJIC was inhibited, further indicating the importance of GJIC in the differentiation process. Altogether, this study demonstrates the impact of direct cell?cell communication via gap junctions on the adipogenic differentiation process of ASCs, and may contribute to further integrate direct intercellular crosstalk in rationales for tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - Abstract Susceptibility to PTSD is determined by both genes and environment. Similarly, gene-expression levels in peripheral blood are influenced by both genes and environment, and expression levels of many genes show good correspondence between peripheral blood and brain. Therefore, our objectives were to test the following hypotheses: (1) pre-trauma expression levels of a gene subset (particularly immune-system genes) in peripheral blood would differ between trauma-exposed Marines who later developed PTSD and those who did not; (2) a predictive biomarker panel of the eventual emergence of PTSD among high-risk individuals could be developed based on gene expression in readily assessable peripheral blood cells; and (3) a predictive panel based on expression of individual exons would surpass the accuracy of a model based on expression of full-length gene transcripts. Gene-expression levels were assayed in peripheral blood samples from 50 U.S. Marines (25 eventual PTSD cases and 25 non-PTSD comparison subjects) prior to their deployment overseas to war-zones in Iraq or Afghanistan. The panel of biomarkers dysregulated in peripheral blood cells of eventual PTSD cases prior to deployment was significantly enriched for immune genes, achieved 70% prediction accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of 23 full-length transcripts, and attained 80% accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of one exon from each of five genes. If the observed profiles of pre-deployment mRNA-expression in eventual PTSD cases can be further refined and replicated, they could suggest avenues for early intervention and prevention among individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma and age-related cartilage disorders represent a major global cause of morbidity, resulting in chronic pain and disability in patients. A lack of effective therapies, together with a rapidly aging population, creates an impressive clinical and economic burden on healthcare systems. In this scenario, experimental therapies based on transplantation or in situ stimulation of skeletal Mesenchymal Stem/progenitor Cells (MSCs) have raised great interest for cartilage repair. Nevertheless, the challenge of guiding MSC differentiation and preventing cartilage hypertrophy and calcification still needs to be overcome. While research has mostly focused on the stimulation of cartilage anabolism using growth factors, several issues remain unresolved prompting the field to search for novel solutions. Recently, inhibition of anti-chondrogenic regulators has emerged as an intriguing opportunity. Anti-chondrogenic regulators include extracellular proteins as well as intracellular transcription factors and microRNAs that act as potent inhibitors of pro-chondrogenic signals. Suppression of these inhibitors can enhance MSC chondrogenesis and production of cartilage matrix. We here review the current knowledge concerning different types of anti-chondrogenic regulators. We aim to highlight novel therapeutic targets for cartilage repair and discuss suitable tools for suppressing their anti-chondrogenic functions. Further effort is needed to unveil the therapeutic perspectives of this approach and pave the way for effective treatment of cartilage injuries in patients. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence supports the involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, including autophagy. However, it remains largely unknown as to how autophagy is regulated by miRNAs and lncRNAs in IDD. Biological functions of miR-153-3p and long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 641 (LINC00641) were investigated. Luciferase reporter assays was done to validate miR-153-3p targets. To induce nutritional stress, nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured in the normal nutritional condition and the low nutritional condition. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze miR-153-3p and LINC00641 in response to nutrient deprivation. Autophagic activity was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, western blot analysis and green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 puncta. Pull-down assay and RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization were performed to validate LINC00641 target and the location. MiR-153-3p is downregulated in NP tissues from IDD patients. Further, LINC00641 can affect collagen II and matrix metalloproteinase-3 expressions. Upregulation of LINC00641 and downregulation of miR-153-3p are detected in NP cells under nutritional stress. LINC00641 can regulate autophagic cell death by targeting miR-153-3p and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5). MiR-153-3p inhibits autophagy and IDD by targeting ATG5. More important, LINC00641 targets miR-153-3p, and thus affects ATG5 expression, autophagic cell death and IDD. These findings uncover a novel regulatory pathway that is composed of LINC00641, miR-153-3p, and ATG5 in IDD. This mechanism may stimulate to a more understanding of IDD pathogenesis and provide new sights for the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors.

AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.

AB  - Abstract Stem cells are known to maintain stemness at least in part through secreted factors that promote stem-like phenotypes in resident cells. Accumulating evidence has clarified that stem cells release nano-vesicles, known as exosomes, which may serve as mediators of cell-to-cell communication and may potentially transmit stem cell phenotypes to recipient cells, facilitating stem cell maintenance, differentiation, self-renewal, and repair. It has become apparent that stem cell-derived exosomes mediate interactions among stromal elements, promote genetic instability in recipient cells, and induce malignant transformation. This review will therefore discuss the potential of stem cell-derived exosomes in the context of stromal remodeling and their ability to generate cancer-initiating cells in a tumor niche by inducing morphologic and functional differentiation of fibroblasts into tumor-initiating fibroblasts. In addition, the immunosuppressive potential of stem cell-derived exosomes in cancer immunotherapy and their prospective applications in cell-free therapies in future translational medicine is discussed.

AB  - Aggrecan is a high molecular weight proteoglycan that plays a critical role in cartilage structure and the function of joints, providing intervertebral disc and cartilage with the ability to resist compressive loads. Aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage is a significant event in early-stage osteoarthritis (OA). Currently, no effective treatment exists for OA other than pain relief. Dextrose (D-glucose) prolotherapy has shown promising activity in the treatment of different musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the glucose effect in OA and on the regulation of chondrogenesis. We show for the first time that glucose upregulates aggrecan expression and subsequent chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. Moreover, we found that glucose-induced aggrecan expression is mediated through the protein kinase Cα (PKCα)- and p38-dependent pathway. As demonstrated by microRNA (miR) and luciferase analyses, the glucose-induced PKCα/p38 signaling axis is responsible for downregulating miR141-3p which targets to the 3?untranslated region of aggrecan. In summary, we show that glucose enhances chondrogenesis by upregulating aggrecan expression via the PKCα-p38-miR141-3p signaling pathway. This result provides new insights into the mechanism of glucose on chondrogenesis.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity constitutes the first line of defence against both external and endogenous threats in the brain, and microglia cells are considered key mediators of this process. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a determinant role in the regulation of gene expression during innate immune responses. The major goal of this work was to investigate the contribution of a specific miRNA???miR-155???to the modulation of the microglia-mediated immune response. For this purpose, in vitro studies were performed in N9 microglia cells to evaluate changes in the levels of this miRNA following microglia activation. A strong up-regulation of miR-155 expression was observed following microglia exposure to lipopolysaccharide, which was consistent with a decrease in the levels of the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS-1) protein, a key inhibitor of the inflammatory process and a predicted target of miR-155. The miR-155 knockdown by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides up-regulated SOCS-1 mRNA and protein levels and significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Finally, treatment of neuronal primary cultures with conditioned medium obtained from microglia cells, in which miR-155 was inhibited before cell activation, decreased inflammatory-mediated neuronal cell death. Overall, our results show that miR-155 has a pro-inflammatory role in microglia and is necessary for the progression of the immune response through the modulation of SOCS-1, suggesting that, in a chronic inflammatory context, miR-155 inhibition can have a neuroprotective effect.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal brain malignancy which involves multi-gene abnormality. Unfortunately, effective therapy against GBM remains lacking. Previously, we found that NRP-1 and its downstream NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway played an important role in GBM. In our study, we further investigated the upstream signaling of NRP-1 to understand how it is regulated. First, we identified that hsa-miR-124-3p was miRNA differentially expressed in GBM and in normal brain tissues by high-throughput sequencing. Then, by dual luciferase reporter gene, we found miR-124-3p can specially bind to the 3?UTR region of the NRP-1 thus suppresses its expression. Moreover, miR-124-3p overexpression significantly inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration and tumor angiogenesis which resulted in GBM apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, putatively via NRP-1 mediated PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathways activation in GBM cells. Meanwhile, miR-124-3p overexpression also suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor angiogenesis when targeted by NRP-1 in a PDX model. Furthermore, NRP-1 mAb exerted synergistic inhibitory effects with miR-124-3p overexpression in GBM. Thus, we discovered that miR-124-3p acts as the upstream suppressor of NRP-1 which promotes GBM cell development and growth by PI3K/Akt/NF?B pathway. The miR-124-3p/NRP-1/GIPC1 pathway as a new pathway has a vital role in GBM, and it could be considered as the potential target for malignant gliomas in future.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - ABSTRACT Glioma is one of the most aggressive and malignant tumor types. Despite advances in surgery, imaging, chemotherapy, and radiation, glioma patient prognosis remains poor. Glioma pathogenesis is an urgent problem that must be solved. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miRNA deregulation commonly occurs in human tumorigenesis. In the present study, the expression levels of Let-7f were down-regulated in both glioma tissues and glioma cells. The enhanced expression of Let-7f suppressed glioma cells proliferation, migration, and invasion via direct targeting perisotin oncogenic activity. Experiments with periostin siRNA or over-expression further suggest that Let-7f may serve as tumor suppressors through perisotin signal. These findings provide insights regarding the role and mechanism of Let-7f in regulating biological behavior of glioma cells via the Let-7f/periostin axis, and Let-7f may serve as a potential therapeutic target in glioma.
