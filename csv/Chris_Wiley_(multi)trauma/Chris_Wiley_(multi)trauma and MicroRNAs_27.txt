AB  - Abstract Over the past 2 decades evolutionary perspectives have come to play an increasingly important role in theoretical formulations concerning the various forms of psychopathology. Efforts to understand how early adversity can shape life trajectories that impact mental and physical health are gaining momentum across a board range of scientific disciplines, extending beyond child development to genetics and epigenetics, developmental neurobiology, cognitive and social neuroscience, and neuroimmunology. Evolutionary theories concerning specific forms of psychopathology have also been formulated. Despite their conceptual value and explanatory value, evolution-based hypotheses are difficult to test. Nevertheless, evolutionary perspectives have to be of great value in shaping conceptualizations of developmental psychopathology and they are beginning to inform clinical practice across the entire life span.

AB  - Abstract Objective Previously, we have shown that miRNA-342-3p was increased during osteogenic differentiation of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) via regulating the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In this study, our objective is to further investigate the role of miRNA-342-3p in activation of Shh pathway by targeting suppressor of fused protein (Sufu), a suppressor of transcriptional factor Gli, as well as the potential interaction with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) signaling pathway during osteogenic induction of hUCMSCs. Materials and methods HUCMSCs that stable overexpression or knockdown of miRNA-342-3p were established by infection with lentiviral vectors. mRNA and protein levels of Hedgehog signaling pathway and osteogenic genes were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot assays. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to test the direct binding site of Sufu 5?UTR targeted by miRNA-342-3p. Results Overexpression of miRNA-342-3p in hUCMSCs enhanced the expression of osteogenic genes by targeting Sufu. And the potential of osteogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs was inhibited while knocking down miRNA-342-3p. Meanwhile, induced the TGF-? expression level was also observed upon overexpressing miRNA-342-3p, suggesting activation of TGF-? signaling pathway was a potential mechanism of miRNA-342-3p-mediated osteogenesis in hUCMSCs. Conclusions Our findings provide new mechanistic evidence that miRNA-342-3p might be a valuable therapeutic target in bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease with multifactorial etiology caused by risk factors. The degradation of aggrecan by upregulated ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) is the key event in the development of OA. ADAMTS-4 contributes to aggrecan degradation in human OA. Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61), which is associated with diseases related to chronic inflammation, is found in articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis and appears to suppress ADAMTS-4 activity, possibly leading to chondrocyte cloning. Herein, we first revealed that Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 protein levels were remarkably increased in OA cartilage tissues and OA chondrocytes, and verified Cyr61 regulation of ADAMTS-4 in normal and OA chondrocyte. Further, we revealed that Cyr61 could promote OA chondrocyte proliferation through inhibiting ADAMTS-4. Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines plays a vital role in the pathological development of OA; herein, we demonstrated that IL-1? inhibited Cyr61, while promoted ADAMTS-4 expression. By using online tools and luciferase assays, we confirmed that miR-34a, a regulatory miRNA of chondrocyte proliferation, could directly bind to the 3?-UTR of Cyr61 to inhibit its expression; further, IL-1? regulated Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 expression through miR-34a. In OA cartilage tissues, miR-34a, and IL-1? mRNA expression was up-regulated and positively correlated; miR-34a and Cyr61 mRNA was positively correlated, further indicating that suppressing miR-34a expression might rescue IL-1?-induced Cyr61 suppression, and promote OA chondrocyte proliferation. Taken together, we provided novel experimental basis for rescuing OA chondrocyte proliferation through miR-34a/Cyr61 axis.

AB  - ABSTRACT P4 medicine is an evolving approach to personalized medicine. The four Ps offer a means to: Predict who will develop disease and co-morbidities; Prevent rather than react to disease; Personalize diagnosis and treatment; have patients Participate in their own care. P4 medicine is very applicable to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) because each OSA patient has a different pathway to disease and its consequences. OSA has both structural and physiological mechanisms with different clinical subgroups, different molecular profiles and different consequences. This may explain why there are different responses to alternative therapies, such as intraoral devices and hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy. Currently, technology facilitates patients to participate in their own care from screening for OSA (snoring and apnoea apps) to monitoring response to therapy (sleep monitoring, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate) as well as monitoring their own continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance. We present a conceptual framework that provides the basis for a new, P4 medicine approach to OSA and should be considered more in depth: predict and prevent those at high risk for OSA and consequences, personalize the diagnosis and treatment of OSA and build in patient participation to manage OSA.
