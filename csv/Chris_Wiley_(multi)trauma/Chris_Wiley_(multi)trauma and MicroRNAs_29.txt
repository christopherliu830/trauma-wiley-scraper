AB  - Abstract An exponential increase in the prevalence of neurological disorders requires substantial steps to be taken for their prevention and treatment. Neurodiagnostic biomarkers are gaining momentum presently in order to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenerative disorders, to precisely assess their advancement and to monitor the efficiency of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the primary focus of the present review is the recent development in this field of neurodiagnostic biomarkers, and the current state of biomarker exploration in the context of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses an updated and detailed account of specific (?-Amyloid, Tau and Phospho-tau 181, Tar-DNA binding protein-43, Progranulin, a-synuclein, Clusterin, etc) and non-specific (genetic, synaptic, inflammatory and coagulation) neurodiagnostic biomarkers and the recent advances in this growing field. This comprehensive review also suggests the utilization of neurodiagnostic markers in network approaches and personalized medication that will eventually improvise the existing diagnostic and therapeutic complexities of neurodiagnostic biomarkers.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, we investigate the impact of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in scaffold-based tissue engineering and its potential for tissue regenerative medicine. Scaffold-based tissue engineering aims to develop functionalized tissues/organs for repair and regeneration of damaged or diseased body parts by employing engineered matrices called scaffolds cultured with cells and bioactive molecules. iPSCs are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed into an embryonic-cell-like state. Owing to their unique regenerative capacity, iPSCs have attracted the attention of the biomedical community and demonstrated their capability as an invaluable cell source for cell therapy and for scaffold-based tissue engineering. However, the underlying mechanism of the interaction of iPSCs with three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds is unclear, which is very essential to realize the full potential of iPSCs in engineering functional tissues and organs. In this chapter, we therefore review the impact of iPSCs in scaffold-based tissue engineering and its potential for tissue regenerative medicine. The techniques employed for the culture of iPSCs into 3D scaffolds, the effect of the 3D microenvironment in controlling iPSCs' fate and function, and the potential applications of iPSCs in tissue engineering are discussed with illustrated examples. The chapter is expected to be useful for readers to gain insight into the impact of iPSCs in various 3D scaffold-based tissue engineering fields such as bone, cartilage, cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering.

AB  - The antioxidant effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) contribute substantially to the health benefits of this compound. Resveratrol has been shown to be a scavenger of a number of free radicals. However, the direct scavenging activities of resveratrol are relatively poor. The antioxidant properties of resveratrol in vivo are more likely to be attributable to its effect as a gene regulator. Resveratrol inhibits NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS by down-regulating the expression and activity of the oxidase. This polyphenolic compound reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation by stimulating mitochondria biogenesis. Resveratrol prevents superoxide production from uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase by up-regulating the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. In addition, resveratrol increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes. Some of the gene-regulating effects of resveratrol are mediated by the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 or by the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2. In this review article, we have also summarized the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol observed in clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract It is well known that neurogenesis is not the only concern for the fully functional recovery after brain or spinal cord injury, as it has been shed light on the critical role of angiogenesis in improving neurological functional recovery. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis coordinately interact with each other in the developing and adult brain, during which they may respond to similar mediators and receptors, in which they share a common posttranscriptional regulator: the miR-17?92 cluster. The miR-17?92 cluster was initially described as an oncogene and was later demonstrated to drive key physiological and pathological responses during development and diseases respectively. It has been reported that the miR-17?92 cluster regulates both neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The miR-17?92 cluster modulates neural progenitor cells proliferation not only during development but also during neurological disorders such as stroke. It has also been shown that the endothelial miR-17?92 cluster regulates angiogenesis during embryonic stage and adulthood. In this review, we have discussed the actions of the miR-17?92 cluster in neuronal and vascular plasticity, and its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CNS injury. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
