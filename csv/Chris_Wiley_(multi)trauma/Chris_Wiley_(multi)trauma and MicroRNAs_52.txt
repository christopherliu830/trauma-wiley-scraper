AB  - Summary Most infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women escape HIV infection. Infants evade infection despite an immature immune system and, in the case of breastfeeding, prolonged repetitive exposure. If infants become infected, the course of their infection and response to treatment differs dramatically depending upon the timing (in utero, intrapartum, or during breastfeeding) and potentially the route of their infection. Perinatally acquired HIV infection occurs during a critical window of immune development. HIV's perturbation of this dynamic process may account for the striking age-dependent differences in HIV disease progression. HIV infection also profoundly disrupts the maternal immune system upon which infants rely for protection and immune instruction. Therefore, it is not surprising that infants who escape HIV infection still suffer adverse effects. In this review, we highlight the unique aspects of pediatric HIV transmission and pathogenesis with a focus on mechanisms by which HIV infection during immune ontogeny may allow discovery of key elements for protection and control from HIV.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reduced oxygen (O2) levels (hypoxia) are present during embryogenesis and exposure to altitude and in pathologic conditions. During embryogenesis, myogenic progenitor cells reside in a hypoxic micro environment, which may regulate their activity. Satellite cells are myogenic progenitor cells localized in a local environment, suggesting that the O2 level could affect their activity during muscle regeneration. In this review, we present the idea that O2 levels regulate myogenesis and muscle regeneration, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms under lying myogenesis and muscle regeneration in hypoxia and depict the rapeutic strategies using changes in O2 levels to promote muscle regeneration. Severe hypoxia (£1% O2) appears detrimental for myogenic differentiation in vitro, whereas a 3?6%O2 level could promotemyogenesis. Hypoxia impairs the regenerative capacity of injured muscles. Although it remains to be explored, hypoxia may contribute to the muscle damage observed in patients with pathologies associated with hypoxia (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral arterial disease). Hypoxia affects satellite cell activity andmyogenesis throughmechanismsdependent and independent of hypoxiainducible factor-1a. Finally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and transplantation of hypoxia-conditionedmyoblasts are beneficial procedures to enhance muscle regeneration in animals. These therapies may be clinically relevant to treatment of patientswith severemuscle damage.?Chaillou, T. Lanner, J.T.

AB  - Summary Objective Current medications for patients with epilepsy work in only two of three patients. For those medications that do work, they only suppress seizures. They treat the symptoms, but do not modify the underlying disease, forcing patients to take these drugs with significant side effects, often for the rest of their lives. A major limitation in our ability to advance new therapeutics that permanently prevent, reduce the frequency of, or cure epilepsy comes from a lack of understanding of the disease coupled with a lack of reliable biomarkers that can predict who has or who will get epilepsy. Methods The main goal of this report is to present a number of approaches for identifying reliable biomarkers from observing patients with brain disorders that have a high probability of producing epilepsy. Results A given biomarker, or more likely a profile of biomarkers, will have both a quantity and a time course during epileptogenesis that can be used to predict who will get the disease, to confirm epilepsy as a diagnosis, to identify coexisting pathologies, and to monitor the course of treatments. Significance Additional studies in patients and animal models could identify common and clinically valuable biomarkers to successfully translate animal studies into new and effective clinical trials.

AB  - Summary The alimentary tract includes the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, intestine, and rectum. These structures all share the same basic structure and consist of an epithelial-lined cavity supported by a submucosa. This submucosa is surrounded by bone in parts of the oral cavity and by muscle in the rest of tract. Because of this consistent basic structure, tumors that develop within the tubular alimentary tract can be subdivided into those of the epithelium and those that develop within the supporting mesenchymal tissue. Cancer staging requires assessment of regional lymph nodes for the presence of metastases. Papillomas of the oral cavity can be subdivided into squamous papillomas that are benign neoplasms and viral papillomas that are hyperplastic lesions caused by papillomavirus infection. Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common oral neoplasm of cats, horses, and the production animal species. They are the second most common malignant oral neoplasm of dogs.

AB  - Summary The advent of molecular genetic techniques and successful cell culture of the organism towards the end of the 20th century substantially accelerated the understanding of the causative organism, Tropheryma whipplei, and by extension, the underlying clinical condition. Whipple's disease usually is diagnosed at an advanced stage and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations. In classic Whipple's disease small-bowel biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. The effectiveness of antimicrobials, especially poorly absorbed antibiotics, as the mainstay for treating tropical sprue establishes the central role of enteric bacteria/bacterial overgrowth in the condition. Mycotic infections usually arise from disseminated pulmonary infections and occur usually, but not exclusively, in immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis for all mycotic infections of the small intestine is similar and includes other mycotic infections, Crohn's disease, tuberculosis (TB) enteritis, disseminated mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), bacterial typhlitis, intestinal ischemia and carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a large group of viruses (more than 200 types identified) that infect the epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes. The infections can be latent, subclinical, or clinically manifest, causing lesions that range from the benign (warts, papillomas, condylomas) to the malignant. Some of these viruses are responsible for cutaneous warts; a different group of HPVs (types 6 and 11) is responsible for most genital warts. The major importance of HPVs is because 20 types (especially HPV-16 and -18) are regarded as the necessary, if not sufficient, cause of cervical cancer as well as other cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx. Although most sexually active individuals get infected with genital HPVs, most of these infections are transient and innocuous. It is the persistence of the high-risk oncogenic HPVs that leads to malignant transformation. Cancer caused by these viruses is preceded by a precancerous stage whose detection is the basis of cytologic screening (Pap smear) for cervical cancer. Ten years ago HPV vaccines were introduced for the prevention of diseases associated with HPV-16 and -18 and for the prevention of anogenital warts caused by HPV-6 and -11. The introduction of HPV vaccination has been a major advance because it is the first time a vaccine has been able to directly prevent virally induced cancers. When used broadly before the onset of sexual activity, HPV vaccination has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of genital warts and HPV-related cervical lesions. This should be the harbinger of a decline in the rates of cervical and other cancers.
