AB  - Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the genus Hepacivirus in the Flaviviridae family (1), is a single-stranded RNA virus that infects humans and other higher primates, and has a selective tropism to the liver. Following exposure, HCV is able to evade the host's immune system and establish a chronic, often asymptomatic, infection that may lead to liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Transmitted primarily by exposure to infected blood, but also through sexual and perinatal routes, the virus is estimated to infect 2.8% of the world's population (2). Originally termed non-A, non-B hepatitis, infection with HCV was a frequent cause of transfusion-related hepatitis until discovery of the virus in 1989 (3, 4) and the subsequent development of effective screening methods. Many substantial advances have recently been made in treating HCV infection, and it is now possible to cure over 90% of patients with HCV infection. These advances also provide promising opportunities for future public health efforts to effectively reduce the disease burden of this global infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), are examples of chronic (RCT and CTS) and acute (ACL ruptures) musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. These injuries are multifactorial in nature, with several identified intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Previous studies have implicated specific sequence variants within genes encoding structural and regulatory components of the extracellular matrix of tendons and/ligaments to predispose individuals to these injuries. An example, includes the association of sequence variants within the apoptotic regulatory gene, caspase-8 (CASP8) with other musculoskeletal injury phenotypes, such as Achilles tendinopathy. The primary aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate previously implicated DNA sequence variants within CASP8: rs3834129 (ins/del) and rs1045485 (G/C), and the rs13113 (T/A) identified using a whole exome sequencing approach, with risk of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes (RCT, ACL ruptures, and CTS) in three independent studies. In addition, the aim was to implicate a CASP8 genomic interval in the modulation of risk of RCT, ACL ruptures, or CTS. It was found that the AA genotype of CASP8 rs13113 (T/A) was independently associated with increased risk for CTS. In addition, it was found that the del-C haplotype (rs3834129?rs1045485) was significantly associated with non-contact ACL ruptures, which is in alignment with previous research findings. Collectively, the results of this study implicate the apoptosis pathway as biologically significant in the underlying pathogenesis of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes. These findings should be repeated in larger sample cohorts and across different populations. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 38:680?688, 2020

AB  - Abstract CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RNAi knock down of CDK5 reduced the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and prevented neuronal loss in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice. Here, we report that CDK5 RNAi protected against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity using primary hippocampal neurons transduced with adeno-associated virus 2.5 viral vector eGFP-tagged scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR during 12 days. Protection was dependent on a concomitant increase in p35 and was reversed using p35 RNAi, which affected the down-stream Rho GTPase activity. Furthermore, p35 over-expression and constitutively active Rac1 mimicked CDK5 silencing-induced neuroprotection. In addition, 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease mice (24 months old) were injected in the hippocampus with scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR, and spatial learning and memory were performed 3 weeks post-injection using ?Morris? water maze test. Our data showed that CDK5 knock down induced an increase in p35 protein levels and Rac activity in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice, which correlated with the recovery of cognitive function; these findings confirm that increased p35 and active Rac are involved in neuroprotection. In summary, our data suggest that p35 acts as a mediator of Rho GTPase activity and contributes to the neuroprotection induced by CDK5 RNAi. CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that p35/Rac1 signaling is critical in the CDK5 shRNAmiR-induced neuroprotection against glutamate neurotoxicity and is also correlated with the recovery of cognitive function in 3xTg-AD mice. CDK5 shRNAmiR blocks calpain activation, and the cleavage of p35 to p25 produced by glutamate, which generates neuroprotection in a p35 up-regulation dependent mode and its down-stream control of Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses two main groups of enzymes, namely those involved in cell signalling and those that perform a number of protein modifications, such as glycosylation. The signalling enzymes include protein kinases and phosphatases, cyclases and phosphodiesterases, also an extensive group of small GTP-binding proteins. Some lipid kinases and phosphatases relating to inositol signalling are listed with the protein kinases and protein phosphatases, respectively. Lastly, the 'other signalling enzymes' list entries (prenyltransferases and phospholipases for example), that do not readily fit into the other categories. The protein modification enzymes are involved in protein synthesis and folding, as well as breakdown by peptidases and their inhibitors. There are also sections devoted to glycosylation, ubiquitylation (and related) modifications as well as specific (epigenetic) modifications to chromatin proteins. The section on 'other protein modifications' includes such diverse enzymes as the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, transglutaminases and tubulin tyrosine ligases.

AB  - Abstract In 2013, EFSA published a literature review on epidemiological studies linking exposure to pesticides and human health outcome. As a follow up, the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their residues (PPR Panel) was requested to investigate the plausible involvement of pesticide exposure as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and childhood leukaemia (CHL). A systematic literature review on PD and CHL and mode of actions for pesticides was published by EFSA in 2016 and used as background documentation. The Panel used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to define the biological plausibility in relation to epidemiological studies by means of identification of specific symptoms of the diseases as AO. The AOP combines multiple information and provides knowledge of biological pathways, highlights species differences and similarities, identifies research needs and supports regulatory decisions. In this context, the AOP approach could help in organising the available experimental knowledge to assess biological plausibility by describing the link between a molecular initiating event (MIE) and the AO through a series of biologically plausible and essential key events (KEs). As the AOP is chemically agnostic, tool chemical compounds were selected to empirically support the response and temporal concordance of the key event relationships (KERs). Three qualitative and one putative AOP were developed by the Panel using the results obtained. The Panel supports the use of the AOP framework to scientifically and transparently explore the biological plausibility of the association between pesticide exposure and human health outcomes, identify data gaps, define a tailored testing strategy and suggests an AOP's informed Integrated Approach for Testing and Assessment (IATA).
