AB  - Abstract The ability to regenerate organs and appendages is not universal among animals. Humans have a rather limited capacity to regenerate after an injury, while other vertebrates such as the zebrafish are capable of regenerating many anatomical structures. It is unknown why different vertebrates have such differences in regenerative capacity, so studying animal models that do regenerate will allow us to know what is needed to regenerate. Zebrafish research is not only able to tell us what mechanisms are involved in regeneration, but it also shows us that there are different regeneration strategies: some use stem cells while other create progenitors from differentiated tissue cells. This article details how zebrafish uses and regulates either differentiated tissue cells or stem cells to regenerate. We focus on four structures ? fin appendage, brain, spinal cord and heart ? and describe how current cell and molecular discoveries from these regenerating fish structures contribute to our understanding of general principles of regenerative biology. Key Concepts The zebrafish is a remarkable in vivo model to understand the stem/progenitor cell biology and molecular mechanisms involved in appendage and organ regeneration. Studying how the zebrafish regenerates its fins, its nervous system and its heart will provide information on how endogenous cell populations (whether fully differentiated or stem cells) are activated and concertedly controlled to regenerate compound structures. Different zebrafish tissues use different strategies to regenerate: some convert differentiated tissue cells to progenitor cells while other draw from stem cell pools. Zebrafish appendages and hearts regenerate primarily from the residual differentiated tissues. Zebrafish nervous tissue regenerates from resident stem cell populations.

AB  - Abstract Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor 1 (PAC1-R) is the neuropeptide PACAP-preferring receptor-mediating neuroprotective activity. In order to clarify the biological mechanism of its expression, we cloned the 2,526 bp promoter fragment from ?2,500 to +26 of the transcription initiation site of human ADCYAP1R1 gene and constructed the novel promotor reporter system named pYr-PromDetect-PAC1p. It was found in SH-SY5Y cells low concentration (<10 nM) of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly promoted the activity of PAC1-R promoter in dose-dependent way, which was significantly inhibited by the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1) inhibitor mithramycin A and was further confirmed in the deletion mutation of the predicted SP1 binding sites. Moreover, higher concentration of H2O2 (>10 nM) inhibited the activity of PAC1-R in dose-dependent way. The hormesis effect of H2O2 on PAC1-R promoter would help to further clarify the physiological effect of low-dose reactive oxygen on nervous system. Practical applications PAC1-R mediates well-known neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and neurogenesis effects, which is an important drug target for neurodegenerative diseases. The hormesis effects of oxidative stress on PAC1-R expression not only help to explain the hormesis effects of oxidative stress on nerve system, but also offer a novel strategy to increase the expression of PAC1-R for the nerve protection or nerve generation. For example, taking advantage of low degree of oxidative stress to increases the expression of PAC1-R might help prevent subsequent surgical serious injury on the nervous system. The activation of PAC1-R promoter by low concentration of H2O2 would help to further clarify the physiological effect of low-dose reactive oxygen on nervous system.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adipose tissue, bone marrow, cord blood, and other tissues, have recently attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in various diseases because of their trans-differentiation capacity. However, recent studies have suggested that MSCs also appear to contribute to tumor pathogenesis by supporting tumor microenvironments, increasing tumor growth, and eliciting antitumor immune responses. Although some studies suggest that MSCs have inhibitory effects on tumor development, they are overwhelmed by a number of studies showing that MSCs exert stimulatory effects on tumor pathogenesis. In the present review, we summarize a number of findings to provide current information about the therapeutic potential of MSCs in various diseases. We then discuss the potential roles of MSCs in tumor progression.

AB  - Abstract EFSA received a request from the Hellenic Food Authority (EFET) for a scientific opinion on the risk to human health from the presence of nickel (Ni) in food, particularly in vegetables. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) decided to extend the risk assessment also to drinking water. The reproductive and developmental toxicity in experimental animals was selected as the critical effect for the assessment of chronic effects of Ni. A tolerable daily intake of 2.8 µg Ni/kg body weight (b.w.) per day was derived from a lower 95 % confidence limit for a benchmark dose at 10 % extra risk (BMDL10) of 0.28 mg/kg b.w. for post-implantation fetal loss in rats. The current dietary exposure to Ni raises concern when considering the mean and 95th percentile chronic exposure levels for all different age groups. The systemic contact dermatitis (SCD) elicited in Ni-sensitive humans after oral exposure to Ni was selected as the critical effect suitable for the assessment of acute effects of Ni. A lowest BMDL10 of 1.1 µg Ni/kg b.w. was derived for the incidence of SCD following oral exposure to Ni of human volunteers. The CONTAM Panel applied a margin of exposure (MOE) approach and considered an MOE of 10 to be indicative of a low health concern. The MOEs calculated considering the estimated mean and the 95th percentile acute exposure levels were considerably below 10 for all age groups. Overall, the CONTAM Panel concluded that, at the current levels of acute dietary exposure to Ni, there is a concern that Ni-sensitized individuals may develop eczematous flare-up skin reactions. The CONTAM Panel noted the need for mechanistic studies to assess the human relevance of the effects on reproduction and development observed in experimental animals and for additional studies on human absorption of nickel from food, for example in combination with duplicate diet studies.

AB  - Abstract The alphaviruses are principally mosquito-borne, positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Togaviridae that exhibit a broad range of pathogenicity in humans and animals (1, 2). Members of the genus are distributed worldwide in diverse ecological niches, where they are usually maintained in cycles between mosquitoes and birds or mammals. While human infections generally are incidental to the transmission cycles, in some instances human-mosquito-human cycles can maintain transmission and lead to large outbreaks and epidemics. Among the 24 alphaviruses listed in Table 1, 16 have been associated with human illness. Clinically, these manifest most commonly as polyarthralgia, often accompanied by fever and/or rash, or as central nervous system (CNS) infections. In addition to the alphaviruses circulating between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, a single example of an alphavirus, restricted to mosquitoes, has recently been described, Eilat virus (EILV) (3), and there are two known aquatic species, southern elephant seal virus (SESV) and salmon pancreatic disease virus (SPDV), that are likely to have lice as vectors (4, 5). This chapter reviews general aspects of the virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention of the alphavirus infections, followed by more detailed discussion of those that cause human disease.

AB  - Summary Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer predisposing condition caused by germline mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the TP53 transcription factor. LFS is typified by the development of a wide spectrum of childhood and adult-onset malignancies, which includes, among others, the lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and, to a lesser extent, lymphoma. Accordingly, it is important that haematologists/oncologists be familiar with this pleiotropic hereditary cancer syndrome. The high cancer risk and variability in type and age of cancer onset have raised questions about the underlying biology and optimal treatment approaches for individuals with LFS. Since its description almost 50 years ago, many clinical and basic research investigations have provided insights into the pathogenesis, manifestations, genetic testing and management strategies for individuals with LFS. Here we provide an update on the current state of knowledge regarding LFS with an emphasis, where possible, on information relevant to practicing haematologists.

AB  - Abstract Cerebrovascular disease involves various medical disorders that obstruct brain blood vessels or deteriorate cerebral circulation, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Nowadays, platinum coils with or without biological modification have become routine embolization devices to reduce the risk of cerebral aneurysm bleeding. Additionally, many intracranial stents, flow diverters, and stent retrievers have been invented with uniquely designed structures. To accelerate the translation of these devices into clinical usage, an in-depth understanding of the mechanical and material performance of these metal-based devices is critical. However, considering the more distal location and tortuous anatomic characteristics of cerebral arteries, present devices still risk failing to arrive at target lesions. Consequently, more flexible endovascular devices and novel designs are under urgent demand to overcome the deficiencies of existing devices. Herein, the pros and cons of the current structural designs are discussed when these devices are applied to the treatment of diseases ranging broadly from hemorrhages to ischemic strokes, in order to encourage further development of such kind of devices and investigation of their use in the clinic. Moreover, novel biodegradable materials and drug elution techniques, and the design, safety, and efficacy of personalized devices for further clinical applications in cerebral vasculature are discussed.
