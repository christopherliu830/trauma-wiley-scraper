AB  - Abstract Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, provide a powerful platform for mechanistic studies of disorders of neurodevelopment and neural networks. hPSC models of autism, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders are also advancing the path toward designing and testing precision therapies. The field is evolving rapidly with the addition of genome-editing approaches, expanding protocols for the two-dimensional (2D) differentiation of different neuronal subtypes, and three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid cultures. However, the application of these techniques to study complex neurological disorders, including the epilepsies, remains a challenge. Here, we review previous work using both 2D and 3D hPSC models of genetic epilepsies, as well as recent advances in the field. We also describe new strategies for applying these technologies to disease modeling of genetic epilepsies, and discuss current challenges and future directions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Amyloids are primarily known for their roles in neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in systemic diseases like diabetes. Evolutionary forces tend to maintain a healthy set of heritable characteristics, while eliminating toxic or unfavourable elements; but amyloids seem to represent an exception to this fundamental concept. In addition to their presence in mammals, amyloids also persist in the proteome of many lower organisms that may be linked with possible roles in survival, which are still unexplored. Herein, we address some unanswered questions regarding amyloids: are these well-structured proteinaceous aggregates a by-product of inefficient folding events, or have they been retained in our protein repertoire for as yet unknown functional roles; and how do protein misfolding and associated disorders originate, despite the presence of protein quality-control systems inside the cells? This review aims to extend our current understanding about the multifaceted useful properties of amyloids and their functional interactions with other molecular pathways in various species; this may provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Summary The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines and receptors is unique in immunology because the IL-1 family and Toll-like receptor (TLR) families share similar functions. More than any other cytokine family, the IL-1 family is primarily associated with innate immunity. More than 95% of living organisms use innate immune mechanisms for survival whereas less than 5% depend on T- and B-cell functions. Innate immunity is manifested by inflammation, which can function as a mechanism of host defense but when uncontrolled is detrimental to survival. Each member of the IL-1 receptor and TLR family contains the cytoplasmic Toll-IL-1-Receptor (TIR) domain. The 50 amino acid TIR domains are highly homologous with the Toll protein in Drosophila. The TIR domain is nearly the same and present in each TLR and each IL-1 receptor family. Whereas IL-1 family cytokine members trigger innate inflammation via IL-1 family of receptors, TLRs trigger inflammation via bacteria, microbial products, viruses, nucleic acids, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In fact, IL-1 family member IL-1a and IL-33 also function as DAMPs. Although the inflammatory properties of the IL-1 family dominate in innate immunity, IL-1 family member can play a role in acquired immunity. This overview is a condensed update of the IL-1 family of cytokines and receptors.

AB  - Summary For cellular signal transduction research to reach its potential in toxicology and pharmacology, it is necessary to bridge the gap between early responses and end disease states. From the lessons learned in the drug development, it appears that there is much more research to be done before one can fully capitalize on cellular signal transduction research and translate it into clinical practice. Future research endeavors should seek to understand the spatial and temporal dependence of second messengers, as examples demonstrate the power that real-time, visual insights can provide to the field. Crosstalk is a form of signal integration, where seemingly independent signaling cascades are able to alter each other in response to stimulus. In order to improve the understanding of crosstalk, one must identify potential targets, including all of the potential sites that are available for posttranslational modifications. In the last few decades, nutrition research has undergone a dramatic transformation.

AB  - Abstract The genetic heritage for decades has been considered to respond only to gene promoters or suppressors, with specific roles for oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Epigenetics is progressively attracting increasing interest because it has demonstrated the capacity of these regulatory processes to regulate the gene expression without modifying gene sequence. Several factors may influence epigenetics, such as lifestyles including food selection. A role for physical exercise is emerging in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In this review, we resume physiological and pathological implications of epigenetic modification induced by the physical activity (PA). Inflammation and cancer mechanisms, immune system, central nervous system, and the aging process receive benefits due to PA through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, the modulation of epigenetic processes by physical exercise positively influences prevention, development, and the course of inflammatory and cancer diseases, as well as neurodegenerative illnesses. This growing field of studies gives rise to a new role for PA as an option in prevention strategies and to integrate pharmacological therapeutic treatments.
