Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and p38 ?? Concluding remarks Post-natal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle is highly dependent on a population of resident myogenic precursors known as satellite cells. Transcription factors from the Pax gene family, Pax3 and Pax7, are critical for satellite cell biogenesis, survival and potentially self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. This is particularly true in the case of Pax7, which appears to regulate myogenesis at multiple levels. Accordingly, recent data have highlighted the importance of a functional relationship between Pax7 and the MyoD family of muscle regulatory transcription factors during normal muscle formation and disease. Here we will critically review key findings suggesting that Pax7 may play a dual role by promoting resident muscle progenitors to commit to the skeletal muscle lineage while preventing terminal differentiation, thus keeping muscle progenitors poised to differentiate upon environmental cues. In addition, potential regulatory mechanisms for the control of Pax7 activity will be proposed.

AB  - Abstract Environmental conditions can have a lasting epigenetic impact on development, and there is increasing evidence that these effects can be transmitted across generations. Evidence for parental transmission of epigenetic variation to offspring has been primarily focused on paternal epigenetic influences induced by a male's experience of nutritional, social and toxicological exposures. There is an assumption in the literature that paternal influence on offspring in non-biparental species is mediated exclusively through epigenetic transmission via the germline. However, integration of concepts from behavioural ecology into the study of parental transmission of environmental effects reveals the importance of mating tactics and maternal?paternal interplay in shaping resource allocation towards offspring in considering the mechanism(s) of epigenetic transmission. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding paternal epigenetic germline effects, the interplay between maternal and paternal influences and the importance of considering the complex nature of reproduction when predicting the transmission of phenotype across generations. Further, this paper highlights how incorporating concepts from behavioural ecology into the study of epigenetic transmission can refine predictions of phenotypes that emerge and create a more integrated notion of development and inheritance. It is proposed that theoretical and methodological approaches that consider the impact of reproductive context, which include mating dynamics, fertility, variation in parental life history and assessment of maternal effects, could improve the predictions made within studies of paternal epigenetic effects on offspring development.

AB  - The International Transplant Skin Cancer Collaborative (ITSCC) is an organization of more than 300 members dedicated to the study and care of skin changes that develop in solid-organ transplant recipients. This group of medical and surgical dermatologists, transplant surgeons and basic science researchers was formed to better understand the basic science of transplant dermatology, and to work collaboratively to address the clinical challenges in this patient population. Transplant patients have an ?100-fold increased risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma than the general population and are also at an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. In October 2010, ITSCC and its European counterpart Skin Care in Organ Transplant Patients Europe (SCOPE) held a joint biennial 4-day scientific retreat in the woods near Essex, Massachusetts. In this meeting report we provide an up-to-date distillation of the novel findings presented in the 21 oral abstracts, at the tumor board and within the working groups.

AB  - Our aim is to present a working model that may serve as a valuable heuristic to predict enduring effects of drugs when administered during development. Our primary tenet is that a greater understanding of neurodevelopment can lead to improved treatment that intervenes early in the progression of a given disorder and prevents symptoms from manifesting. The immature brain undergoes significant changes during the transitions between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Such changes in innervation, neurotransmitter levels, and their respective signaling mechanisms have profound and observable changes on typical behavior, but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders when the maturational process goes awry. Given the remarkable plasticity of the immature brain to adapt to its external milieu, preventive interventions may be possible. We intend for this review to initiate a discussion of how currently used psychotropic agents can influence brain development. Drug exposure during sensitive periods may have beneficial long-term effects, but harmful delayed consequences may be possible as well. Regardless of the outcome, this information needs to be used to improve or develop alternative approaches for the treatment of childhood disorders. With this framework in mind, we present what is known about the effects of stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics on brain maturation (including animal studies that use more clinically-relevant dosing paradigms or relevant animal models). We endeavor to provocatively set the stage for altering treatment approaches for improving mental health in non-adult populations.

AB  - Abstract As one of the most sustainable protein sources for humans, aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector in agriculture. According to the recent FAO estimate, there are 21 principal aquaculture fish species around the worldwide. Among these cultured species, almost half of them belong to Cypriniformes, the species from which all have a certain number of intermuscular bones (IBs). IBs are small spicule-like bones existing in the muscle fillet, which are existed only in lower teleost and of course have a negative effect on fish quality and aquatic product processing. Many studies have been focusing on IBs number, morphology, and more and more become focusing on its development molecular mechanism. In the review, we summarized the recent progress and discussed with following directions: (i) Controversial on the origin of IBs, ossified from tendons or ligaments? (ii) IBs counts and morphology revealed big variation among different species; (iii) Ossification patterns of IBs might be related with different swimming modes among the teleost fish, and its development belongs to intramembranous ossification without cartilaginous phase; (iv) Transcriptome/microRNA (miRNA)/proteomics and gene functional analysis had been used to investigate the molecular mechanism of IBs development and some genes showed certain regulatory roles during IBs? development; (v) The reports showed that some breeding technologies could make a certain effect on IBs counts in fish species, but there are rare reports with success on deleting or significantly reducing IBs counts. Meanwhile, we also discuss the challenges and future directions of reducing or even deleting IBs in aquaculture.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
