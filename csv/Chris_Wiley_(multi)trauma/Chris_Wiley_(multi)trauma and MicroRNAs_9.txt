AB  - We report the identification of sensitive and specific miRNA biomarkers for menstrual blood, a tissue that might provide probative information in certain specialized instances. We incorporated these biomarkers into qPCR assays and developed a quantitative statistical model using logistic regression that permits the prediction of menstrual blood in a forensic sample with a high, and measurable, degree of accuracy. Using the developed model, we achieved 100% accuracy in determining the body fluid of interest for a set of test samples (i.e. samples not used in model development). The development, and details, of the logistic regression model are described. Testing and evaluation of the finalized logistic regression modeled assay using a small number of samples was carried out to preliminarily estimate the limit of detection (LOD), specificity in admixed samples and expression of the menstrual blood miRNA biomarkers throughout the menstrual cycle (25?28 days). The LOD was <1 ng of total RNA, the assay performed as expected with admixed samples and menstrual blood was identified only during the menses phase of the female reproductive cycle in two donors.

AB  - Abstract Seven large European Union (EU)?funded epilepsy-related research projects joined forces in May 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, in a unique community building event?the epiXchange conference. During this conference, 170 investigators from the projects DESIRE, EpimiRNA, EPISTOP, EpiTarget, EpiXchange, and EpiPGX as well as the European Reference Network EpiCARE, met up with key stakeholders including representatives of the European Commission, patient organizations, commercial partners, and other European and International groups. The epiXchange conference focused on sharing and reviewing the advances made by each project in the previous 5 years; describing the infrastructures generated; and discussing the innovations and commercial applications across five thematic areas: biomarkers, genetics, therapeutics, comorbidities, and biobanks and resources. These projects have, in fact, generated major breakthroughs including the discovery of biofluid-based molecules for diagnosis, elucidating new genetic causes of epilepsy, creating advanced new models of epilepsy, and the pre-clinical development of novel compounds. Workshop-style discussions focused on how to overcome scientific and clinical challenges for accelerating translation of research outcomes and how to increase synergies between the projects and stakeholders at a European level. The resulting advances would lead toward a measurable impact of epilepsy research through better diagnostics, treatments, and quality-of-life for persons with epilepsy. In addition, epiXchange provided a unique forum for examining how the different projects could build momentum for future novel groundbreaking epilepsy research in Europe and beyond. This report includes the main recommendations that resulted from these discussions.

AB  - This report is the outcome of an EFSA procurement (NP/EFSA/GMO/2016/01) reviewing relevant scientific information on ncRNA and on RNA interference(RNAi) that could support the food and feed risk assessment of ncRNA-based genetically modified (GM) plants. Information was retrieved through key words and key questions covering the stability and degradation of ncRNAs after oral ingestion, the passage of ncRNAs from food and feed to human and animal organs and tissues via the gastrointestinal tract and other barriers, as well as the potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system or the entire organism.Full description of the strategy used for the literature search and for studies selectionis provided and the number of retrieved publications is reported. This report is divided into four partsdiscussing the kinetics of exogenous ncRNAs in humans and animals, with focus on ingested ncRNAs (Part 1); the possible effects of ncRNAs on the gastrointestinal tract (Part 2), systemically(Part 3)and on the immune system (Part 4). This report suggests that some plant ncRNAs (e.g miRNAs and siRNAs) show higher stability as compared to other ncRNAs due to peculiar chemical characteristics (2?-O-methylation at 3? end).However, ingested or administered ncRNA must overcome many extracellular and cellular barriers to reach the intended target tissue or functional location in sufficient amount to exert any biological effect. Literature data indicate that chemically unmodified and unformulated ncRNAs exhibit very low stability in the gastrointestinal tract and in biological fluids and, in general, do not elicit major biological effects.This report also provides an overview of the RNA content in plant-derived foods and diets and discusses the controversies on the presence of dietary exogenous RNAs in the biological fluids of humans and animals and their effects. Finally, gaps in the scientific literature are highlighted and recommendations provided

AB  - SUMMARY Animal reproductive biotechnology is continually evolving. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of early embryonic mortality and embryo development in domestic animals, which has improved the selection and success of in vitro technologies. Yet our knowledge is still relatively limited such that identifying a single embryo with the highest chance of survival and development for transfer remains challenging. While invasive methods such as embryo biopsy can provide useful information regarding the genetic status of the embryos, morphological assessment remains the most common evaluation. A recent shift, however, favors alternative, adjunct approaches for non-invasive assessment of an embryo's viability and developmental potential. Various analytical techniques have facilitated the evaluation of cellular health through the metabolome, the assessment of end products of cellular metabolism, or by analyzing spent media for small RNAs. This review discusses the application of noninvasive approaches for ascertaining the health and viability of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. A comparative analysis of noninvasive techniques for embryo assessment currently being investigated in cattle and humans is also discussed. Mol. Reprod.
