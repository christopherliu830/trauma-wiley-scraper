AB  - Abstract Background The percentage of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive blast cells is associated with prognosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but this association is unsubstantiated in pediatric AML. Procedure We retrospectively compared cytochemical MPO results with outcome in 154 patients younger than 21 years treated on three consecutive institutional protocols for newly diagnosed AML (1987?2001). Patients with FAB M0 and M7 AML (no MPO expression) or M3 AML (100% MPO expression) and Down's syndrome were excluded. Results Median MPO expression was higher in FAB M2 subtype than in other subtypes (P?<?0.0001) and differed significantly across cytogenetic risk groups (P?=?0.002) with highest MPO expression among those with favorable karyotypes. The percentage of MPO-positive blasts was not significantly associated with the probability of complete remission (P?=?0.97), event-free survival (P?=?0.72), or survival (P?=?0.76) in multivariate analyses that accounted for age, FAB subtype, presenting WBC count, cytogenetic and protocol treatment risk group. In analysis limited to patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, higher MPO expression appeared to be associated with improved EFS (P?=?0.06) but was not associated with remission induction rate (P?=?0.16) or overall survival (P?=?0.38). Conclusions The percentage of MPO-positive blast cells is related to FAB subtype in pediatric AML but has limited prognostic relevance. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2008;50:542?548. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Background: More than 100,000 people each year are admitted to U.S. hospitals for severe burn injury. Strikingly, ethanol use prior to injury is apparent in nearly 50% of burn patients, rendering them six times more likely to die from infection than patients not exposed to ethanol. We previously reported that the kinetics and magnitude of neutrophil chemokine production and subsequent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung was dramatically altered when ethanol exposure preceded injury. Here, we tested whether burn injury and ethanol exposure combined, altered susceptibility to infection, neutrophil chemoattractant production, and neutrophil accumulation at the site of the burn wound. Methods: Male B6D2F 1 mice were administered a dose of ethanol designed to achieve 90?100 mg/dl circulating levels and 30 min later subjected to a 15% total body surface area dorsal scald injury. Susceptibility to topically applied Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. At various times after injury, burn wound and normal tissues were collected for assessments of neutrophil counts, myeloperoxidase quantitation, and neutrophil chemoattractant (KC and MIP-2) production. Results: Ethanol exposure prior to burn injury enhanced susceptibility to infection after burn and was associated with significantly elevated production of KC, but not MIP-2, at the wound site. Despite the enhanced elevation of KC, neutrophil accumulation in the wounds of ethanol exposed, burn injured mice did not differ from those that received burn injury alone. TNFα (a potent activator of neutrophils), however, was found to be significantly elevated in the wounds of mice that received only burn injury, but not in those that received injury in combination with prior ethanol exposure. Conclusion: In the presence of ethanol, neutrophils are adequately recruited to the site of burn injury, but their host defense functions are impaired, perhaps due to the lack of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα.

AB  - Abstract We investigated mechanisms by which a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the CD11d subunit of the leukocyte integrin CD11d/CD18 improves neurological recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in the rat. The effects of an anti-CD11d mAb treatment were assessed on ED-1 expression (estimating macrophage infiltration), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO, approximating neutrophil infiltration), lipid peroxidation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine (indicating protein nitration) expression in the spinal cord lesion after severe clip-compression injury. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) production. After anti-CD11d mAb treatment, decreased ED-1 expression at 6?72?h after SCI indicated reduced macrophage infiltration. MPO activity (units/g tissue) was reduced significantly from 114?±?11 to 75?± 8 (??34%) at 6?h and from 38?± 2 to 22?± 4 (??42%) at 72?h. After SCI, anti-CD11d mAb treatment significantly reduced TBARS from 501?±?61 to 296?±?17?nm (??41%) at 6?h and to approximately uninjured values (87?nm) at 72?h. The mAb treatment also attenuated the expression of iNOS and formation of nitrotyrosine at 6?72?h after SCI. These data indicate that anti-CD11d mAb treatment blocks intraspinal neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, reducing the intraspinal concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These effects likely underlie improved tissue preservation and neurological function resulting from the mAb treatment.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - ABSTRACT Foot ulcers and poor wound healing are problematic for patients with diabetes. The beehive protectant Propolis can improve wound healing but whether it can improve healing in diabetic wounds has not been investigated. In this study, the effect of a single application of Propolis on epithelial closure, wound morphology, cellular infiltrate, and blood vessel density were investigated. Diabetes was induced in rats using streptozocin. After 6 weeks, diabetic and control animals were wounded and the wounds were treated with Propolis or saline as control. At days 6 and 12 animals were sacrificed and wounds were excised. Compared with controls, diabetes decreased epithelial closure and reepithelialization but had no effect on wound contraction. These delays were prevented by Propolis. At day 12, the impaired macrophage infiltration (C:1.49±0.09 vs. D:0.25±0.14), persistent neutrophil infiltration (C:0.22±0.19 vs. D:1.33±0.81), and increased myeloperoxidase activity (fourfold) in diabetic wounds were prevented by Propolis. Diabetes had no effect on wound volume, vessel number, or branch points. These novel data indicate that Propolis can accelerate wound healing in diabetes. As neutrophil infiltration is normalized, its mechanism of action may be through anti-inflammatory pathways. This result and the established safety profile of Propolis provide a rationale for studying topical application of this agent in a clinical setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic wounds often result from prolonged inflammation involving excessive polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity. Studies show that the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in fish oils generate bioactive lipid mediators that reduce inflammation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment in numerous inflammatory disease models. This study's purpose was to test the hypotheses that boosting plasma levels of EPA and DHA with oral supplementation would alter lipid mediator levels in acute wound microenvironments and reduce polymorphonuclear leukocyte levels. Eighteen individuals were randomized to 28 days of either EPA+DHA supplementation (Active Group) or placebo. After 28 days, the Active Group had significantly higher plasma levels of EPA (p<0.001) and DHA (p<0.001) than the Placebo Group and significantly lower wound fluid levels of two 15-lipoxygenase products of ?-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [p=0.033] and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid [p=0.006]), at 24 hours postwounding. The Active Group also had lower mean levels of myeloperoxidase, a leukocyte marker, at 12 hours and significantly more reepithelialization on Day 5 postwounding. We suggest that lipid mediator profiles can be manipulated by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid intake to create a wound microenvironment more conducive to healing.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cell disorders are uncommon but a subset of these disorders, especially mastocytoma, can histologically mimic leukemia cutis. Our objective was to employ a panel of cytochemical and immunohistolochemical markers to determine which markers would be most useful in distinguishing these entities. We studied 17 cases of cutaneous mast cell disorders (UP, TMEP, and mastocytoma) and 12 cases of leukemia cutis (myeloid, myelomonocytic and monocytic) with toluidine blue, Giemsa, pinacyanol erythrocyanate (PE), mast cell tryptase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), CD117, myeloperoxidase, CD43 and CD68. We found that PE stained the majority of cases of mast cell disorders (11/15) but did not stain leukemia cutis. Tryptase and MITF stained all cases of mast cell disorders but not leukemia cutis. Although CD117 showed strong staining in all cases of mast cell disorders, it also stained up to 25% of cases of leukemia cutis (2/8). Staining for myeloperoxidase was specific to leukemia cutis but detected only leukemias with myeloid differentiation (6/12). Our results show that mast cell tryptase and microphthalmia transcription factor are equally effective in distinguishing mast cell disorders from leukemia cutis. Interestingly, pinacyanol erythrocyanate appears to be specific for mast cell disease, as no staining was seen in leukemia cutis.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin reportedly exerts beneficial effects to attenuate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Heatstroke resembles septic shock in many aspects. Thus, this study was performed on the anesthetized rats by using heat exposure to induce heatstroke-associated MODS. We evaluated the effect of melatonin, a versatile molecule synthesized in the pineal gland and in many organs, in heatstroke rats and showed that melatonin (0.2?5.0?mg/kg of body weight, i.v., immediately after the start of heat stress) significantly (i) attenuated hyperthermia, hypotension and hypothalamic ischemia and hypoxia, (ii) reduced plasma index of the toxic oxidizing radicals like nitric oxide metabolites and hydroxyl radicals, (iii) diminished plasma index of hepatic and renal dysfunction like creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, (iv) attenuated plasma systemic inflammation response molecules like soluble intercellular and lesion molecule-1, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6, (v) promoted plasma levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (vi) reduced an index of infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lung like myeloperoxidase activity, and (vii) promoted the survival time to fourfold compared with the heatstroke alone group. Thus, melatonin could be a novel agent for the treatment of heatstroke animals or patients in the early stage.

AB  - Abstract We examined the effects of glutathione (GSH) preconditioning through the portal vein on rat warm liver ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R injury) and investigated the mechanisms involved. In rats with warm liver I/R injury, administration of GSH by means of the portal vein before ischemia increased the 7-day survival rates of rats after liver I/R from 38% to 75%. This effect was correlated with significantly improved liver function, depressed MDA content in the liver and fewer histologic features of hepatocyte injury. Intrahepatic expression of P-selectin and infiltration of neutrophils were increased significantly after liver I/R. GSH pretreatment decreased intrahepatic MPO content and the expression of P-selectin. However, it did not significantly affect the mRNA levels for P-selectin after liver I/R. Thus, preconditioning with GSH protects the liver against I/R injury by a mechanism dependent on free radical species scavenging, down-regulation of adhesion molecule expression and inhibition of neutrophil accumulation. These findings document the potential clinical utility of GSH to improve the overall success of diverse procedures, such as liver surgery and liver transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to investigate whether luminal perfusion with glutamine or with oxygenated glutamine solutions prevents endotoxin-induced changes in mucosal permeability. Methods: Three 15-cm segments of distal ileum were isolated in anesthetized 21-day-old piglets (n = 4) and perfused (50 mL/h) with Ringer's lactate solution, Ringer's lactate solution with 2% glutamine (wt/vol), glutamine, or glutamine purged with oxygen at 37°C for 280 minutes. Plasma-to-lumen clearances of 51Cr-EDTA and urea were measured to assess mucosal permeability. At time 0 minutes, loading and maintenance IV infusions of markers were begun. Baseline permeabilities were obtained from time 60 to 80 minutes, and IV endotoxin (50 ?g/kg) was introduced from time 80 to 140 minutes. Results: Results are expressed as the ratio of the clearances of the two probes (CEDTA/CUREA). Permeability increased from baseline in loops perfused with Ringer's lactate solution vs loops perfused with glutamine purged with oxygen and with glutamine alone (p <.01). Saturation with oxygen was without effect inasmuch as glutamine alone negated permeability increases. Intestinal myeloperoxidase activity did not differ with perfusate (p >.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that endotoxin-induced permeability changes can be prevented or delayed by the supply of luminal glutamine at the time of insult.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Summary The present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) in mice. Antinociceptive activity was assessed by employing different pain models, such as formalin test, acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, in mice. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was evaluated in CGP-treated mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using paw oedema induced by carrageenan, compound 48/80, serotonin, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and analyzed by plethysmometry. Quantitation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the paw was carried out to analyze the presence of neutrophils in the tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of CGP produced a significant inhibition in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of formalin-induced pain. The antinociceptive effect of CGP, evaluated in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, was detected for up to 6 h after treatment. Further, in the hot plate test, antinociceptive behaviour was evoked by CGP, and this response was inhibited by naloxone. Animals treated with CGP did not present changes in motor performance. In CGP-treated mice there was an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the periaqueductal gray. In another set of experiments, CGP attenuated the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan. Furthermore, CGP also reduced the carrageenan-increased MPO activity in paws. In addition, CGP also reduced the paw oedema evoked by compound 48/80, serotonin, and PGE2. Taken together, these results may support a possible therapeutic application of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro toward alleviating nociception and damage caused by inflammation conditions.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.
