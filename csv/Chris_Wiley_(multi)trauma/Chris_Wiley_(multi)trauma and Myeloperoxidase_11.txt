AB  - Abstract The small intestine plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure following circulatory shock. Current results show that reduced perfusion of the small intestine compromises the mucosal epithelial barrier, and the intestinal contents (including pancreatic digestive enzymes and partially digested food) can enter the intestinal wall and transport through the circulation or mesenteric lymph to other organs such as the lung. The extent to which the luminal contents of the small intestine mediate tissue damage in the intestine and lung is poorly understood in shock. Therefore, rats were assigned to three groups: No-hemorrhagic shock (HS) control and HS with or without a flushed intestine. HS was induced by reducing the mean arterial pressure (30 mmHg; 90 min) followed by return of shed blood and observation (3 h). The small intestine and lung were analyzed for hemorrhage, neutrophil accumulation, and cellular membrane protein degradation. After HS, animals with luminal contents had increased neutrophil accumulation, bleeding, and destruction of E-cadherin in the intestine. Serine protease activity was elevated in mesenteric lymph fluid collected from a separate group of animals subjected to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. Serine protease activity was elevated in the plasma after HS but was detected in lungs only in animals with nonflushed lumens. Despite removal of the luminal contents, lung injury occurred in both groups as determined by elevated neutrophil accumulation, permeability, and lung protein destruction. In conclusion, luminal contents significantly increase intestinal damage during experimental HS, suggesting transport of luminal contents across the intestinal wall should be minimized.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim: We hypothesize that selectins, which are adhesion molecules, are involved in the pathogenesis of stress-induced gastropathy. We therefore investigated whether the novel Sialyl Lewis X (SLex) analog, which is a clinically available antagonist of selectins, attenuate gastric mucosal lesions induced by thermal injury. Methods: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized and a 30% full-skin thickness dorsal burn was inflicted on each rat. The SLex analog was administrated into the jugular vein 30?min before and 2.5?h after the thermal injury. Saline was administered to the vehicle group. The distribution of E-selectin immunoreactivity on the luminal side of the gastric mucosal microvascular network was observed by immunohistochemical methods. Active oxygen species were measured by the chemiluminescence method. Rolling leukocytes and endothelial damage, investigated by using Monastral Blue B (MBB), of the gastric mucosal microvascular network were observed through an intravital microscope. Results: A high intensity of E-selectin fluorescence was observed on the luminal surface of the venular endothelial cells 5?h after thermal injury in the vehicle group. However, E-selectin-associated fluorescence was almost negligible in the non-injury group and in the SLex analog group. The SLex analog also attenuated the rolling of leukocytes in the venules, venular deposits of MBB, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence activities, and gastric mucosal lesion formation. Conclusion: It is suggested that the selectin family is involved in gastric microcirculatory disturbance and the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal lesions after thermal injury. A novel preventive therapy using the SLex analog is considered to effectively protect both gastric microcirculation and the gastric mucosa in rats with thermal injury. ? 2003 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd

AB  - Fibrous papule (FP), synonymous with angiofibroma, is a common lesion that is often biopsied to exclude carcinoma. Clinically, FPs are small, dome-shaped, solitary, flesh colored papules arising on the nose and face of adults. Histologically, FPs are characterized by a dome-shape, fibrotic collagenized stroma, sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and variably increased and dilated vascular spaces. The vast majority of FPs are readily diagnosable based on these clinical and histologic criteria. Rare histopathologic variants have been reported. Recognition of these variants may avoid misdiagnosis of this common benign lesion. We illustrate four rare variants of FP that can cause diagnostic uncertainty including: hypercellular, clear cell, pigmented, and pleomorphic variants. Cellular FP has a dense infiltrate of round fibroblasts that have a nevoid appearance. Clear cell FP has a proliferation of round clear cells, some with slightly foamy cytoplasm, resembling histiocytes or clear epithelial cells. Pleomorphic FP demonstrates bizarre, stellate fibroblasts like those seen in pleomorphic fibroma. Pigmented FP has prominent melanocytic hyperplasia and dermal melanophages that can be confused with a melanocytic lesion. It is important to recognize these unusual variants of FP in order to accurately diagnose this common benign lesion and avoid over treatment or rebiopsy.

AB  - Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis is characterized by recurrent crops of tender edematous nodules on the lower legs. lobular panniculitis with granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, focal necrosis and septal fibrosis is present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been detected in some lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cases of erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis were found. H & E stained slides were reviewed. PCR assays for M tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was carried out. PCR did not reveal mycobacterial DNA, with positive controls indicating the reliability of the assays. Among the MOTT, cutaneous infections are most commonly caused by M. marinum. Subcutaneous tuberculoid granulomas may be seen with M. kansaii, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. avium complex. M. gordonae and M. malmoense rarely cause cutaneous infections. M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gastri and M. asiaticum are probably not cutaneous pathogens. MOTT DNA was not found? in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis. Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis has diverse etiologies with varying pathogeneses leading to similar histologic changes. The cases analyzed may have not have had an infectious etiology. However, in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis, performance of? PCR for MOTT as well as Mycobacteria tuberculosis complex may still be beneficial, particularly in cases from immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder characterised by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. Skin lesions show distinctive thickened, fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. PXE-like fibers have not been described in patients without PXE. We describe 12 patients without known PXE who demonstrated the incidental finding of small numbers of PXE-like fibers in association with the following conditions: lipodermatosclerosis, granulomatous dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, morphea profunda, erythema nodosum, septal panniculitis, basal cell carcinoma and fibrosing dermatitis NOS. The biopsies were almost exclusively from the lower extremities of elderly women (mean age 73.8). The affected gene in PXE has been recently described as ABCC6 which codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. The c.3421C>T mutation has been associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease. We describe a novel assay for this genotype employing real-time PCR of paraffin embedded skin biopsies. Four patients with PXE-like fibers were tested in this fashion and did not carry this mutation. Our series demonstrates that light microscopic findings associated with PXE are not specific, as PXE-like fibers can be observed in patients without clinical or genetic evidence of the disease.

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.
