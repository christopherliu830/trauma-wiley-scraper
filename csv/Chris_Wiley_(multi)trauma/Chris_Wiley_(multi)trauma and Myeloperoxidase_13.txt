AB  - Title:?Will skin pathologists ever be replaced by noninvasive diagnostic tools (computers)? Intro: There are now many new non-invasive tools being developed to diagnose skin cancer, specifically melanocytic neoplasms. Whether these tools will ever be able to diagnose as well as a pathologist remains to be seen. In this paper, we will review most of the newly developed tools and discuss their specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Method: We reviewed the literature on currently available noninvasive diagnostic tools to find the published sensitivity and specificity rates of these tools. Tools without published information on their diagnostic accuracy were not included. We tabulated the accuracy data on the remaining tools and evaluated their relative diagnostic accuracy. Results: Melafind was found to have a specificity of 68?85% and a sensitivity of 95%?100%. Siascope was found to have a specificity of 82.7% and a sensitivity of 80.1%. Solarscan was found to have a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 100%. Comments: Non-invasive tools may be helpful in managing melanocytic neoplasms in patients with numerous lesions or with lesions in a cosmetically important site i.e. face. At present these tools cannot replace the value of a biopsy, microscopically reviewed by a pathologist.

AB  - Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis with cutaneous, skeletal, ocular, neurological, and dental abnormalities. It has been mapped to chromosome Xq28 encoding the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). NEMO regulates many genes, such as those that prevent apoptosis. IP is usually lethal in males. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are able to survive due to one normal X chromosome. We report a case of a male who presented after birth with multiple vesicles in a linear distribution on the calf progressing to persistent hyperpigmentation. At one month of age a punch biopsy showed verrucous hyperplasia with mild hypergranulosis, necrotic dyskeratinocytes and a lichenoid infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils and melanophages. A diagnosis of IP was rendered. No additional physical findings were noted. The patient was evaluated for Klinefelter syndrome. While his karyotype was 46, XY by conventional cytogenetics, a dual color interphase FISH detected 92.5% 46, XY and 6.5% 47, XXY. Our patient?s unique genetic array allowed a mechanism to escape and otherwise fatal disorder. This case illustrates the potential utility of using FISH analysis to detect Klinefelter syndrome in a male patient with IP and normal conventional chromosomal analysis.

AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma of the vulva (MMV) accounts for 2% of all melanomas in women with 5-year survival rate of 47%. Lymph node involvement predicts survival in these patients. Ki-67 expression has been correlated with lymph node status in cutaneous melanomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Ki-67 correlates with lymph node metastasis in MMV. Methods: Histomorphology and clinical information of 25?MMV were reviewed. The database was divided in MMV with metastasis (M+) and without lymph node metastasis (M-). A MMV subset was stained for Ki-67 and scored as a percentage (7 patients M+ and 9 patients M-). Results: The age range was 36?88 years-old (mean 63 years-old). The tumor thickness mean was 3.14?mm. The mean Ki-67 expression was 23% for M- and 42.5% for M+(p?=?0.07). Correlation of tumor thickness and Ki-67 expression also has a p value of 0.07. Logistic regression analysis was obtained.Conclusions: This study shows that Ki-67 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in MMV. However, when Ki-67 expression is compared to a classic prognostic indicator such as tumor thickness, it appears to have little or no additional predictive value. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

AB  - It is a little known fact that the organisms causing Zygomycosis are often better visualized with routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining than Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Experienced dermatopathologists, when evaluating histologic samples suspected of harboring deep fungal infection often rely more heavily on PAS staining to detect fungi. The diagnosis of Zygomycosis may be delayed or missed entirely if sufficient attention is not devoted to the H and E stained specimen. A review of multiple dermatopathology textbooks shows there is no universal agreement on the usefulness of routine H and E staining versus use of special stains for the detection of Zygomycosis. Grocott?s Methanamine Silver (GMS) staining can give false negative results if background staining of reticulum fibers is enhanced. This can occur because of overexposure in silver solution, excessive heat during processing, or use of incorrectly titrated solutions. Three consecutive culture proven cases of cutaneous Zygomycosis infection were evaluated. In each case, organisms were clearly visualized on routine H and E sections while PAS staining was variable. Examples of false negative GMS staining are also shown. Recognition of these staining properties can help dermatopathologists better detect the agents of Zygomycosis.

AB  - 76-year-old man presented with a hen?s egg-sized elevated nodule in his left sole in 4/04. He had been hospitalized because of icterus since 3/04. Although cancer of the pancreatic head had been strongly suspected on the imaging, he had refused surgical operation. No metastasis of the cancer had been found on the imaging. A dermatologist who biopsied the nodule in his left plantar recognized the swelling of inguinal lymph nodes on the same side. Histologically medium sized oval cells formed solid nests in the dermis, rendering them lobulated appearance. Some of the nests showed myxoid change in the stroma where tumor cells often showed cord-like arrangement. The border with surrounding tissue was relatively clear. The cells had round, and often eccentrically located nuclei with one or two small nucleoli and moderate to scarce amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was readily identifiable; >50/10HPF. Necrosis was not found. Immunohistochemically tumor cells were reactive for AE1/AE3, vimentin and S-100 protein and negative for ??SMA, CK14, EMA, HMB 45 and Melan A. MIB-1 labeling index was over 50%. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. The positivity for S-100 protein seen in this case necessitated us to differentiate it from melanoma.

AB  - We report unique histologic findings in scalp biopsies from two family members with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. Rapp-Hodgkin and the related AEC syndrome show a primary scarring alopecia and pili torti. The syndromes, which are related to ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome, have been credited to mutations in the TP63 gene. Most notable on biopsy is a primary scarring alopecia and abnormal hair shaft shape. Calcification in the outer root sheath epithelium, the basement membrane of the lower segment and within naked hair shafts is present. Neutrophils and bacterial rods and cocci are adjacent to the hair shaft in the superior segment, associated with dilated follicular ostia. Perifollicular fibrosis is associated with a variety of inflammatory cell types, mostly lymphocytic. One sample shows interfollicular irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, compact orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intraepidermal neutrophils. Follicular architecture is abnormal with abrupt and linear loss of nucleated matrical cells (B fringe of Adamson). The line of Ayber measures 0.30?mm on average. Hair shafts measure up to 0.16?mm, with variable abnormal cross sectional shape, usually square. Outer root sheath epithelium is disorganized with slight cellular pleomorphism, and the cuticle of the inner and outer root sheath is irregular in thickness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - Telomerase plays a role in the immortalization of cells and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on whether human telomerase RNA (hTER) expression differs in nevi, atypical nevi and melanomas using PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) or in situ hybridization assays. The aim of this study was to evaluate human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) staining in melanocytic lesions on paraffin-embedded tissues. Paraffin-embedded sections from 6 acquired nevi, 4 dysplastic nevi, 5 Spitz nevi, 6 primary invasive melanomas, and 3 metastatic melanomas, were studied for staining intensity (0?3+) and % of labeled cells with anti-hTERT. HTERT staining was observed in most cells (>75%) in all lesions, and was of greater intensity in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus, compared to the cytoplasm. Spitz nevi tended to have weaker hTERT staining (mean?=?1.2) compared to acquired nevi (mean?=?2.0), dysplastic nevi (mean?=?2.5), primary melanoma (mean?=?2.17), or metastatic melanoma (mean?=?3). Although telomerase activity was weaker in Spitz nevi, there was overlap with other nevi and primary invasive melanomas in our small series. Thus, hTERT expression does not appear to be a reliable adjunct to the histological diagnosis of primary melanocytic lesions.

AB  - Fibrous papule (FP), synonymous with angiofibroma, is a common lesion that is often biopsied to exclude carcinoma. Clinically, FPs are small, dome-shaped, solitary, flesh colored papules arising on the nose and face of adults. Histologically, FPs are characterized by a dome-shape, fibrotic collagenized stroma, sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and variably increased and dilated vascular spaces. The vast majority of FPs are readily diagnosable based on these clinical and histologic criteria. Rare histopathologic variants have been reported. Recognition of these variants may avoid misdiagnosis of this common benign lesion. We illustrate four rare variants of FP that can cause diagnostic uncertainty including: hypercellular, clear cell, pigmented, and pleomorphic variants. Cellular FP has a dense infiltrate of round fibroblasts that have a nevoid appearance. Clear cell FP has a proliferation of round clear cells, some with slightly foamy cytoplasm, resembling histiocytes or clear epithelial cells. Pleomorphic FP demonstrates bizarre, stellate fibroblasts like those seen in pleomorphic fibroma. Pigmented FP has prominent melanocytic hyperplasia and dermal melanophages that can be confused with a melanocytic lesion. It is important to recognize these unusual variants of FP in order to accurately diagnose this common benign lesion and avoid over treatment or rebiopsy.

AB  - Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis is characterized by recurrent crops of tender edematous nodules on the lower legs. lobular panniculitis with granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, focal necrosis and septal fibrosis is present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been detected in some lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cases of erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis were found. H & E stained slides were reviewed. PCR assays for M tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was carried out. PCR did not reveal mycobacterial DNA, with positive controls indicating the reliability of the assays. Among the MOTT, cutaneous infections are most commonly caused by M. marinum. Subcutaneous tuberculoid granulomas may be seen with M. kansaii, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. avium complex. M. gordonae and M. malmoense rarely cause cutaneous infections. M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gastri and M. asiaticum are probably not cutaneous pathogens. MOTT DNA was not found? in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis. Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis has diverse etiologies with varying pathogeneses leading to similar histologic changes. The cases analyzed may have not have had an infectious etiology. However, in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis, performance of? PCR for MOTT as well as Mycobacteria tuberculosis complex may still be beneficial, particularly in cases from immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder characterised by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. Skin lesions show distinctive thickened, fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. PXE-like fibers have not been described in patients without PXE. We describe 12 patients without known PXE who demonstrated the incidental finding of small numbers of PXE-like fibers in association with the following conditions: lipodermatosclerosis, granulomatous dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, morphea profunda, erythema nodosum, septal panniculitis, basal cell carcinoma and fibrosing dermatitis NOS. The biopsies were almost exclusively from the lower extremities of elderly women (mean age 73.8). The affected gene in PXE has been recently described as ABCC6 which codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. The c.3421C>T mutation has been associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease. We describe a novel assay for this genotype employing real-time PCR of paraffin embedded skin biopsies. Four patients with PXE-like fibers were tested in this fashion and did not carry this mutation. Our series demonstrates that light microscopic findings associated with PXE are not specific, as PXE-like fibers can be observed in patients without clinical or genetic evidence of the disease.

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Diagnostic concordance of intraepithelial malignancy is generally only fair. Because the diagnosis of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma is not uniform and because such terms are not consonant with the nomenclature of other human epithelial malignancies, nomenclature revisions have been attempted. One hundred dermatopathologists were solicited to review 15 tissue sections representing a spectrum of varying thickness epidermal malignancy and to choose either actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma as the diagnosis. Among the 77 participating dermatopathologists intraclass correlation was high for what was perceived as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and their differentiation. Development of a two-tiered diagnostic system that retains our present diagnostic capabilities, but better fits the pathobiology of superficial epidermal malignancy is suggested.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are proteins that may play importants roles in survival, proliferation and progression to metastasis in several tumors, including melanoma. There is little information on the expression pattern of the phosphorylated (i.e. activated) forms of such kinases in melanoma and their impact on overall survival (OS). We sought to determine the expression, by immunohistochemistry, of phosphorylated MAP kinase (pMAPK), Akt (pAkt) and C-kit (pCkit) in primary and metastatic melanoma, and their correlation with OS. Fifteen patients with Stage III and Stage IV (metastatic melanoma) disease were randomly selected from the UT MD Anderson database. Expression was rated by two investigators on intensity (negative, weak, moderate, and strong) and proportion of reactive tumor cells (0?=?<5%, 1?=?5?25%, 2?=?>25?75%, 3?=?>75%). Eleven of the 15 tumors (primary and/or metatasis) exhibited pMAPK expression (73%). Corresponding percentages were 100% for pAKT and <50%(7/15) for pCkit. OS ranged from less than one year to 9 years. However, there was no correlation between OS and expression of any of these markers.

AB  - A 57-year-old Hispanic man with a personal and family history of bullae and photosensitivity, presented with a fungating, ulcerated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) on his left hand. Physical exam showed conjunctival injection, urethral stricture, symblepharon, loss of teeth, short stature, nail dystrophy and extensive poikiloderma. Excision and lymph node dissection showed moderate to poorly differentiated deeply invasive SCC, necessitating an amputation. Two of three axillary lymph nodes were positive. A random biopsy of the trunk showed epidermal atrophy, telangiectasia and pigment laden macrophages consistent with poikiloderma. Electron microscopy (EM) illustrated extensive reduplication of the basement membrane with loops, curls and free extensions of the basal lamina in the superficial dermis, reduced numbers of hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils, and a basement membrane focally devoid of basal cells. On the basis of the clinical features and the characteristic basement zone changes, a diagnosis of Kindler Syndrome (KS) was rendered. KS is a rare autosomal recessive photosensitivity disorder which contains features of both congenital poikiloderma and dystrophic epidermolytic bullosa, and has unique EM features. Despite the photosensitivity, few cases of malignancy in KS have been reported.

AB  - A 32-year-old African American male presented with a five year history of multiple verrucous plaques in a Blaschkoid arrangement on the left leg. Biopsies demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. The patient?s medical history did not reveal any heritable or exposure related risk factors. The patient was treated with radiotherapy. Four years later, he presented with a subcutaneous nodule within a prior site of radiation. MRI showed a 2.0???1.2?cm enhancing nodule in the subcutis. On biopsy, an ill-defined spindle cell proliferation was present in the dermis and subcutis. Marked nuclear pleomorphism and numerous multinucleated cells embedded in a myxoid stroma were noted. Spindle cells stained for CD68. Cytokeratin and S-100 were negative. A diagnosis of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma was rendered. Surgical excision was undertaken. A dominant lesion of MFH was identified, as well as multiple, clinically undetectable foci of early sarcoma. This is an unusual case of multifocal post-radiation sarcoma in an African American patient with squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. While sarcoma is a known risk factor following radiotherapy, the course of this patient would suggest caution in applying radiation in similar clinical settings, as well as long-term clinical follow-up for early detection and treatment of post-radiation sarcoma.

AB  - A 65 year-old, well-appearing and asymptomatic man presented with a small non-healing ulcer on the right palm present for 6 weeks. He reported a 15 year history of hand and foot ?eczema? treated with topical steroids. Six months earlier his right 4th toe had been amputated for ?infection?, but additional information was not immediately forthcoming. Punch biopsy from the palm demonstrated superficial ulceration, dermal eosinophils and possible cytoplasmic inclusions within keratinocytes, leading to suspicion of parapox infection. Over the ensuing two months his condition deteriorated markedly, and he developed multiple fungated and ulcerated cutaneous nodules. Incisional biopsy of the nodule on the right palm revealed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, and a perivascular infiltrate of medium to large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei and mitoses. These atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, but were negative for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, TIA-1 and EBER in-situ hybridization. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement revealed a clonal population. Retrospective analysis of the amputated toe demonstrated similar features. He declined conventional treatment, and has been reluctant to pursue follow-up. Our case highlights the fulminant course and dense mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with eosinophils often present in peripheral T-cell lymphoma that may complicate diagnosis.

AB  - Partial regression of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma is not uncommon, and may predict a higher likelihood of metastasis and decreased survival. Complete histologic regression of a primary cutaneous melanoma is a rarer occurrence of uncertain significance, with only 30 cases reported in the literature. Herein, we detail five additional cases of complete histologic regression of a primary cutaneous melanoma, which were discovered upon presentation with metastatic disease. A pigmented lesion, or its remnant, coupled with historical information was strongly suggestive of cutaneous malignant melanoma. However, histologic examination of the lesions in toto using multiple levels, and in some cases immunohistochemical stains, failed to reveal residual melanoma. Our cases are typified by the presence of metastasis of malignant melanoma to regional lymph nodes, with the absence other suspicious lesions or other malignancies. Through these instructive cases, the concept of completely regressed primary cutaneous melanoma is reviewed and the literature critically appraised. When considering a diagnosis of completely regressed primary cutaneous melanoma, it is important that the cases be well-documented and biopsy-proven. All patients with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with an occult primary lesion require a thorough and complete skin examination and consideration of completely regressed cutaneous melanoma within the differential.
