AB  - A 61-year-old female presented with blurry vision. Questioning revealed ?Flu-like? symptoms preceding the blurry vision by two weeks. An ophthalmologist diagnosed anterior granulomatous dermatitis, which improved with prednisolone drops. One month later, an ?itchy rash? and constitutional symptoms including fever, night sweats, and weight loss were reported. Physical examination revealed a viral-type maculopapular eruption over the trunk and proximal extremities. A few weeks later, repeat examination showed progression to a diffuse, reddish-brown, slightly edematous, papular eruption. Lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia, a polyclonal gammopathy, and an elevated ESR. Punch biopsies on two occasions showed a proliferation of mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytic cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. Emperipolesis was easily demonstrated. A background of plasma cells and small lymphocytes were noted. Stains for organisms were negative, and polarizable material was not present. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes marked with S-100 but were negative for CD1a. A diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai Dorfman was made. The cutaneous symptoms improved over six months without medical therapy. Cutaneous Rosai Dorfman disease with constitutional symptoms and laboratory evidence of systemic involvement but without lymphadenopathy has not been previously described. This unusual case suggests that a wider spectrum of disease presentation may exist.

AB  - An 11-year-old adopted male presented with deforming scalp and bilateral posterior auricular nodules, joint contractures, and gingival hypertrophy. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodules revealed a normal epidermis with areas of extracellular eosinophilic ground substance surrounding benign spindle-shaped (myo)fibroblasts in the dermis and subcutis, alternating with hyalinized, acellular zones. The spindle cells did not show cytologic atypia. A diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) was given. The patient had been seen multiple times in the past for similar recurring, disfiguring dermal and subcutaneous nodules. The patient had a history of osteolytic lesions of the distal radius and ulna and hyaline deposition involving the sigmoid colon and rectum. JHF is a rare autosomal recessive hyalinosis with mutations of the Capillary Morphogenesis Gene-2 (CMG-2) at chromosome 4q21, a region that encodes a binding protein that concatenates capillary collagen IV to laminin. Other genetic abnormalities include mutations in dermal collagen (types I and III). Disease onset occurs early in life. Organ involvement is an ominous sign usually resulting in death during infancy or early childhood. Surgery is the only presently available treatment.

AB  - Cellular blue nevus is composed of dendritic melanocytes, together with islands of epithelioid and plump spindle cells. We examined 58 cases of blue nevi. Fourteen cases were common blue nevi. The remaining 44 blue nevi were divided into three types according to its silhouettes. These were nodular (type 1, 18 cases), nodular with notch (type 2, 16 cases), and rounded pushing patterns (type 3, 10 cases). Well circumscribed top heavy nodule was observed in type 1, and it was limited to the dermis. Type 2 showed budding appearance into the subcutaneous tissue. Type 3 revealed bottom heavy with downward pushing margin. Both type 2 and type 3 were demonstrated biphasic patterns of epithelioid and spindle cells. Perineural distribution of melanocytes was also observed in type 2 and 3. The size of these types was 3.3?mm in type 1, 4.7?mm in type 2, and 7.4?mm in type 3. The thickness of these types was 1.6?mm in type 1, 2.5?mm in type 2, and 5.2?mm in type 3. Our results suggest that cellular blue nevi may be divided into three stages. Type 1 is its early stage, and may be misinterpreted as common blue nevi.

AB  - A 34-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-c) and idarubicin. Seven days later, while on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, she simultaneously developed fever coupled with painful, pruritic, and erythematous plaques on the face, neck, and chest along with marked edema and erythema of both palms and one sole. With negative blood cultures and a skin biopsy showing epithelial cell vacuolar degeneration and neutrophilic infiltrates surrounding eccrine gland coils, a diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) was rendered. Treatment with oral dapsone rapidly cleared the eruption. During her first consolidation with Ara-C and idarubicin four weeks later, a similar febrile cutaneous eruption occurred and again dapsone therapy led to resolution. For subsequent consolidation courses, pre-medication with dapsone was instituted and the patient remained eruption-free. NEH is a rare and often misdiagnosed disorder. Multiple chemotherapy medications have been implicated as etiologic agents including Ara-c, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, bleomycin, and mitoxantrone. Current oncologic induction-consolidation protocols carry the potential for recurrent NEH in predisposed patients. As this is only the second report of prophylactic dapsone therapy for NEH, further investigation into this topic is warranted.

AB  - Background: Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD), can be strikingly similar, if not indistinguishable, histologically from scleromyxedema. Both disorders consist of a dermal and subcutaneous proliferation of fibroblast-like cells with mucin production. NFD has been shown to contain an increased number of dual positive CD34 and procollagen cells, as well as an increased number of factor XIIIa positive cells. To our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison between the histologic and immunophenotypic properties of scleromyxedema and NFD. Design: Nine biopsies from eight cases of NFD and eight biopsies from eight cases of scleromyxedema were identified. Standard immunohistochemical techniques for antibodies toward CD34, procollagen I, CD31, SMA, and factor XIIIa were applied. A colloidal iron stain was used to evaluate for dermal mucin. Amount of antibody expression and mucin production were then evaluated using a grading scale of 0?3. Results: Both NFD and scleromyxedema were found to have similar immunophenotypic expression. Both demonstrated increased numbers of CD34 and procollagen-positive fibroblast-like cells, as well as increased numbers of factor XIIIa positive cells. Increased vessels and stromal mucin were identified in both diseases without significant differences. Conclusions: Although scleromyxedema and NFD are clinically distinct diseases, their? morphologic and immunophenotypic appearances are likely to be similar.

AB  - Although subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive form of lymphoma, some patients manifest a long waxing and waning phase unaccompanied by constitutional symptoms. Magro et?al (2004) applied the term ?atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis (ALLP)? to this distinctive form of lymphocytic panniculitis. Eight ALLP patients (five females and three males, mean age: 34.0?±?12.5) were encountered from Jun 1999 to Nov 2003 at GyeongSang National University Hospital in Korea. Five patients (62.5%) had skin lesions only and oral prednisone therapies were done. Two of five had no relapse but three showed a waxing and waning course till now. In three patients (37.5%) presenting cytopenias and fevers, chemotherapies were done with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicine, bleomycin and/or adriamycin. Two of three led to complete resolution till now and included only one patient with clonal T-cell receptor-gamma rearrangements. In seven patients, serum EBV antibody studies were performed. Six of them suggested EBV reactivation state and one was asymptomatic EBV carrier. In three patients, tissues EBV ISH were done and all were positive to EBER and lytic probe.

AB  - Cutaneous small blue cell tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms whose differential includes primary adnexal, neuroendocrine and lymphoproliferative tumors, as well as metastatic lesions. Another entity to be considered in the differential is Ewing?s sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). We present a 19-year-old female who developed a solitary, subcutaneous mass on her back. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated, cellular, nodular neoplasm of small, blue cells containing round to ovoid, vesicular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cam 5.2 and CD99. Overall, the lesion resembled an malignant spiradenoma (spiradenocarcinoma). CD99 reactivity prompted analysis with dual-color interphase FISH for translocations involving (22q12), which was positive, a sensitive marker for ES/PNET. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of ES/PNET should be considered in the differential of primary cutaneous blue cell tumors. These lesions are difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous small blue cell tumors due to their rarity and because the diagnosis is often not considered at this site.

AB  - We present the case of a 27 year-old female with a linear array of brown keratotic papules with a raised nodule within, located in the right mid upper inner thigh. A biopsy of the nodule showed a superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision of the entire lesion showed an epidermal nevus without residual carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas developing within an epidermal nevus constitute an unusual association, mostly occurring in long standing lesions of elderly patients. Other epithelial neoplasms described arising within epidermal nevi include basal cell carcinomas, malignant eccrine tumors and keratoacanthomas. Although our patient did not have an identifiable epidermal nevus syndrome, the presence of a squamous cell carcinoma within an epidermal nevus in a young person suggests increased susceptibility to tumor development. Moreover, chromosomal aberrations have been described in epidermal nevi, including chromosomal breakage and variegated translocation mosaicism. We suggest that the presence of an epidermal nevus should alert the clinician for the potential development of a malignant neoplasm within it, including squamous cell carcinoma, even in the absence of an identifiable hamartoma-neoplasm syndrome.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital for change in mental status. She had a splenectomy five years prior to admission. The white blood cell count was 154,000 cells/microliter with 95% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis and Candida krusei. She developed a wrist lesion at the site of a previous arterial line. The lesion had a striking resemblance to a bulls-eye, with three distinct concentric zones. A bedside touch preparation rapidly processed with Periodic Acid Schiff staining demonstrated a single intact aseptate broad hypha. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae throughout the dermis and subcutis invading both blood vessels and interstitum. A skin biopsy specimen sent for fungal culture grew Rhizopus arrhizus. Cutaneous zygomycosis is a rare, devastating disease that can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. This case illustrates a distinct morphology, which we have coined the ?bulls-eye infarct of cutaneous zygomycosis?. Recognition of this unique appearance allows a rapid bedside diagnosis of this life threatening infection. To our knowledge, this morphology has been reported only twice in the medical literature.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) may be idiopathic, drug-induced, related to infection, or may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. Our objective was to determine whether tissue eosinophilia is a reliable indicator of a drug-induced etiology in the setting of LCV. Thorough chart investigation of 63 patients with LCV was performed with division of patients into drug-induced and non-drug-induced groups. Corresponding histopathologic material was reviewed by a dermatopathologist blinded to the etiologic associations.? An eosinophil score was tabulated by averaging the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (400x) and dividing by the density of inflammation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin rank sums test. Mean eosinophil scores in the drug-induced (n?=?16) and non-drug-induced (n?=?47) groups were 5.20 and 1.05 respectively (p?=?0.0126). Vascular fibrin deposition and epidermal changes were present in both groups. Clinical evidence of systemic vasculitis was present in 6%(1/16) of the drug-induced group vs. 38%(18/47) of the non-drug-induced cases. This study establishes tissue eosinophilia as a reliable indicator of drug induction in the setting of LCV. Furthermore, this information may be useful for guiding management decisions, especially in settings of unclear etiology.

AB  - BRAF encodes a serine-threonine kinase, which acts in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway transducing regulatory signals from RAS to MEK1/2. Somatic mutations in BRAF have been identified in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi. More than 90% of these mutations consist of a valine to glutamate substitution at codon 599 (V599E) of exon 15. While a high prevalence of BRAF mutations in common melanocytic nevi has been reported in adults, nevi in children have not been studied. Of interest, we have previously shown that Spitz nevi in children do not harbor mutations in BRAF. To investigate the association of BRAF mutations with patient age, we studied common melanocytic nevi in children for the V599E activating mutation. Tumor cells were microdissected from 6 common melanocytic nevi in children 10 years of age or younger, and analyzed for the V599E mutation in BRAF by allele-specific PCR and gel electrophoresis. In 6 of 6 (100%) nevi, the V599E mutant allele was observed. Our data suggest that similar genetic pathways are involved in the development of common melanocytic nevi in children and adults. The absence of BRAF mutations in Spitz nevi in children is therefore associated with tumor type, not patient age.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common primary cutaneous carcinomas, but on rare occasion, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a distant site or solid organ can present as a cutaneous lesion. Most metastases to the skin present as dermal nodules or involve the dermal lymphatics, but when they are intimately associated with the epidermis, distinguishing the lesion as primary or metastatic may be extremely difficult and usually requires a clinical history or high index of suspicion. A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of breast carcinoma, status post radiation therapy and subsequent mastectomy. She developed multiple eruptive nodules over her mastectomy site, flank and back two years later. Histologically the lesions appeared to be arising from the surface epidermis and consisted of atypical, predominantly spindle cells, some of which streamed off of the basal layer of the epidermis. Following review of the mastectomy specimen material and performing additional immunohistochemical studies, it became clear that the origin of the carcinomas was metastatic from an underlying metaplastic breast carcinoma.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - p63, a recently identified homologue of p53 gene, has been reported to be essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms versus adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis using p63 monoclonal antibody (clone 4A4) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 10 malignant adnexal tumors, and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) benign adnexal tumors showed strong p63 expression; the remaining 7(35%) cases had over 50% p63-positive nuclei. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive for p63 (p?<?0.0001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN) is a rare hamartomatous malformation of the eccrine duct which typically presents at birth or early in life. Multiple punctate pits and verrucous papules and plaques with nonfollicular hyperkeratotic spines are seen over the palms and soles and may extend to the distal extremities. A linear distribution may be present. A wide range of involvement has been reported in the literature, including bilateral systematized involvement. No systemic involvement has been linked to PEODDN to date. Histologic findings are characteristic and include a dilated eccrine acrosyringium with an overlying parakeratotic column or cornoid lamella. There is slight dyskeratosis and loss of the granular layer under the cornoid lamella. Here, we present a case of bilateral systematized PEODDN in an otherwise healthy, 18 year-old Hispanic female. Physical examination is notable for marked hypoplasia of the left breast with overlying verrucous papules and plaques. Multiple punch biopsies were performed and showed findings diagnostic of PEODDN. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive involvement of PEODDN reported in the literature to date and the only case with associated hypoplasia of the breast.

AB  - Clear cell hidradenoma is a benign eccrine tumor with nodular-cystic architecture, ductal differentiation and poroid cytology. Squamous islands occurring in eccrine neoplasms are classified into three types, according to their location, histologic characteristics and degrees of cellular atypia. Type I squamous islands resemble normal epidermis and are present in the superficial to middle portion of eccrine poromas. Type II squamous islands are localised in the deeper portion of eccrine poromas and show lumen formation suggestive of acrosyringeal differentiation. Type III squamous islands show atypical features and are limited to malignant eccrine tumors. A 55-year-old man was biopsied for a dermal nodule on his left arm. The initial shave biopsy revealed the surface of an intradermal cystic nodule with numerous whorls and horn pearls of squamatization, reminiscent?of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; however, no cytologic atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity were identified; focal clear cell and ductal differentiation were also present. Complete excision revealed clear cell hidradenoma with extensive mixed type I and type II squamous islands. The presence of whorls and pearls of squamoid cells is a rare finding in clear cell hidradenoma that, moreover, in the setting of a superficial biopsy, may be a diagnostic pitfall.
