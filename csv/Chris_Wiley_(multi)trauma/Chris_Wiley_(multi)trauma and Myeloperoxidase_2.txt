AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the effect of acepromazine (ACP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by stimulated equine neutrophils. Study design? Ex vivo biochemical experiments. Animals? Isolated neutrophils from healthy untreated horses. Methods? Neutrophils were incubated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m and then stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) before measurement of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). In a second experiment neutrophils were incubated in the presence of α-keto-? methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and treated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m. Subsequent PMA stimulation lead to neutrophilic ROS production and decomposition of KMB to ethylene, which is measured by gas chromatography. Electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping (EPR) analysis was performed with PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of ACP (10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m) directly added to the cell suspension. In the second experiment, the same concentrations of ACP were pre-incubated with neutrophils, then centrifuged to eliminate the excess of ACP and re-suspended in phosphate buffer before stimulation with PMA. In all experiments, the results of ACP-treated and ACP-untreated stimulated neutrophils were compared. Results? Overall, results obtained with lucigenin-enhanced CL and KMB oxidation were in agreement with those seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acepromazine induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on neutrophilic ROS production. Electron paramagnetic resonance also showed, at high ACP concentration, the appearance of a cation radical derived from ACP. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance study performed with pre-incubated neutrophils showed an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of ACP. Conclusion? The results indicate that ACP can neutralize O??2 or its by-products during the stimulation of neutrophils. Clinical relevance? These findings may have a therapeutic relevance when phenothiazines are used in horses suffering from inflammatory diseases in which neutrophil activation and ROS production are implicated.

AB  - It has been speculated that a prolonged and elevated neutrophilic response has an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds. This has raised the possibility that one or more of these proteases might be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for chronic wounds. The purpose of this study was to examine several primarily neutrophil-derived proteases present in pressure ulcer tissues and to determine whether protease activity could be correlated with neutrophil levels. Biopsies of pressure ulcers were taken from consented subjects (n?=?13) and again after 3 months standard care. Mean wound volume decreased 2.4?cm3 per month; however, volumes of six wounds were increased at the end of the study. Levels of extractable myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and gelatinase (MMP-9) activities were determined. Mean levels of MPO (n?=?11) at study initiation and after 3 months were nearly identical (2945 and 2845 milliunits per mg extract, respectively). Interestingly, these levels were similar to that previously found in healing open dermal wounds at 4 days postwounding. MPO levels increased in the extracts obtained from three subjects and declined in five subjects. Elastase (corr. 0.265 p?=?0.233) and MMP-8 (corr. ?0.05 p?=?0.835) activities correlated poorly with MPO. This is likely a reflection of differences in the access of protease inhibitors (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin, TIMP, and alpha2?macroglobulin) to these wounds. As expected, a greater correlation level was observed between the proteases (MMP-8 vs. elastase corr. 0.362 p?=?0.097; MMP-8 vs. MMP-9 corr. 0.55 p?=?0.009). The results from this study highlight the high degree of variability that can be observed in the pressure ulcer environment. This further suggests that a combination of biomarkers will be required for making accurate diagnostic assessments of chronic wounds. This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.
