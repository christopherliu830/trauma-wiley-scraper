AB  - The histologic diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma is challenging, particularly when the overlying junctional component is absent and when the spindle cells lack melanin pigment. In these instances, the importance of immunohistochemistry cannot be overemphasized. S-100 protein, with a sensitivity approaching 90%, is the primary immunohistochemical stain used for this purpose. HMB-45, although a more specific marker for melanocytes, is often negative in these cases. A marker of schwannian differentiation, p-75 NGF-R has been shown to be a useful confirmatory marker for desmoplastic and neurotropic melanoma, with staining intensity comparable to or better than S-100 protein. We report two cases of desmoplastic melanoma which stained focally and weakly with S-100 protein in comparison with the stronger staining of p-75 NGF-R. In both cases, S-100 staining could have been missed or interpreted as non-confirmatory, thus misguiding the diagnosis. We therefore suggest that p-75 NGF-R be a complementary marker to S-100 protein in differentiating desmoplastic melanoma from other non-neural crest-derived spindle cell tumors.

AB  - The spectrum of melanocytic proliferations ranges from banal to overtly malignant. Borderline melanocytic lesions which bridge these two extremes pose a challenge, as their biological nature remains undefined. We set out to evaluate the utility of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in such lesions. Our compendium was defined by 11 cases of borderline melanocytic proliferations whereby sentinel node sampling was conducted. There were three severely atypical dermal-epidermal melanocytic proliferations manifesting borderline features with nevoid melanoma (calf, shoulder, knee), three arising in association with a deep penetrating nevus (chest, shoulder, and arm), three atypical Spitz?s tumors (helix, calf, arm, back), and two atypical pigment-synthesizing melanocytic tumors, resembling equine melanotic disease in one and cellular blue nevus in another (buttock, calf, arm). The patient population comprised seven males and five females ranging in age from age 9?36 (mean: 25 years). At least one positive sentinel lymph node was uncovered in seven of the cases with a positive sentinel lymph observed in all but one case of deep penetrating nevus and atypical Spitz?s tumor. The identification of sentinel lymph node positivity in seven of the twelve cases (58%) validates the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the setting of borderline melanocytic proliferations.

AB  - The histological findings in tinea corporis are variable, but include parakeratosis, often with neutrophils, spongiosis, and dermal inflammation. A recent study found some degree of papillary dermal edema in 17 to 23% of tinea cases. We report five cases of tinea corporis in which prominent papillary dermal edema (PDE) was the salient histological finding. Prominent PDE is often associated with diagnoses such as Sweet syndrome, polymorphous light eruption, allergic contact dermatitis and arthropod bite reactions. Interestingly, the submitted clinical diagnoses for our cases included Sweet syndrome (2), arthropod bite reaction (2), immunobullous disease (2), fixed drug eruption (1), eczema (1) and tinea (2). Our first case was a 25-year-old female with recurrent edematous plaques in fixed sites. Her lesions completely cleared with repeated courses of systemic steroids, but recurred after steroid taper. One fungal hypha was overlooked on her first biopsy and she was erroneously diagnosed with fixed drug eruption or a blistering disease (immunofluorescence negative). Six months later, repeat biopsy showed PDE, and numerous hyphae were seen on PAS stain. This prompted us to carefully examine PAS-stained sections on subsequent cases with prominent PDE. Prominent papillary dermal edema may be a clue to dermatophyte infection.

AB  - Epithelioid cell histiocytoma (ECH) is regarded as a variant of fibrous histiocytoma. It is not readily recognized as fibrous histiocytoma because of its unconventional histologic features and its resemblance to Spitz nevus. The ECH reported herein was from a 50-year-old man who presented with an asymptomatic, 1.5?cm, polypoid mass of unknown duration on his posterior shoulder. Histologic examination revealed epidermal collarette and dermal sheets of epithelioid cells with granular cytoplasm. Both fine and coarse granules were noted in the cytoplasm. They were PAS positive and diastase resistant. Many dilated vessels were also noted in the lesion. A panel of immunostains including S100, vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A was done. The lesional cells were reactive with vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A, and non-reactive with S100. These results favored exclusion of Spitz nevus and granular cell tumor, and supported the histologic impression of ECH. Both fine and coarse cytoplasmic granules were reactive with CD68. The latter finding supports that the cytoplasmic granules in this ECH represent lysosomes as in granular cell tumors.

AB  - A 27-year-old male soldier who was stationed in Iraq from 3/03 to 9/03 presented to a local dermatologist in 4/04 with several red slightly raised non-ulcerated nodules over the right wrist and ventral arm developed 2?3 months prior to the visit. The clinical impression was sporotrichosis. A punch biopsy was performed on a subcutaneous nodule and showed a granulomatous inflammatory process with scattered loosely organized clusters of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around dermal mucin, mainly involving the papillary and mid dermis. A diagnosis of granuloma annulare was suggested. Intralesional triamcinolone was used and the lesions initially improved but later recurred. However on deeper sections, there were scattered granulomas with a dominant necrotizing granuloma consisting of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around a central area of necrosis surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. In 5/04, he presented to the Birmingham VA Medical Center with similar lesions. A repeat biopsy again showed a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, numerous intracytoplasmic organisms with kinetoplasts were present within histiocytes. The findings were consistent with leishmaniasis due to L. major as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at Walter Reed Hospital. As more US soldiers return from the Middle East, previously rare cutaneous leishmaniasis will be seen more commonly.

AB  - Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic, various associated skin lesions have been recognized. One interesting phenomenon is chronic photosensitivity dermatitis. We report the case of a 44-year old homeless male with a 14-year history of HIV and a CD4 count of 350. He presented to us with a 5-month history of a pruritic photodistributed eruption. Physical examination revealed that he had erythematous, scaly, lichenified, and crusted plaques involving the face, neck, upper chest, and extensor extremities. Sparing of the areas under his watch and bracelet was found. A skin biopsy specimen showed psoriasiform dermatitis with an overlying thick, impetiginized, and hemorrhagic crust. There was prominent single cell necrosis throughout all epidermal layers. A lichenoid dermal infiltrate consisted mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. The patient?s presentation was consistent with a photosensitive psoriasiform interface dermatitis. The pathogenesis of this photodermatitis is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include the formation of a neoantigen due to UV exposure, depressed levels of endogenous scavengers leading to increased oxidative stress, and the onset of a pellagra-like dermatosis due to niacin-tryptophan deficiency. It is likely that several of these processes are acting in concert to cause this photoeruption.

AB  - A 40 year-old female with sero-negative arthritis presented with annular and cord-like configurations (rope sign) of asymptomatic papules and plaques along her flanks, suspected to be granuloma annulare. Medications at the time of presentation included methotrexate, prednisone, Vioxx (rofecoxib), Arava (leflunomide) and Remicade (infliximab). High-potency topical corticosteroids did not alleviate the eruption. Biopsy was performed demonstrating a deep dermal, interstitial and focally palisading granulomatous infiltrate with eosinophils. Dermal lymphangiectases were present, and the epidermis was unaffected. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination showed deep dermal, interstitial IgG, C3, and IgM deposits coating collagen bundles centered in the granulomatous infliltrate and IgG antinuclear keratinocyte reactivity. Serologic tested also revealed anti-nuclear antibodies. No other auto-antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with ?interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with cords and arthritis?. Thirteen cases of IGD with cords were identified in a literature review of which 7/12 (58%) were sero-(rheumatoid factor)-negative, 3/5 (60%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 12/13 (92%) had arthritis. One theory of pathogenesis is that immune-complex deposition in the dermis initiates a granulomatous reaction; DIF findings in this case support this proposed mechanism. IGD with cords is a singular clinicopathologic entity associated with sero-negative, non-erosive arthritis and antinuclear antibodies.

AB  - An 85-year-old woman developed a tumor on her left thigh, thought to be a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Microscopy revealed irregularly shaped, bulbous and deep aggregates of pale/clear cells emanating from the surface and reaching the lowermost dermis. This asymmetric mass of keratinocytes showed focal necrosis and dyskeratosis but no frank anaplasia, mitoses or infiltrative pattern. The interface with the dermis was blunt but irregularly undersurfaced. A more characteristic pale cell acanthoma (PCA) was colliding with it and consisted of a superficial, more regularly psoriasiform proliferation with thin suprapapillary plates and erosion but no necrosis. While it has been known that PCA can be unusual polypoid, large or atypical no author has proposed that some of the latter variants could represent a malignancy, more akin to verrucous carcinoma than to conventional SCC, due to the paucity of overt anaplastic features and the underestimation of pushing invasion and low cytologic atypia as defining traits of malignancy. One case of SCC in situ with PCA has been recently acknowledged but this is not what we are reporting: We propose that voluminous, misshapen, asymmetric or deep ?PCAs? may be low-grade carcinomas with pale cell differentiation and likely origin in a pre-existing PCA.

AB  - We describe a case of PCCS in a 73 year-old male who presented with a rapidly growing tumor of 6 months duration on the right ear. Clinical examination revealed a 5???4???4-cm ulcerated, crusted, exophytic tumor on the superior aspect of the helix. Histologically, the mass revealed a biphasic tumor with malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The epithelial component consisted of a few foci of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The majority of the tumor was composed of osteogenic sarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). An intricate transition of BCC into sarcoma was noted in a few foci. Atypical mitosis and necrosis were common. The BCC and tumor giant cells in the MFH area showed positive immunoreaction for cytokeratin and CD68 respectively. The tumor was negative for S-100 protein, HMB-45, muscle actins, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. In conclusion, a PCCS growing predominantly as osteosarcoma and MFH is reported. Although the exact histogenesis of PCCS is unknown, primitive mesenchymal cells of the dermis, surrounding the follicular units, are capable of pluripotent differentiation and are likely the source of origin of the sarcoma. The known aggressive biological behavior warrants wide excision and given the rare reports of metastasis and death, regular follow-up is required

AB  - Background: Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins. The role of cyclin D1 in the development, progression and prognosis of melanomas is controversial. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin. Methods: A total of 101 melanocytic lesions of the skin including compound nevi (21), intradermal nevi (18), melanoma in situ (3), primary invasive melanoma (30), and metastatic melanoma (29) were evaluated for cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The following tiered system was used for scoring: 0% of cells with nuclear staining (score 0), 1?19% nuclear staining (score 1), 20?49% nuclear staining (score 2), and 50% or greater nuclear staining (score 3). Results: The average score for primary melanomas was significantly higher compared to nevi (p?=?0.0046), and for in situ melanomas compared to primary invasive melanomas (p?=?0.011). There was slightly higher level of expression in compound nevi versus intradermal nevi. Conclusion: Our study indicates that cyclin D1 expression is increased in malignant compared to benign melanocytic lesions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the biological role of cyclin D1 in melanocytic lesions of the skin.

Case presentation: A 62-year-old Black female presented to our clinic with a wide spread of hyper-pigmented erythematous grayish plaques on trunk, extremities and face. There were no associated systemic illnesses and laboratory work was otherwise within normal range. Two skin biopsies were taken from the trunk and extremity. Both of the biopsies reveal similar features of coexisting like lichen planus and mycosis fungoides. There was interface dermatitis, vacuolar degeneration, prominent colloid body formation and lichenoid lymphonocytic inflammation through out the dermis. Epidermis was atrophic with overlying hyper and parakeratosis. There were many areas of epidermotrophism with collections of atypical lymphocytes. There was also marked pigmentory incontinence in the dermis. Comment: We present an uncommon case of mycosis fungoides with changes of lichen planus. It is important familiarise oneself with uncommon presentations of mycosis fungoides. It may be worthwhile to look for mycosis fungoides, while reviewing a classical case of lichen planus with clinical presentation of lichen planus.

AB  - Forty-four cases of biopsy-proven cutaneous metastases from internal organ or soft tissue malignancies were retrieved at a single institution from 1990 to 2004. All cases had detailed clinical and follow-up data. There were 19 males and 25 females, with a wide age range (37?86 years). Most (75%) had advanced (stage IV) disease at the time of metastasis. In four patients skin metastasis was the presenting lesion. The most common primary site for men is lung and for women, breast and lung. In nearly half of patients cutaneous metastasis was not the clinical diagnosis. The prognosis was grave (67% died of disease within a median of 7 months). Independent, blinded review by four dermatopathologists showed that without a detailed clinical history, most metastases from carcinomas were correctly suspected based on histologic patterns. However, metastases from small cell carcinomas and sarcomas were difficult to distinguish from primary skin tumors. Histologic recognition of a primary site was often difficult without pertinent clinical history. None of the metastasis had a combined immunohistochemical profile of B72.3 (?), CA125 (?), calretinin (+), p63 (+) and CK5/6 (+), which was commonly seen in skin adnexal tumors. This immunohistochemical panel appears to best differentiate the two entities.

AB  - Malignant mesothelioma presenting as a primary umbilical tumor is not reported in the English literature, to our knowledge. We present a 63-year-old woman with a painless and initially skin colored nodule in the umbilical area, which within one month became erythematous. The performed biopsy revealed an infiltrating glandular and ductal proliferation involving the dermis, subcutaneous fat and underlying skeletal muscle embedded in a loose and mucinous stroma. The tumor cells were of medium size with round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were conspicuous. The tumor cells showed a positive reaction for kermix, EMA, CK5/6, calretinin and CK7 and a negative reaction for CK20, CEA, Ber-Ep4, S100 protein, TTF-1, PRP, ERP, and Leu-7. Since calretinin is both a sensitive and specific marker of reactive and neoplastic mesothelial cells, a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid variant, was made. The performed exploratory laparotomy showed no evidence of malignancy and wide excision of the umbilical area showed no evidence of residual tumor. Follow-up examinations of the patient with repeated CT scans for the past two years were negative for recurrent or metastatic disease. We conclude that this malignancy likely developed in a setting of umbilical abnormalities associated with mesothelial remnants.

AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple cafÃ© au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis limited to the skin. A total of ten cases, all women, in four families, and one sporadic case have been described in the English literature. The disorder usually begins in childhood and progresses slowly. We report two sporadic cases of adult-onset progressive mucinous histiocytosis in unrelated African American women, age 48 and 55?years old respectively, who developed red-brown and flesh-colored, asymptomatic papules on the face, arms and legs without truncal, mucosal or visceral involvement. The lesions show no spontaneous regression. Both patients lack associated systemic symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia or seizures. There is no underlying hyperlipidemia, paraproteinemia or lymphoproliferative disease. No family history of similar lesions can be identified. Light microscopy reveals dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes with abundant mucin deposition. Electron microscopy demonstrates a high number of myelin-figures or zebra bodies in the cytoplasm of histiocytes. On immunohistochemistry, positive staining with macrophage markers CD68, HAM56 and lysozyme, and Factor XIIIa, a transglutaminase present in dermal dendrocytes, and negative staining with Langerhans cell markers CD1a and S100, and CD34, a marker present in dermal dendritic cells derived from uncommitted mesenchymal cells, are observed.

AB  - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) may be idiopathic, drug-induced, related to infection, or may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. Our objective was to determine whether tissue eosinophilia is a reliable indicator of a drug-induced etiology in the setting of LCV. Thorough chart investigation of 63 patients with LCV was performed with division of patients into drug-induced and non-drug-induced groups. Corresponding histopathologic material was reviewed by a dermatopathologist blinded to the etiologic associations.? An eosinophil score was tabulated by averaging the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (400x) and dividing by the density of inflammation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin rank sums test. Mean eosinophil scores in the drug-induced (n?=?16) and non-drug-induced (n?=?47) groups were 5.20 and 1.05 respectively (p?=?0.0126). Vascular fibrin deposition and epidermal changes were present in both groups. Clinical evidence of systemic vasculitis was present in 6%(1/16) of the drug-induced group vs. 38%(18/47) of the non-drug-induced cases. This study establishes tissue eosinophilia as a reliable indicator of drug induction in the setting of LCV. Furthermore, this information may be useful for guiding management decisions, especially in settings of unclear etiology.

AB  - BRAF encodes a serine-threonine kinase, which acts in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway transducing regulatory signals from RAS to MEK1/2. Somatic mutations in BRAF have been identified in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi. More than 90% of these mutations consist of a valine to glutamate substitution at codon 599 (V599E) of exon 15. While a high prevalence of BRAF mutations in common melanocytic nevi has been reported in adults, nevi in children have not been studied. Of interest, we have previously shown that Spitz nevi in children do not harbor mutations in BRAF. To investigate the association of BRAF mutations with patient age, we studied common melanocytic nevi in children for the V599E activating mutation. Tumor cells were microdissected from 6 common melanocytic nevi in children 10 years of age or younger, and analyzed for the V599E mutation in BRAF by allele-specific PCR and gel electrophoresis. In 6 of 6 (100%) nevi, the V599E mutant allele was observed. Our data suggest that similar genetic pathways are involved in the development of common melanocytic nevi in children and adults. The absence of BRAF mutations in Spitz nevi in children is therefore associated with tumor type, not patient age.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common primary cutaneous carcinomas, but on rare occasion, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a distant site or solid organ can present as a cutaneous lesion. Most metastases to the skin present as dermal nodules or involve the dermal lymphatics, but when they are intimately associated with the epidermis, distinguishing the lesion as primary or metastatic may be extremely difficult and usually requires a clinical history or high index of suspicion. A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of breast carcinoma, status post radiation therapy and subsequent mastectomy. She developed multiple eruptive nodules over her mastectomy site, flank and back two years later. Histologically the lesions appeared to be arising from the surface epidermis and consisted of atypical, predominantly spindle cells, some of which streamed off of the basal layer of the epidermis. Following review of the mastectomy specimen material and performing additional immunohistochemical studies, it became clear that the origin of the carcinomas was metastatic from an underlying metaplastic breast carcinoma.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.
