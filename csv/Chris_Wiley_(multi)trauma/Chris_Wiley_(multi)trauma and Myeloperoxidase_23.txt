AB  - The glomus coccygeum is a vestigial structure related to the canals of Sucquet-Hoyer, an arteriovenous anastomosis surrounded by glomus cells derived from modified smooth muscle and involved in thermoregulation. It is an incidental finding in specimens from the sacral area and may represent a diagnostic challenge to the unaware observer. We present a case of a glomus coccygeum, presenting as a 1.5?mm structure adjacent to a typical pilonidal cyst excised from a 7-month-old boy, that was the subject of a second opinion consultation. The lesion showed small to medium sized clusters of predominantly epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, intercellular borders and plump, round nuclei with fine chromatin. These cells were closely associated with small vascular channels and nerves. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the epithelioid cells expressed vimentin, muscle-specific actin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein, were weakly positive for smooth muscle actin, and negative for desmin, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The endothelial cells of the vascular channels were antibody CD31 positive. Recognition of the histological features of glomus coccygeum is important to avoid confusion with glomus tumor and neural or smooth muscle neoplasms in the sacral area.

AB  - Background: Laminin-5 is a basement membrane constituent that functions as an anchoring filament to integrin-derived hemidesmosomes, and has been detected at the invasive front (tumor-stromal interface) in many types of carcinomas. Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - The patient is an eight-year-old white male with a prior history of a small bowel transplant secondary to gastroschisis and a history of chronic rejection. He was admitted to the hospital to rule out rejection of his second small bowel transplant. During the admission he developed painful erythematous plaques with necrosis and hemorrhagic bullae on his left knee and left neck. Dermatology was consulted and biopsies and tissue cultures were obtained. On H&E there were multiple thick walled non-septate hyphae and the GMS stain showed right angle irregular branching hyphae with an affinity for blood vessels. A further work-up for disseminated disease was negative. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous mucormycosis. The patient underwent extensive surgical debridement and was started on Ambisone and treated for six months with resolution. Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic deep fungal infection. It is the most acute and fatal of all fungal infections. There are multiple associated conditions including immunosuppression. This disease can be controlled with early diagnosis and a combination treatment plan. There are only a few reported cases in the pediatric population.

AB  - Distinguishing among the various melanocytic proliferations remains one of the biggest challenges in dermatopathology. New insights into tumor proliferation may lead to the discovery of helpful immunohistochemical markers. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase which is a core component of the PI3K signalling pathway. Activation of Akt is seen in many human cancers. This study evaluated Akt activation (phospho-Akt) by immunohistochemistry on 18 intradermal nevi, 8 dysplastic nevi, 9 Spitz nevi, and 27 melanomas. Immunostaining was graded 0 (no staining), 1 (slightly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (highly positive). The mean immunostaining scores were as follows: intradermal nevi 1.16, dysplastic nevi 1.25, Spitz nevi 2.11, and melanomas 2.15. Spitz nevi exhibited significant pAkt immunoreactivity. Increased pAkt immunoreactivity is seen in melanomas and Spitz nevi as compared to benign intradermal nevi and dysplastic nevi.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - Paecilomyces, a hyalohyphomycosis, is an uncommon cause of cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Most cases reported have occurred in patients with impaired host defenses or following a surgical procedure, and have proven highly resistant to anti fungal therapies. A 60-year-old man presented with scattered non-healing verrucous lesions as well as ulcers and excoriations on the upper extremities and trunk. The lesion had begun shortly after the patient was scratched by prickly okra. The patient had no underlying health problems and he was on no medication. Histology revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, with papillomatosis with intraepidermal micro-abscess formation. Within the dermis there was a mixed acute and chronic granulomatous infiltrate. With GMS stain numerous pleomorphic yeast forms and pseudohyphael forms were seen. Cultures confirmed Paecilomyces species. The patient was treated with Voriconazole with complete resolution of his lesion. Paecilomyces is an emerging fungal pathogen, which in our immune competent patient manifest as widespread cutaneous disease.

AB  - Porokeratosis is an uncommon cause of clinical change in pigmented lesions. We report two cases of so-called ?collision? lesions, in which the cause of clinical change in melanocytic nevi was porokeratosis. One biopsy was submitted concurrently with a biopsy from another anatomic site, which was a superficial pattern basal cell carcinoma. Both the melanocytic nevus and the basal cell carcinoma contained coronoid lamellae, focal diminution of the granular layer and subjacent dyskeratotic keratinocytes, consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). The melanocytic nevus, from the lower back, was a broad compound melanocytic nevus, associated with elongated, pigmented rete (lentiginous) and small melanocytes in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis (superficial congenital pattern). There was no evidence of external irritation. The second case showed a similar coronoid lamella, focal diminution of the granular layer and dyskeratotic keratinocytes. There was additional parakeratosis away from the parakeratotic column and a lichenoid host response, suggesting external irritation.

AB  - The histopathological changes of herpes simplex, zoster and varicella are considered to be indistinguishable from one another. The clinical setting with adjunctive studies generally clarifies the diagnosis. Vesicular lesions in all 3 conditions can involve epidermal and adnexal epithelium with characteristic cytopathic features. We describe 3 patients with non-vesicular eruptions on the head and neck whose biopsies revealed exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes. All three patients developed typical herpes zoster within days of the biopsy. There is compelling scientific evidence in the literature indicating that, in herpes zoster, the virus is transported from dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia via myelinated nerves to the skin. These terminate at the isthmus of hair follicles and primary infection of follicular and sebaceous epithelium occurs. Secondary spread of infection to the epidermis follows. In contrast, data pertaining to recurrent herpes simplex indicates that axonal transport of the virus from sensory ganglia to the skin is directed primarily to the epidermis, via terminal non-myelinated nerve twigs. The clinical evolution of our 3 cases and scientific data in the literature indicate that exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes, in the setting of a non-vesicular eruption, represents early herpes zoster.

AB  - A 27-day-old female neonate presented with a bleeding growth on the abdomen. The clinical differential diagnosis included pyogenic granuloma and hemangioma. Histology shows an ulcerated, spindled and round cell tumor in the dermis with ill-defined margins that invade the subcutaneous fat. The tumor exhibits a biphasic growth pattern with plump spindled cells arranged in fascicles, as well as epithelioid cells arranged in sheets. Some cells show plasmacytoid features. The tumor cells have pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. Single cell necrosis and mitotic activity is prominent. Myxoid and chondroid stromal changes are focally seen. Immunohistochemical stains show strong positivity for S100 protein, calponin, and, focally, AE1/AE3. Portions of the both the spindled and epithelioid cell components show staining with EMA. Desmin and MSA stains were negative. The tumor does not stain for CD 31, CD 30, CD 45, CD 20, CD 34, CK 20, MART-1, or HMB45. These histologic features are consistent with a cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma. Cutaneous myoepitheliomas are rare tumors of myoepithelial cells which surround eccrine and apocrine glands. While most myoepitheliomas are benign, tumors with high mitotic activity may have a risk for recurrence or metastasis. This is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient described with myoepithelial carcinoma.

AB  - Summary This chapter summaries neurological manifestations of disorders of other body systems and outlines some basic elements of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ? the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.
