AB  - Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) is reported as a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. Recently, continuous blood purification (CBP) has been mostly applied for MODS treatment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CBP on plasma phospholipid level in patients with MODS. Methods A total of 126 patients with MODS and 120 healthy people were collected. The serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes were detected, and the correlation among phospholipid compounds with serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes was analyzed. Results Before CBP, levels of body temperature, RR, HR, CVP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 were obviously higher, and pH, HCO3-, PaO2, SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 were lower in the MODS group than those in the control group. During CBP, the MODS group had gradually declined RR, CVP, levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 and increased HCO3-, PaO2 and SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747. Besides, levels of PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 had an obvious negative correlation with levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, BUN, SCr, and PaCO2, and a significant positive correlation with levels of HCO3-, PaO2, and SaO2. Conclusion CBP could effectively ameliorate clinical signs of patients with MODS and correct the plasma phospholipid levels.

AB  - Background and Purpose Intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (II/R) injury is a serious clinical problem. Here we have investigated novel mechanisms and new drug targets in II/R injury by searching for microRNAs regulating such injury. Experimental Approach We used hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) of IEC-6 cell cultures and models of II/R models in rats and mice. Microarray assays were used to identify target miRNAs from rat intestinal. Real-time PCR, Western blot and dual luciferase reporter assays, and agomir and antagomir in vitro and in vivo were used to assess the effects of the target miRNA on II/R injury. Key Results The miR-351-5p was differentially expressed in our models and it targeted MAPK13 and sirtuin-6. This miRNA reduced levels of sirtuin-6 and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and activated forkhead box O3 (FoxO3α) phosphorylation to cause oxidative stress. Also, miR-351-5p markedly reduced MAPK13 level, activated polycystic kidney disease 1/NF-?B signal and increased NF-?B (p65). Moreover, miR-351-5p up-regulated levels of Bcl2-associated X, cytochrome c, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1, cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 by reducing sirtuin-6 levels to promote apoptosis. In addition, miR-351-5p mimic in IEC-6 cells and agomir in mice aggravated these effects, and miR-351-5p inhibitor and antagomir in mice alleviated these actions. Conclusions and Implications Our data showed that miR-351-5p aggravated II/R injury by promoting intestinal mucosal oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis by targeting MAPK13 and sirtuin-6.These data provide new insights into the mechanisms regulating II/R injury, and of miR-351-5p could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for such injury.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Abstract The discovery of nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide, NO) as the vasodilator molecule endothelium-derived relaxing factor revealed a major physiological role for this simple diatomic molecule. We now know that NO regulates cardiovascular function, is a neurotransmitter, and is a component of the innate immune response to infection and cancer. The physiological effects of NO are mediated by its varied chemistry which includes redox chemistry and interaction with transition metals. NO can interact with iron-heme-containing proteins including hemoglobin and cytochrome c oxidase, and nonheme iron proteins such as aconitase and bacterial transcription regulatory proteins. NO reacts with superoxide to form the highly reactive peroxynitrite which decomposes to give the hydroxyl radical. Nitrosothiols, thiol adducts of NO, act to control NO release, and to shuttle NO between proteins and transport NO across cell membranes. NO is produced by one of three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, endothelial NOS, neuronal NOS, and inducible NOS. Signaling functions are mediated via interaction with the heme-containing protein soluble guanylate cyclase (GC), which produces the cell signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This, in turn, is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which turns off NO signaling. Perturbation in NO function contributes to the pathophysiology of many disease states. Endothelial dysfunction and subsequent reduced NO production contribute to hypertension and atherosclerosis. Excess NO is a mediator of inflammatory disease, and neurodegenerative disease, due in part to the production of peroxynitrite. The cardiovascular collapse observed in septic shock is caused by the vasodilator action of NO. Targeting the NO pathway theoretically provides many opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The NO donor drugs glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, and amyl nitrate are used to treat acute angina; and inhaled NO is used to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension in new born infants. Conversely, NOS inhibitors and NO scavengers have been explored to counteract NO as a mediator of disease. Though promising results have been obtained in animal models of disease these latter approaches have had little clinical success. However, targeting downstream of NO has been more successful with new clinically approved classes of drugs such as the inhibitors of PDE5 sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil; and the stimulator of the NO receptor soluble GC, riociguat. It has become apparent that the biological actions, and biological chemistry, of NO are very complex. New opportunities for drug discovery could result from an improved understanding of the biology of NO.
