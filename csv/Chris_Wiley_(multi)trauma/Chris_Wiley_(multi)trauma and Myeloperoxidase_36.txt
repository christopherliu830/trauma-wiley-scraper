AB  - Summary: The complement system has once again come into prominence in the therapeutic development arena. The recent approval of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, eculizumab, which is directed against complement component C5 for the disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has provided the initial validation of this system as a therapeutic target. Preclinical studies using animal models and human-derived samples demonstrate that inhibition of complement ameliorates many inflammatory and autoimmune disease manifestations. Major efforts continue to define the most optimal means to block complement activation in a cost-effective manner. Because the system is initiated through three pathways and generates at least six immunoregulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators, there is substantial complexity to this problem. One pathway, designated the alternative pathway, has recently been shown to play a particularly important role in preclinical disease models. Further evidence of the importance of the alternative pathway has been provided by studies of human diseases, where mutations or dysfunctional polymorphisms that promote activation of this pathway are highly associated with the diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, dense deposit disease, and age-related macular degeneration. This article reviews evidence in support of the essential role of the alternative pathway in the generation of tissue injury and the rationale for development of therapies that modulate its activity.

AB  - Abstract Neurological disorders occur in the central and peripheral nervous system and include Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Activation of the innate immune system inevitably occurs in all forms of neurological disorders. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimolecular complex that can sense danger signals associated with neurological disorders. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 maturation in microglia, where neuroinflammation contributes to neurological disease development and progression. Thus, this review attempts to elucidate the current knowledge regarding NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Recent scientific findings with respect to neuroprotective effects of dietary phytochemicals against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neurological disorders summarized in this review suggest that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by plant-derived phytochemicals could be a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are the gold standard in cases of massive hemorrhage, but induce hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury, a serious complication associated with hemorrhage and RBC resuscitation. Thus, the development of a novel resuscitable fluid that is not associated with hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury would be desirable. It was reported that exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) treatment ameliorated hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury accompanying liver transplantation. This suggests that transfusions with CO-bound RBC (CO-RBC) might protect against hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury following massive hemorrhage and resuscitation compared with RBC resuscitation. To investigate this, we created a hemorrhagic shock model rat, followed by resuscitation with RBC and CO-RBC. Hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury and the destruction of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) were significantly ameliorated in the CO-RBC resuscitation group compared with the RBC resuscitation group. The free heme derived from the destruction of hepatic CYP was correlated with hepatic oxidation and injury, suggesting that CO-RBC was a major factor in the amelioration of hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury induced by hemorrhage and resuscitation via hepatic CYP protection. These results indicate that CO-RBC has potential for use as a resuscitative fluid in blood transfusion and does not suffer from the limitations associated with the RBC transfusions that are currently in use. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103:2199?2206, 2014

AB  - 1 Extravasation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and associated plasma leakage are key events in the inflammatory process. The kinetics of PMN-induced changes in endothelial barrier function were studied by means of confluent monolayers of bovine aorta or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC), cultured on permeable membranes and mounted in a two-compartment diffusion chamber. The model permitted continuous measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and analysis of protein efflux and PMN migration across the EC monolayer. 2 Transendothelial chemotactic stimulation (fMLP or LTB4) of PMN resting on EC in the upper compartment induced a prompt decline in TEER, followed by an increase in protein flux and transmigration of PMN. Adding the chemoattractant together with PMN in the upper compartment provoked adhesion of PMN, fall in TEER and increase in protein permeability, but no transmigration of PMN, whereas inhibition of PMN adhesion to EC by pretreatment with anti-CD18 mAb prevented all responses to chemotactic stimulation. 3 Chemoattractant-induced adhesion of PMN to the EC monolayer induced a rapid rise in EC cytosolic free Ca2+, similar to that obtained by direct stimulation of EC with histamine, indicating an active response of EC to PMN activation and adhesion. 4 In summary, continuous recording of transendothelial electrical resistance in the in vitro model described permits rapid and sensitive analysis of leukocyte activation-induced effects on EC barrier function. The kinetics and specificity of the EC and PMN responses to chemoattractant stimulation suggest that activated PMN, via adhesion-dependent events, have a direct effect on EC junctional integrity independent of whether transmigration occurs or not.
