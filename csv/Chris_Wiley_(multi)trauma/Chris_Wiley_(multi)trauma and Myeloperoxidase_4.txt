AB  - Abstract Male infertility is a multi-factorial disorder, and identification of its etiology in an individual is critical for treatment. Systematically elucidating the underlying genetic causes (chromosomal and Yq microdeletion) and factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), which contribute to sperm DNA damage, may help to reduce the number of men with idiopathic infertility and provide them with the most suitable therapeutics and counseling. This study was done to comprehensively investigate genetic and oxidative stress factors that might be the etiology of a large percentage of men with idiopathic infertility. One hundred twelve infertile men and 76 fertile controls were screened for chromosomal aberrations and Yq microdeletions. ROS, TAC, and sperm DNA damage were assessed in cytogenetically normal, non-azoospermic men with intact Y chromosome (n?=?93). ROS was assessed in neat and washed semen by chemiluminescence; seminal TAC with a commercially available kit; and sperm DNA damage by the comet assay. Two men had cytogenetic abnormalities and seven men harbored Yq microdeletions. ROS levels in neat and washed semen of infertile men were significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Infertile men had significantly lower (P?<?0.01) TAC levels (1.79?mM), whereas sperm DNA fragmentation in infertile men was significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Genetic factors and oxidative stress cumulatively account for large number of idiopathic infertile cases. Unlike, genetic causes, which cannot be cured, timely identification and management of oxidative stress may help to reverse/reduce the effects on induced DNA damage, and improve the outcomes for infertile males.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous disease with the hallmarks of alveolar capillary membrane injury, increased pulmonary oedema and pulmonary inflammation. The most common direct aetiological factor for ALI is usually parenchymal lung infection or haemorrhage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALI. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) plays an important role both in production of ROS as well as their removal through the supply of NADPH. However, how G6PD modulation affects NOX2-mediated ROS in the airway epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury has not been explored previously. Therefore, we investigated the effect of G6PD inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide on G6PD activity, NOX2 expression, ROS production and enzymatic anti-oxidants in AECs in a mouse model of ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ALI led to increased G6PD activity in the AECs with concomitant elevation of NOX2, ROS, SOD1 and nitrotyrosine. G6PD inhibitor led to reduction of LPS-induced airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration as well as NOX2-derived ROS and subsequent oxidative stress. Conversely, ALI led to decreased glutathione reductase activity in AECs, which was normalized by G6PD inhibitor. These data show that activation of G6PD is associated with enhancement of oxidative inflammation in during ALI. Therefore, inhibition of G6PD might be a beneficial strategy during ALI to limit oxidative damage and ameliorate airway inflammation.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - Summary Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a robust inflammatory response consisting of activated neutrophils, macrophages, astrocytes, T cells and B cells. The magnitude and timing of the immune response vary depending upon the spinal level of injury (thoracic vs. cervical), injury severity, species and strain, age at the time of injury, and mode of injury (i.e. contusion, compression or ischemic). Regardless of these factors, however, these immune responses persist after SCI and contribute to pathological and reparative processes. Throughout this chapter, we will discuss the role that individual aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses may be playing in repair or pathology after SCI. Where appropriate, current clinical therapies targeting these immune response will be highlighted.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.

AB  - Abstract The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS, e.g., liver, spleen) is often treated as a ?blackbox? by nanoresearchers in translating nanomedicines. Often, most of the injected nanomaterials are sequestered by the MPS, preventing their delivery to the desired disease areas. Here, this imperfection is exploited by applying nano-antioxidants with preferential liver uptake to directly prevent hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related disease. Ceria nanoparticles (NPs) are selected as a representative nano-antioxidant and the detailed mechanism of preventing IRI is investigated. It is found that ceria NPs effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of hepatic IRI by scavenging ROS, inhibiting activation of Kupffer cells and monocyte/macrophage cells. The released pro-inflammatory cytokines are then significantly reduced and the recruitment and infiltration of neutrophils are minimized, which suppress subsequent inflammatory reaction involved in the liver. The protective effect of nano-antioxidants against hepatic IRI in living animals and the revealed mechanism herein suggests their future use for the treatment of hepatic IRI in the clinic.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Inhibition of cAMP-dependent stimulation of vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium following haemorrhagic shock is mediated by reactive nitrogen species released within the airspaces of the lung. We tested here the hypothesis that the prior activation of the cellular heat shock or stress response, via exposure to either heat or geldanamycin, would attenuate the release of airspace nitric oxide (NO) responsible for the shock-mediated failure of the alveolar epithelium to respond to catecholamines in rats. Rats were haemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30?35 mmHg for 60 min, and then resuscitated with a 4 % albumin solution. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by change in concentration of a protein solution instilled into the airspaces 5 h after the onset of haemorrhage. Stress preconditioning restored the cAMP-mediated upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance after haemorrhage. The protective effect of stress preconditioning was mediated in part by a decrease in the expression of iNOS in the lung. Specifically, stress preconditioning decreased the production of nitrite by endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages removed from haemorrhaged rats or by A549 and rat alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers stimulated with cytomix (a mixture of TNF-Î±, IL-1? and IFN-?) for 24 h. In summary, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that stress preconditioning restores a normal fluid transport capacity of the alveolar epithelium in the early phase following haemorrhagic shock by attenuating NO-mediated oxidative stress to the lung epithelium.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Abstract The activation status of neutrophils can cycle from basal through primed to fully activated (?green-amber-red?), and at least in vitro, primed cells can spontaneously revert to a near basal phenotype. This broad range of neutrophil responsiveness confers extensive functional flexibility, allowing neutrophils to respond rapidly and appropriately to varied and evolving threats throughout the body. Primed and activated cells display dramatically enhanced bactericidal capacity (including augmented respiratory burst activity, degranulation and longevity), but this enhancement also confers the capacity for significant unintended tissue injury. Neutrophil priming and its consequences have been associated with adverse outcomes in a range of disease states, hence understanding the signalling processes that regulate the transition between basal and primed states (and back again) may offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in pathological settings. A wide array of host- and pathogen-derived molecules is able to modulate the functional status of these versatile cells. Reflecting this extensive repertoire of potential mediators, priming can be established by a range of signalling pathways (including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, phospholipase D and calcium transients) and intracellular processes (including endocytosis, vesicle trafficking and the engagement of adhesion molecules). The signalling pathways engaged, and the exact cellular phenotype that results, vary according to the priming agent(s) to which the neutrophil is exposed and the precise environmental context. Herein we describe the signals that establish priming (in particular for enhanced respiratory burst, degranulation and prolonged lifespan) and describe the recently recognised process of de-priming, correlating in vitro observations with in vivo significance.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and disease progression are poorly understood, in part as a result of the lack of non-invasive methods to measure and monitor neurodegeneration in vivo. Sodium MRI is a topic of increasing interest in MS research as it allows the metabolic characterization of brain tissue in vivo, and integration with the structural information provided by 1H MRI, helping in the exploration of pathogenetic mechanisms and possibly offering insights into disease progression and monitoring of treatment outcomes. We present an up-to-date review of the sodium MRI application in MS organized into four main sections: (i) biological and pathogenetic role of sodium; (ii) brief overview of sodium imaging techniques; (iii) results of sodium MRI application in clinical studies; and (iv) future perspectives.

AB  - Summary Bright green inclusions in neutrophils have been reported as a sign of impending patient death. Here we report a series of 20 patients in whom green inclusions were identified in neutrophils or monocytes. Thirteen (65%) of the patients died within days of the detection of the inclusions. A common feature to almost all patients was ischaemic or hypoxic hepatitis which, in fatal cases, was associated with lactic acidosis. Light and electron microscopy indicated that the inclusions were lipid-rich, probably derived from lipofuscin-like material released from necrotic liver parenchymal cells. The majority of patients were known to be seriously ill at the time of detection of neutrophil inclusions. We recommend that the detection of green inclusions, which we refer to as ?critical green inclusions?, is acknowledged and reported by laboratories and correlated with clinical findings.

AB  - Summary Preclinical evidence supports targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To support ongoing clinical development of an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody, we have investigated for the first time the mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of a blocking anti-murine C5aR (anti-mC5aR) surrogate antibody in mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). First, efficacy was demonstrated in a multiple-dose treatment study. Almost complete inhibition of clinical disease progression was obtained, including reduced bone and cartilage destruction in anti-mC5aR-treated mice. Then, the mechanism of action was examined by looking for early effects of anti-mC5aR treatment in single-dose treatment studies. We found that 48?h after single-dose treatment with anti-mC5aR, the neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the paws was already reduced. In addition, several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A were reduced locally in the paws, indicating reduction of local inflammation. Furthermore, dose-setting experiments supported a beneficial clinical effect of dosing above the C5aR saturation level. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrated rapid onset effects of antibody blockade of C5aR. The data have translational value in supporting the Novo Nordisk clinical trials of an anti-C5aR antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients, by identifying potential biomarkers of treatment effects as well as by providing information on pharmacodynamics and novel insights into the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody blockade of C5aR.
