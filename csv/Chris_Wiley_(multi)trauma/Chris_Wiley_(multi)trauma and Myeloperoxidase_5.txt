AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol exposure is known to sensitize acinar cells to various insults but the pathophysiological mechanisms of alcoholic pancreatitis remain unknown. Alcohol abuse has been shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory response and periods of immune suppression seem to be associated with organ injury and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts transcriptional activities in the rat pancreas and how alcohol alters the inflammatory response. Using the Lieber?DeCarli alcohol/control diet, rats that were fed with alcohol over 14 weeks demonstrated a decrease of inflammatory cells in pancreatic tissue compared to controls. The anti-inflammatory effects of alcohol were confirmed by decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-1?, IL-18, TGF?, and MCP-1. In addition, alcohol significantly increased the activity of PPAR?, which is a known anti-inflammatory transcription factor, while pro-inflammatory factors including AP-2 and EGR-1 were significantly suppressed. NF?B binding showed a tendency towards a reduction. Electron microscopy studies revealed enlarged and injured mitochondria and lysosomes, accompanied by peri-cellular fibrosis. Furthermore, alcohol exposure increased the activities of trypsin and cathepsin B, both known to be critical in initiating acinar cell injury and pancreatitis. Despite the known alcohol-mediated acinar cell and mitochondrial injury, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway was attenuated. These data demonstrate that the pancreas exposed to alcohol maintains an anti-inflammatory state by activating PPAR?. Intracellular mitochondrial and lysosomal damage after chronic alcohol exposure induces premature activation of digestive enzymes and establishment of peri-cellular fibrosis in the absence of inflammation.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) often leads to high mortality, and there is as yet no effective drug treatment. The present study aimed to investigate protective effects of mogroside IIIE (MGIIIE, a cucurbitane-type triterpenoid from Siraitia grosvenorii Fruits) in experimental ALI and its underlying mechanism. MGIIIE (1, 10 0r 20 mg/kg) was orally administered for 1 h before a single intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg). MGIIIE treatment dose-dependently suppressed pulmonary oedema, pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α and HMGB1) release and higher MPO activity in lung tissues induced by LPS challenge. Molecular researches showed that mogroside IIIE (20 mg/kg) not only increased the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but suppressed the over-expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). In addition, MGIIIE also inhibited the activation of MAPKs and nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) signalling in lung tissues from LPS-challenged mice. Similar antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE were obtained in LPS-treated macrophages. Compound C (a pharmacological AMPK inhibitor) obviously reversed the antiinflammatory effect of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI mice. Taken together, AMPK activation plays a crucial role in the antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI by down-regulating TLR4/MAPK/NF-?B signalling pathways.

AB  - Summary Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiency.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.
