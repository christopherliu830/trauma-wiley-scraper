AB  - ABSTRACT The elevation of tissue pO2 induced by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a physiological stimulus that elicits a variety of cellular responses. These effects are largely mediated by, or in response to, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The major consequences of elevated RONS include increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity, and modulation of redox-sensitive cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, these phenomena underlie both the therapeutic and potentially toxic effects of HBO. Emerging evidence indicates that supporting mitochondrial health is a potential method of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of, and preventing oxygen toxicity during, HBO. This review will focus on the cellular consequences of HBO, and explore how these processes mediate a delicate balance of cellular protection versus damage. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract To facilitate research cooperation among the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, ISAC supported the Epona Cytometry Conference in eastern Hungary near Debrecen and the Hortobágy National Park. This was the first ISAC sponsored conference held in Hungary. The 150 attendees included scientists from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. There was also representation from Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Presentations and posters were of typically high ISAC quality. In addition, the Epona meeting attracted an impressive selection of commercial exhibits that provided contacts and improved the awareness of advanced analytical cytology for the attendees. The Epona conference was organized with Hungarian passion and skill by Professor Sandor Damjanovich, Dr. Jànos Szollosi, and the members of the Biophysics and Cell Biology Department of the Medical School of Debrecen. The Department has been active in cytometry for over 20 years, and in hosting the conference, it also celebrated the 20th anniversary of its installment of the first cell sorter in Eastern Europe. The successful meeting demonstrates that Hungarians are strong contenders for the organization of future ISAC meetings. During my 1999 Fulbright Scholarship in Professor Damjanovich's Department, I traveled extensively and can verify that there are other unique sites in Hungary?Sopron, Pécs, Lake Balaton, and Budapest?for ISAC meetings. The site of the conference was on the Hungarian Puszta or plain near the Hortobágy National Park, which offered tours to observe ?Hungarian Cowboys,? long-horned cattle, twisted-horn sheep, hairy pigs, and water buffalo, which were brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Magyars. Located in beautiful grasslands on the edge of the Park, the Epona Village was an excellent site for the meeting and is distinctly Hungarian. The timing of the conference was dramatic. Hungary was admitted to NATO in April and the Kosovo conflict with Yugoslavia began a few weeks later. During the conference, NATO air raids into Kosovo were being conducted from bases in southern Hungary. There was much concerned discussion among the attendees of the Kosovo situation. All regretted the loss of life, and all shared the hope that creating cooperative projects in science, agriculture, business, and education will lower international tension. In supporting the Epona conference, ISAC contributed importantly to cooperative science.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - Summary: The T-helper 17 (Th17) lineage is a recently described subset of memory T cells that is characterized by its CD4+ status and its ability to make a constellation of cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. Although most extensively described in the autoimmunity literature, there is growing evidence that the Th17 lineage plays a significant role in mediating host mucosal immunity to a number of pulmonary pathogens. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of the Th17 lineage and Th17 cytokines in mediating mucosal immunity to both pulmonary and gastrointestinal pathogens. While we have the strongest evidence that the Th17 lineage is centrally involved in mediating the host response to Gram-negative extracellular pulmonary pathogens, this literature is rapidly evolving and demonstrates a central role for Th17 cytokines both in primary infection and in recall responses seen in vaccine studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of this literature and present possible applications of Th17-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infection.
