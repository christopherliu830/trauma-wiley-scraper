AB  - Abstract Effective host defense against bacterial invasion is characterized by the vigorous recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, which is dependent on the coordinated expression of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we present evidence indicating that both C-X-C and C-C chemokines are integral components of antibacterial host defense. Specifically, in vitro studies indicate that C-X-C chemokines [interleukin-8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)] and the C-C chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α) augment the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and alveolar macrophages, respectively, to phagocytose and kill Escherichia coli. In addition, the intratracheal instillation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in CD-I mice results in time-dependent production of MIP-2 and MIP-1α, and the inhibition of MIP-2 bioactivity in vivo results in decreases in lung PMN influx, impaired bacterial clearance, and early mortality. Finally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is also expressed within the lung during the evolution of Klebsiella pneumonia, and neutralization of IL-10 in vivo results in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and increases in both short- and long-term survival. In conclusion, our studies indicate that specific chemokines are important mediators of leukocyte recruitment and/or activation in bacterial pneumonia and that the expression of these chemokines is regulated by endogenously produced IL-10.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.

AB  - Abstract With modern risk-adapted therapy, over 80% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in high-income countries (HICs) are cured. In countries with limited resources, however, therapy results for pediatric ALL are still not encouraging. We describe our experience in treating children with ALL using a risk-adapted protocol at a tertiary referral center in Lebanon. From May 2002 to August 2009, 111 consecutive patients 1?21 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL received the CCCL ALL protocol which was based on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV Study. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years 5 months. The male to female ratio was 1.5. Forty-six patients received the intermediate-/high-risk arm and 65 received the low-risk arm. Only one patient (0.9%) died during induction therapy. Relapse occurred in 8 (7.2%) patients. Eight (7.2%) patients died, 4 of whom were in remission. The median follow-up of the patients was 38 months. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were and 88.5% (95% CI: 77.1?94.4) and 78.7% (95% CI: 69.8?88.4), respectively. Our results are comparable to those in HICs in spite of the limited resources and the relatively low socioeconomic status of the Lebanese population. Children treated on this protocol experienced significant toxicity necessitating expert supportive care, but benefited from improved cure rates and prolonged survival. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract In this review, a general introduction to biological oxidants (focusing on reactive oxygen species, ROS) and the biomedical rationale behind the development of materials capable of responding to ROS is provided. The state of the art for preparative aspects and mechanistic responses of the most commonly used macromolecular ROS-responsive systems, including polysulfides, polyselenides, polythioketals, polyoxalates, and also oligoproline- and catechol-based materials, is subsequently given. The endowment of multiple responsiveness, with specific emphasis on the cases where a molecular logic gate behavior can be obtained, is focused on. Finally, fundamental open issues, which include implications of the ?drug?-like character of ROS-responsive materials (inherent anti-inflammatory behavior) and the poor quantitative understanding of ROS roles in biology, are discussed.
