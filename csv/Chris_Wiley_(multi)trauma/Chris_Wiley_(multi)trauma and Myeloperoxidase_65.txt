AB  - An initiative to bring wound care ?back to the bedside? was introduced in a large teaching hospital. Wound consultation was available from either a nurse or physician member of a hospital-based wound team. Confusion over whom to consult coupled with multiple product options led to decreased critical thinking at the bedside. The volume of consultations precluded follow-up visits by the team, further fragmenting care. The proposed solution included partnering with a sole vendor to standardize wound products and assist with education on product selection and function. New policies and procedures were created. Each patient unit was staffed by a Nurse clinical specialist as part of a hospital-wide ?Magnet? application process. This individual assumed the role of ?skin care leader? and was required to attend two in-depth educational programs. All skin care leaders were required to become part of a hospital-wide quarterly prevalence and incidence project. The wound nurse assumed a more ?consultative? role for the skin care leaders who subsequently assisted the end user in this model; the bedside nurse. This paradigm shift in care did not result in any statistically significant changes in wound incidence and reintroduced skin care as an integral component of the assessment and care for the bedside nurse. This presentation will describe the process in detail. Acknowledgments:? This study was supported with an educational grant from Smith and Nephew, Largo, FL.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - The Thermage system is a radiofrequency (RF) device designed to treat human skin. The Thermage ThermaCool TC? is a noninvasive, nonablative, nonlaser system that combines cryogen cooling and radiofrequency (RF) energy to volumetrically heat dermal and subdermal tissue. Thermage treatment causes collagen contraction resulting in immediate skin tightening. It has also been clinically shown to tighten skin over time. This long-term tightening effect is believed to result from the body?s wound healing response. We performed studies in a juvenile pig to characterize the wound healing response after ThermaCool treatment in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular events resulting from treatment. Histological markers of the wound healing process were examined over a 1-month period. Collagen gene expression was examined by quantitative PCR. Macrophages and mast cells are important inflammatory cell types that stimulate fibroblast recruitment, collagen synthesis and blood vessel growth. Three to 5 days following treatment, macrophages and mast cells were present in the dermis. By 28 days, both increased dermal blood vessel density and epidermal thickness was observed. Collagen I and collagen III genes were expressed at elevated levels by 21 days posttreatment. ThermaCool? treatment stimulates dermal remodeling by initiating a wound-healing response. This study demonstrates that thermage treatment results in the recruitment of important cellular mediators of wound healing and increased collagen synthesis in an animal model. These events are presumed to be responsible for dermal remodeling and skin tightening over time in human subjects. Because the Thermage device noninvasively delivers heat energy, it may be a unique tool for the examination of aseptic thermally induced wound models.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - The potential to lower destructively high levels of elastase found in chronic wounds with oleic acid-treated cotton wound dressings was assessed and compared with two types of oleic acid-treated occlusive wound dressings. The ability of albumin to bind oleic acid and transfer elastase inhibitory activity from the dressing material to elastase in solution was examined. Cotton, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid wound dressings were treated with oleic acid and tested for their ability to lower elastase activity. Oleic acid?treated cotton gauzes, hydrogels, and hydrocolloid dressings were found to release oleic acid in the presence of albumin in sufficient quantities to inhibit elastase activity. The order of elastase lowering activity with the three oleic acid-formulated wound dressings was cotton gauze?>?hydrogel?>?hydrocolloid. Elastase inhibition by oleic acid displaced from gauze followed a dose response profile. In contrast Cathepsin G, when displaced by albumin, was inhibited within a narrow range of oleic acid formulations. The effect of albumin levels representative of the chronic wound on displacement of oleic acid was determined. Solubilization of cotton bound oleic acid by albumin was found to be most effective at 4% albumin. However, there was sufficient solubilization of oleic acid at the 2% albumin levels found in chronic wound fluid to achieve a significant elastase-lowering effect. Albumin promoted solubilization of oleic acid from cotton with a solubility threshold of 27?mg/g cotton gauze. Equivalent lowering of elastase activity was found with 1%, 2%, and 4% albumin concentrations with oleic acid on cotton at 128?mg oleic acid/gram of cotton.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.
