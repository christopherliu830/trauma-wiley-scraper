AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.

AB  - Background:? Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a novel method for producing a strong tissue-tissue seal using photosensitization. PTB cross-links tissues without causing thermal damage, although the mechanism of action in skin is not completely understood. Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered skin construct, is currently applied to chronic wounds and fixed in place by bolster, suture, staple, or glue. We postulated that PTB may have application for attaching Apligraf to skin. Materials and Methods:? An ex vivo model was used to characterize bonding of Apligraf and skin by PTB. Argon laser (514?nm) or IPL irradiation in the presence of the photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal was used to bond Apligraf and human cadaveric or porcine skin. Various outcome measurements were made to evaluate the efficacy and histological characteristics of the bonding. Conclusions:? Photochemical tissue bonding of Apligraf to human skin can be performed and further characterization is under way. Potential applications of PTB and Apligraf include the treatment of acute wounds, split thickness skin graft donor sites, burns, and debrided chronic wounds.

AB  - The understanding of bioengineered tissue has evolved over the past 5 years. Now considered ?cell therapy,? bioengineered tissue can provide a nonhealing wound with the appropriate complement of cytokines, growth factors, and healthy cells to promote the patient?s healing process. As clinicians have gained experience with Apligraf*, the process of wound bed preparation has proven to be a critical step in order to achieve optimal outcomes with the tissue construct. Recently, the investigators have evaluated a novel device, MIST? ultrasound , recently FDA cleared for the cleansing and debriding of wounds. A subgroup from a total of 23 patients in a research trial using MIST therapy for nonhealing wounds received an Apligraf as part of their treatment regimen. The'bioengineered tissue remained intact for a full 4 weeks postapplication and the appearance of the graft was quite different than our prior experience with the product. On removal of the wound/graft eschar, patients had achieved complete epithelialization. This report describes the patients who underwent this combination of technologies along with wound photographs, measurements and patient histories. As we learn more about the biochemistry of healing we are able to ?look? at how we combine and use advanced wound care technologies. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Wound healing is a multistep process that concludes with scar formation. A common clinical observation is that oral wounds exhibit privileged healing compared to extra-oral wounds. Current data demonstrates reduced inflammation and more rapid reepithelialization of oral wounds suggesting that reduced inflammation is vital to privileged repair. To examine the initiation of inflammation, the present study examines IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα production by oral versus cutaneous keratinocytes and compares mast cell infiltration in oral versus cutaneous wounds. Two 1?mm diameter excisional wounds were placed on the lateral tongue or dorsal skin of anesthetized BALB/c mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, wound tissue was harvested for analysis. Cytokine expression levels were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin. At every time point, levels of IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα mRNA were less in oral than dermal wounds. When analyzed by ELISA, IL-1 protein levels peaked at 6 hours in both oral and cutaneous wounds, yet the levels were lower in oral wounds. Mast cell infiltration was measured by counting toluidine blue positive cells in fixed wound sections. The number of mast cells/mm2 was decreased overall in oral mucosal wounds. These findings suggest that a decreased early inflammatory response to injury may be responsible for the privileged repair of oral mucosa.

AB  - Advocate Christ hospital is a 650-bed, level-one tertiary-care center that created a comprehensive wound care program in November 1998. Over the first 3 years of the program there were over 140 admissions per year directly from the wound center along with numerous hospital to hospital transfers for complex wound management. Prevalence rates therefore increased linearly over this time frame. The wound team calculated a system-wide (eight hospitals) spend of $2.1 million per year for specialty rental beds. Incidence rates for the system were at, but not lower than, national levels despite the high cost incurred. A $1.3 million capital purchase for KCI atmos-air 9000? mattresses resulted in the complete replacement of all medical surgical beds in all eight hospitals. An internal prevalence and incidence team was created and data were collected both at the hospital and system-wide level on a quarterly basis. Hospital and system incidence rates fell to or below 7%(targeted goal) and the entire project will achieve a return on investment in 18 months. Data to be presented include prevalence and incidence results, rental bed costs pre- and postbed purchase, and a detailed review of the process of creating an electronic prevalence and incidence tracking system.

AB  - Previous wound healing studies have attempted to improve angiogenesis (new blood vessel ingrowth). Recent studies suggest, however, that revascularization of wounds may also be accomplished by vasculogenesis: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow and blood that home to sites of tissue damage and form new blood vessels. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic and topical transplantation of EPCs for wound healing in an in vivo rabbit model. It was hypothesized that applying cells topically through an EPC-seeded albumin scaffold may promote revascularization from inside the wound versus only from the periphery. Further, it was hypothesized that combining topical and systemic transplantation of EPCs may increase vessel formation from both directions. Full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of New Zealand White rabbits. Wounds were treated with either an EPC-seeded scaffold, nonseeded scaffold, or no treatment (control). Additionally, half of the animals were given systemic injections of EPCs. Digital pictures were taken weekly until sacrifice to determine healing rates. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging scans were used to measure changes in blood perfusion during healing. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 4 weeks; wounds were excised and prepared for histological examination. Histomorphometry was used to calculate epithelialization and contraction rates, as well as the volume fraction of cell nuclei and blood vessels. Preliminary results suggest that animals that received systemic transplantations of EPCs had higher overall healing rates than those with no injection. Systemic transplantation alone improved healing over the control by the end of 2 weeks. When combined with a topical scaffold (both EPC-seeded and nonseeded), systemically injected cells showed improved healing by the end of the first week. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Electroporation of cells leads to breakdown of the ion gradients and release of intracellular contents. This triggers edema, which raises the local hydration level over its physiological value. Therefore, the state of water in an injured tissue is changed and the compartmentalization and dynamics of the spin populations during magnetic relaxation differ from healthy tissue. Methods:? We measured spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin density (M0) parameters of water protons in electroporated rat muscles by using a 4.7-Tesla GE/Bruker Omega scanner. The rats were sacrificed 3?h postshock and extensor digitorum longus, soleus and biceps femoris muscles were collected. Contralateral muscle samples served as controls. T2 and M0 were obtained using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill methods. Following MR imaging the water content in the tissue samples was measured. To infer T2 from the value corresponding to bulk water we also measured T2 of lysozyme and ribonuclease(1?mM) solutions (10?mM phosphate buffer at pH?=?7.0) as a function of protein concentration. Results:? T2 values were determined by fitting the signal amplitude from the echoes to the decay time. We obtained for deionized distilled water T2?=?614?±?31?ms, for lysozyme, T2?=?478?±?25?ms and for ribonuclease A, T2?=?423?±?22?ms. The analysis of T2-weighted MR images in rat muscles showed a 25?75% increase of the water T2 relaxation time in the three different muscle samples, of which soleus muscle showed the largest increase of 75%, from ?40?ms in controls to ?70?ms in injured muscles. Conclusions:? Electroporation leads to increased in T2, which may have two components. First, the accumulated water adds extra hydration layers to proteins. Second, the dynamics of water molecules may be altered as a result of development of the structural damage due to activation of degradative processes in the tissue.

AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.
