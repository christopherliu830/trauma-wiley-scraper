AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

AB  - Clinical Problem:? An 89-year-old white male presented to his dermatologist with a pressure ulcer on his left medial foot. He was not a surgical candidate (CHF, pacemaker, edema) and not diabetic. Past Management:? For 2 years the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies treating the wound with regular debridements and Regranex therapy. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91 the patient developed osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapies were initiated. Current Clinical Approach:? In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3?ml/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLOSD) as the patient ambulated. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3????4? island dressing. Patient Outcomes:? After 3 weeks of continuous oxygen and antibiotic therapies the patient was able to ambulate without pain. The planned amputation was canceled. The wound bed was characterized by new granulation tissue and reepithelialization. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 30 days, but the tiny, 2 ounce oxygen therapy device was continued until full wound closure 11 weeks later. The wound remained closed for 36 months, the remainder of the patient?s life. Conclusions:? The effectiveness of the antibiotics in this patient as well as other oxygen-sensitive wound healing processes may have been potentiated and enhanced by the continuous availability of oxygen at this dosage. Further carefully controlled studies of transdermal sustained oxygen delivery for the treatment of chronic wounds with osteomyelitis are needed to clarify the underlying scientific mechanisms of this beneficial effect. The support of Ogenix Corporation in supplying EpiFLOSD for this project is appreciated.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - The potential to lower destructively high levels of elastase found in chronic wounds with oleic acid-treated cotton wound dressings was assessed and compared with two types of oleic acid-treated occlusive wound dressings. The ability of albumin to bind oleic acid and transfer elastase inhibitory activity from the dressing material to elastase in solution was examined. Cotton, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid wound dressings were treated with oleic acid and tested for their ability to lower elastase activity. Oleic acid?treated cotton gauzes, hydrogels, and hydrocolloid dressings were found to release oleic acid in the presence of albumin in sufficient quantities to inhibit elastase activity. The order of elastase lowering activity with the three oleic acid-formulated wound dressings was cotton gauze?>?hydrogel?>?hydrocolloid. Elastase inhibition by oleic acid displaced from gauze followed a dose response profile. In contrast Cathepsin G, when displaced by albumin, was inhibited within a narrow range of oleic acid formulations. The effect of albumin levels representative of the chronic wound on displacement of oleic acid was determined. Solubilization of cotton bound oleic acid by albumin was found to be most effective at 4% albumin. However, there was sufficient solubilization of oleic acid at the 2% albumin levels found in chronic wound fluid to achieve a significant elastase-lowering effect. Albumin promoted solubilization of oleic acid from cotton with a solubility threshold of 27?mg/g cotton gauze. Equivalent lowering of elastase activity was found with 1%, 2%, and 4% albumin concentrations with oleic acid on cotton at 128?mg oleic acid/gram of cotton.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.

AB  - SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine), a matricellular glycoprotein, modulates the interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix. Studies in null-mice revealed a role of SPARC in wound healing. Here we examined the effect of SPARC in a skin-humanized mouse wound healing model. This model is based in the regeneration of human skin onto the back of nude mice by transplantation of a dermo-epidermal equivalent. The regenerated human skin was excisionally wounded with biopsy punches. At the moment of wounding an adenoviral vector encoding the cDNA for SPARC was intradermally injected. We are currently assessing the effects of in vivo gene transfer of SPARC at the wound site in the healing process. Criticals events of wound healing including reepithelialization, regeneration of dermoepidermal junction and dermal remodeling were studied at different time points postwounding.

AB  - Hypertrophic scarring is a pathological process characterized by a fibroblastic hyperproliferation and by an excess of deposition of extracellular matrix components. Hypothesis of abnormalities in epidermal-dermal cross talk has been laid down to explain this pathology. To check this affirmation, we used a tissue-engineered model of self-assembly reconstructed skin in order to mimic interactions between dermal and epidermal cells in normal or pathological skin. We performed those skin equivalents with three dermal cell types : normal wound (Wmyo) or hypertrophic wound (Hmyo) myofibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts (Fb). Epidermis was reconstructed with normal skin keratinocytes (NK), hypertrophic scars keratinocytes (HK), or without any keratinocytes. In the absence of epidermis, Hmyo formed a thicker dermis than Wmyo. When seeded with NK, the dermal thickness of Hmyo and Fb dermis was significantly reduced while that of Wmyo was increased. However, the presence of HK always induced thicker dermis formation than observed with NK. HK also increase the production of extracellular matrix and reduce its degradation in comparison with NK. In addition, HK have more influence on dermal cells proliferation than NK. In conclusion, HK may play a more important role on fibrosis development than NK. The keratinocytes have distinct secretory patterns depending on their skin source. Wmyo and Hmyo do not react the same way to the presence of keratinocytes. These observations strongly suggest that HK have a more important role on pathological fibrosis development by influencing dermal cells behavior. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an ubiquitous enzyme produced by different cell types. Previous reports have demonstrated ALP induction by extracellular matrix, ascorbic acid or IL-6. Using histochemical techniques, we evaluated the ex vivo activity of ALP in incisional and excisional acute wounds, chronic wounds, and keloids in animal and human models. We also compared in situ ALP activity with type I/III collagen levels using histological methods (Herovici technique). Results demonstrated that 1) during the first stage of acute wound healing the increase in ALP activity precedes high levels of type III collagen, meanwhile type I collagen diminishes. When ALP activity disappears, the proportion of type I/III collagen returns to normal. 2) ALP activity is almost null in chronic wounds, which are characterized by thick type I collagen fibers and some type III collagen throughout the tissue. However, when the wound is treated, ALP activity rises to maximum levels together with type III collagen, but type I collagen is absent. 3) In keloids ALP activity is also absent; however when the scar is treated with a proinflammatory cytokine downmodulator (collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone) endogenous type I collagen diminishes, while type III collagen and ALP activity are increased. Based on the above results we suggest that ALP activity is an acute inflammation marker since the enzyme levels are increased in acute wounds but not in chronic inflammation processes. Nevertheless, when chronic lesions or scars are in the process of healing, the increase in ALP activity is clear. And as a result, we believe that treatments for chronic wounds or scars induce acute inflammation and consequently stimulate wound repair or fibrolysis. In conclusion, ALP activity is an important factor to be considered in acute and chronic wound repair and their healing process.

AB  - Introduction:? Accurate wound size measurement is vital to assessment of progressive healing. Lack of an accepted ?gold standard? is a major obstacle to assessment of any effective wound management regimen. Methodology:? Sixteen pelvic region pressure ulcers were monitored weekly for 3 weeks. All wounds were stage III or IV, equally divided between sacral and ischial locations. Linear wound size was measured using the Decubitus Disposable Measuring Guide (DDMG). Wound size index was defined as the sum of the linear dimensions. Wound volume was determined by filling the covered wound cavity with fluid; the volume of saline required to fill the wound was a direct measure of wound volume. Results and Discussion:? Correlation between the two measurement methods was determined utilizing Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient. Wound size index decreased significantly (p?<?0.01) over the study period. Wound volume changes were nonsignificant. Closer evaluation of assessment methodology found missing wound volume data, due primarily to patient positioning difficulties. All missing data points were for ischial wounds. Wound absorption of measurement fluid and residual fluid in the wound prior to measurement could not be determined. Wound size index may be influenced by subjective evaluation of wound boundaries. Conclusion:? Wound size index significantly discriminated longitudinal changes in wound size, while volume measurements did not. Wound volume measurements have greater measurement errors than wound size index. Acknowledgments:? Support for this study was provided by the Veterans Administration Rehabilitation Research and Development Service.

AB  - Acute wounds caused by the severe and extensive infection such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci or MRSA may be life-threatening in immunocompromised hosts such as steroid users or those with venostasis in the lower legs. The principle of the treatment is the removal of the primary pathogens, however, difficulties of the lower leg reconstruction remain due to the tissue loss and the deficiency of the circulation system after extensive soft tissue debridement. For 10 immediately-developing extensive lower extremity cases, artificial skin substitutes composed of dried bilayer membranes of outer silicone membrane and inner porcine-tendon derived collagen layer (Pelnac?, Gunze Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were immediately after extensive and meticulous debridement. While the skin substitute integrated into the wound bed for maximally 3 weeks, total 20 micrograms of the basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)(Trafermin?, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were applied by the 27-Gage syringe daily. The outer membranes were removed and thin partial thickness skin grafting (9?10/1,000 inches) was performed and wound healed uneventfully. The bFGF-treated skin texture was significantly softer compared to control by a durometer (Teclock?, GS-701N, Tokyo, Japan)(p?<?0.01), which was a measuring device elastic hard products such as rubbers and polymers. Reconstruction using the porcine-derived artificial skin substitute in the lower extremities after extensive debridement was safe, easy, and reproducible. The quality of the wounds with bFGF significantly improves the healed skin texture.

AB  - A Laser Speckle Perfusion Imaging (LSPI) system has been developed to achieve rapid, high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of tissue blood flow. This study was designed to evaluate LSPI for monitoring dermal blood flow during the wound healing process in a well-established porcine model. Full-thickness excisional wounds (2???2?cm) were created on the dorsal skin of 11 juvenile female red Duroc pigs. The skin wounds were imaged weekly with the LSPI system until day 49 postwounding. Blood flow values for the wounds were normalized using the values from the surrounding healthy skin to account for variations in systemic perfusion from one scan date to the next. An average normalized perfusion value was obtained from the scans of all animals for each time point. Wound perfusion at the time of reepithelialization reached ?165% of the surrounding skin (p?<?0.001). This elevation in wound perfusion slowly and steadily decreased over time, until day 49 postwounding, at which time the values returned to normal. This trend toward decreased wound perfusion over time has previously been reported in human burn wounds using the LSPI instrument. Further, the LSPI data from this study and from other human studies correlates well with data generated using the more widely established Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) technique. The faster scan time and higher resolution of the LSPI method provides a distinct clinical advantage, both in terms of patient comfort and for reliably matching perfusion characteristics to their associated anatomical features. The fast temporal response of the LSPI instrument could be used to monitor vascular responses to mechanical or pharmacological interventions to study dynamic vascular changes to damaged tissues. This study validates LSPI as a tool to measure blood flow in skin wounds and further supports the use of the juvenile female pig as a model of excisional wound healing, yielding results comparable to healing in humans.
