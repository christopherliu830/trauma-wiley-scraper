AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Introduction:? Based on the results of a study showing increased healing rates in a rabbit wound healing model, a clinical study was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of a new electric stimulation bandage (POSiFECT dressing). Four patients have completed the study for the first-generation system and two are currently enrolled in the evaluation of the second-generation system. Materials and Methods:? Spinal cord-injured pressure ulcer patients were treated with the POSiFECT dressing in a randomized double-blind crossover study. During the first 8 weeks, subjects received a dressing supplying 50??A of current or one with an unconnected battery. During the treatment, bandages were changed every other day and wounds were assessed weekly to determine size, depth, and condition. At the end of 8 weeks the patients were unblinded and the control group was treated with working bandages for 8 weeks. After cessation of treatment, assessments continued each month for 2 months. Results:? The treatment led to statistically significant increases in healing rates during the first week (0.19?±?0.11?cm/wk) and the first 2 weeks (0.10?±?0.07?cm/wk) compared to both the control group (?0.03?±?0.0?cm/wk) and the follow-up period (?0.02?±?0.08?cm/wk). For each patient, however, there was a time frame during the 3rd to 5th week of treatment in which significant decreases in healing rate occurred (?0.31 to ?0.096). Conclusions:? The POSiFECT dressing appears to increase healing during the first few weeks after application. A modified clinical study is under way with a new dressing design as well as a treatment protocol providing 3 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks without stimulation and then 3 more weeks of stimulation.

AB  - Several lines of evidence demonstrate that limited inflammation is key for scarless healing to take place in early fetal skin. Because inflammation and angiogenesis are often linked in pathological processes, we hypothesized that angiogenesis may play a significant role in the regulation of scar formation. A mouse model of fetal wound repair was utilized to study angiogenesis in wounds generated at either embryonic day 15 (E15), when scarless healing takes place, or embryonic day 18 (E18), when significant scarring occurs. CD31 immunohistochemical staining and image analysis were used to calculate blood vessel density at 7 days post-wounding. Wounds generated at E15 showed no increase in vessel density above levels found in unwounded, age-matched skin. In contrast, wounds generated at E18 displayed a 45% increase in vessel density compared to control skin, similar to what is seen during adult wound healing. Increased protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 day wounds generated at E18 (8.06?±?1.89?pg VEGF/?g protein compared to 1.99?±?0.4 in wounds made at E15) likely contribute to the increase in vascularity. In addition, injection of E15 wounds with 0.05??g of VEGF resulted in the production of a scar, compared to control wounds which healed without a scar. To further explore the idea that VEGF may contribute to scarring, we examined the effects of VEGF neutralization on scar formation in adult murine skin. Anti-VEGF antibody injections resulted in a significant reduction in scar formation compared to control scars based on histological and ultrastructural analysis. Our studies suggest a novel role for VEGF in promoting scar tissue deposition, and suggest that VEGF inhibitors may be useful for limiting cutaneous fibrosis.

AB  - Hypothesis:? Both hypoxia and lactate independently induce VEGF synthesis. However, an adequate supply of oxygen is required for new vessels to mature. Materials and Methods:? We used in vivo matrigel (growth factor reduced) angiogenesis assay and Swiss Webster mice n?=?36 (3 groups of 12 with 6 control and 6 experimental in each). Each mouse received a 1?ml subcutaneous matrigel injection. Matrigel solidifies into a gel implant when injected subcutaneously. Control injections/implants were matrigel with no added substance and experimental implants were matrigel supplemented with 30?mgs of crushed lactate polymer or PL (poly DL-Lactide-co-Glycolide 50:50; av. mol.wt. 50?75,000 kilo Daltons). The first group of mice was maintained in 12?14% oxygen, the second group in 21% oxygen, and the third group in 50?52% oxygen continuously for 11 days, at which time the implants were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with Mason?s Trichrome to identify new vessels and collagen. Results:? 1.?13% oxygen control: Half showed new blood vessels with thin or incomplete walls and hemorrhages. Few collagen fibers 2.?13% oxygen with PL: same as above 3.?21% oxygen control: none showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 4.?21% oxygen with PL: five out of six showed new blood vessels. Almost all were mature, with complete walls, collagen fibers, and no hemorrhages 5.?51% oxygen control: None showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 6.?51% oxygen with PL: all six developed new vessels with some hemorrhage seen in two out of six. Collagen fibers present Note: matrigel contains collagen and stained a pale blue, collagen fibers were seen as dark blue, endothelial cells and RBCs as dark red and red. All blood vessels contained RBCs. Conclusions:? Hypoxia and lactate induce VEGF. However, hypoxia limits vascular growth by inhibiting collagen deposition. The largest and most mature new vessels result from a combination of oxygen and lactate.

AB  - It has been postulated that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species detected in fluids and biopsies of chronic wounds contribute to the failure of wound to heal by degrading essential growth factors, receptors and extracellular matrix proteins. This stimulated the development of a formulation containing metal ions (polyhydrated ionogen or PHI) and citric acid that reduced reactive oxygen species in cultures of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (J Wound Care 12:10, 2003). The effect of PHI on synthesis of MMPs was studied in cultures of tumor cells and human dermal fibroblasts. Dose response curves of PHI ranging from 0.02% to 10%(W/V) established no toxicity in cultures of human dermal fibroblasts after 24 hours of incubation with PHI at concentrations below 1.25%, as measured by MTT assay. Levels of MMP-2 activity measured by antibody capture assay were reduced approximately 80% in culture medium of Mor-86 glioma tumor cells after 24 hours of exposure to 1% PHI. These results suggest that PHI reduced the synthesis of MMP-2 protein, presumably by reducing transcription and/or translation of MMP-2 gene. Clinical case reports of chronic wounds treated by PHI dressing (DerMax) suggest that PHI treatment stimulated healing and reduced MMP-2 immunostaining in biopsies of the chronic wounds.

AB  - Scarless fetal wound healing in connective tissue is characterized by organized collagen deposition that leads to regeneration and apparently normal tissue structure and function. In contrast, adult wound healing is characterized by the deposition of unorganized collagen that leads to scar formation and a loss of functionally relevant structural organization. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules, and the subsequent remodeling and contraction during the wound healing process. Therefore, fibroblasts play a key role in the different outcomes observed in fetal and adult wound healing. The hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts, relative to adult fibroblasts, have an altered capacity to contract collagen gels and remodel collagen fibrils due to inherent differences in their contractile phenotype. In this study, an anchored collagen gel model was used to evaluate matrix contraction and remodeling by these different fibroblast phenotypes. Video microscopy was used to measure the changes in surface area of contracting collagen gels. Collagen gel reorganization was evaluated using a fitting algorithm to predict the distribution and orientation of collagen fibrils from scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, fibroblast morphology and proliferation on contracting collagen gels were examined. Understanding these phenotypic variations will elucidate key differences in the wound healing process that can be used for potential clinical applications involving cell therapy and tissue engineered constructs.
