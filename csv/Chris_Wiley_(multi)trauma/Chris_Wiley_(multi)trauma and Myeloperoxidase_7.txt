AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Use of photostimulation including low-level light emitting diode (LED) therapy has broadened greatly in recent years because it is compact, portable, and easy to use. Here, the effects of photostimulation by LED (610 nm) therapy on ischemic brain damage was investigated in mice in which treatment started after a stroke in a clinically relevant setting. The mice underwent LED therapy (20 min) twice a day for 3 days, commencing at 4 hours post-ischemia. LED therapy group generated a significantly smaller infarct size and improvements in neurological function based on neurologic test score. LED therapy profoundly reduced neuroinflammatory responses including neutrophil infiltration and microglia activation in the ischemic cortex. LED therapy also decreased cell death and attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome, in accordance with down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and IL-18 in the ischemic brain. Moreover, the mice with post-ischemic LED therapy showed suppressed TLR-2 levels, MAPK signaling and NF-kB activation. These findings suggest that by suppressing the inflammasome, LED therapy can attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and tissue damage following ischemic stroke. Therapeutic interventions targeting the inflammasome via photostimulation with LED may be a novel approach to ameliorate brain injury following ischemic stroke. Effect of post-ischemic low-level light emitting diode therapy (LED-T) on infarct reduction was mediated by inflammasome suppression.
