AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations are increased in dogs with exertional rhabdomyolysis and whether concentrations are correlated with serum myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity. Design Observational cohort study. Setting Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race 2015. Animals Twelve normal competitive sled dogs; 5 dogs with rhabdomyolysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Blood was collected from all confirmed cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis and compared to the winning team at the midrace point. Results indicate that median cfDNA did not increase, but decreased by the race finish (prerace = 314.2 ng/mL versus midrace = 283.7 ng/mL versus postrace = 249.5 ng/mL). There were no rises in median cfDNA in dogs with rhabdomyolysis (255 ng/mL) negating its potential utility as a measure of acute skeletal muscle compromise. In contrast, myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity at the midrace point for normal dogs were significantly lower than dogs with rhabdomyolysis. Values for myoglobin and creatine kinase were strongly positively correlated (R = 0.91). Conclusions cfDNA is not a useful biomarker for exertional rhabdomyolysis in contrast to myoglobin and creatine kinase. Further evaluation of timing and clinical signs suggests that exertional rhabdomyolysis occurs early in endurance activities. Among the dogs with rhabdomyolysis, the dog that demonstrated clinical signs had the highest serum creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The clinical spectrum of electrical injury ranges from the absence of any external physical signs to severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain injury accompanying an electrical trauma. In this report, a case study and discussion are presented on the management and coordination of postacute care of an electrical trauma survivor. Expertise and a multi-disciplinary team are essential to cohesive patient care. Patient monitoring for progressive changes and prompt intervention are needed to address the potential difficulties experienced by trauma survivors as they rehabilitate to return to their work and their activities of daily living.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare cardiac risk stratification using a 0 and 2?h point-of-care (POC) cardiac troponin (cTn), 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers against the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn reference standard. Methods A prospective observational study of ED patients presenting with chest pain was performed. Patients were risk stratified and treated as per the Heart Foundation of Australia/Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (HF-A/CS-ANZ) guidelines using the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn (T6). Patients were further stratified using a 0 and 2?h POC cTn (T2) plus 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers (cTn, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin) (M2). The T6, T2 and M2 strategies were compared using the 30-day major adverse cardiac events as the primary outcome. Results Seven hundred and four patients (median age 54 years, male 62.1%) were enrolled. Using the T6 reference standard, 2%, 61% and 37% were stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The 30-day event rates were 0%, 3.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The T2 strategy stratified 1.5%, 57% and 41% as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 4.2% and 24.8%, respectively. The M2 strategy resulted in significantly different risk distribution with 1%, 40% and 59% stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 3.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Conclusion Using a 2?h POC cTn-only biomarker strategy with the HF-A/CS-ANZ guidelines accurately identified a population at intermediate risk of 30-day events in whom further objective testing might be accelerated, allowing subsequent early discharge of the majority of this cohort. Within 2?h of presentation a high risk population could be identified in whom early management, including admission, was required.

AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis in deceased donors usually causes acute renal failure (ARF), which may be considered a contraindication for kidney transplantation. From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15 569±8597 U/L, 37 092±42 100 ?g/L, and 422±167 ?mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2 years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3±14.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 72.3±15.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

AB  - The implantation of decellularized tissue has shown effectiveness as a strategy for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries. The preparation of decellularized tissue typically relies on the diffusion driven removal of cellular debris. For bulky tissues like muscle, the process can be lengthy, which introduces opportunities for both tissue contamination and degradation of key ECM molecules. In this study we report on the accelerated preparation of decellularized skeletal muscle (DSM) scaffolds using a infusion system and examine scaffold performance for the repair of VML injuries. The preparation of DSM scaffolds using infusion was dramatically accelerated. As the infusion rate (1% SDS) was increased from 0.1 to 1 and 10ml/hr, the time needed to remove intracellular myoglobin and actin decreased from a maximum of 140?±?3hrs to 45?±?3hrs and 10?±?2hrs respectively. Although infusion appeared to remove cellular debris more aggressively, it did not significantly decrease the collagen or glycosaminoglycan composition of DSM samples when compared to un-infused controls. Infusion prepared DSM samples retained the aligned network structure and mechanical integrity of control samples. Infusion prepared DSM samples supported the attachment and in-vitro proliferation of myoblast cells and was well tolerated by the host when examined in-vivo. ? 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

The relationship has often fostered new and often ground-breaking developments in medicine and surgery. The last decade of conflict has been no different. Understanding the history and principles of war surgery is paramount to its practice. This chapter aims to distil the salient practices learnt from recent conflicts through understanding of what wounds soldiers at war and the compounding factors that make surgery more arduous in war conditions. Furthermore, the chapter will give a concise understanding of blast and penetrating injury and develop this in the methods of applying plastic and reconstructive surgery military surgical teams.

AB  - Abstract The urine chemistry analysis in dogs and cats is performed using commercially available urine chemistry test strips impregnated with colorimetric reagents. Several semi-automated instruments are commercially available for reading reagent test strips. The urine protein pad contains pH-based indicator dye at acidic pH and, when bound to the amino groups of negatively charged proteins, it changes color. Results of the urine test pad are often interpreted in conjunction with the urine specific gravity because the concentration of the urine protein is closely associated with the concentration or dilution of the urine. The test pad detects the presence of glucose by an enzymatic reaction involving glucose oxidase that results in a color change proportional to the amount of glucose present. The dipstick test pad for blood contains a peroxidase substrate which reacts with heme molecules contained in compounds such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, and in erythrocytes.

AB  - Abstract:? Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal disorder characterized by dystrophin absence, courses with chronic inflammation, sarcolemmal damage, and skeletal muscle degeneration. Among the multiple pathogenic mechanisms proposed for DMD, oxidative stress and inflammation are directly involved in the dystrophic process. Unfortunately, there is no current treatment for DMD, and the inflammatory process is an important target for therapies. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin, we investigated whether melatonin treatment may reduce the dystrophic process. Ten DMD patients aged 12.8?±?0.98?yr, were treated with melatonin (60?mg at 21:00?hr plus 10?mg at 09:00?hr), and plasma levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrites (NOx), interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-?, and plasma markers of muscle injury, were determined at 3, 6 and 9?months of treatment. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were used as controls. The results show a significant increase in LPO, NOx, and cytokine levels in plasma of DMD patients compared with controls. Melatonin administration reduced these values to control levels at 3?months of treatment, decreasing further 9?months later. In parallel, melatonin also reduced plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK; 50%), lactate dehydrogenase (28%), aspartate aminotransferase (28%), alanine aminotransferase (20%), and myoglobin (13%). These findings strongly support the conclusion that melatonin administration significantly reduced the hyperoxidative and inflammatory process in DMD patients, reducing the muscle degenerative process.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.

AB  - Summary Falls are common and important. This chapter assists clinicians seeing older patients presenting with falls in emergency departments, medical units, in the community, nursing homes, and on the wards in the middle of the night. Reduced mobility is a geriatric giant; and-de-conditioning is catastrophic for the frail older person who was previously managing at home in that it can lead to new institutionalisation. Key elements of this chapter include: The difference between a fall and syncope Practical advice for the on-call doctor on how to assess an inpatient who has fallen including red flags such as head injury and anticoagulation, and how to perform and document a primary and secondary survey. Grading of pressure ulcers and practical advice on their emergency management prior to review by a specialist team Information highlighting how deconditioning occurs and the consequences on length of stay and future independence Evidence on the benefit of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in preventing deconditioning. Management of patients with Parkinson's disease and neuromuscular diseases attending emergency departments and acute medical units.

AB  - Objective To determine the response of Australian cats with lymphosarcoma to chemotherapy and/or surgery in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, haematological and serum biochemical values and retroviral status. Design Prospective study of 61 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma subjected to multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. Procedure An accepted chemotherapy protocol utilising l-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate and prednisolone was modified and used to treat 60 cats with lymphosarcoma. Clinical findings were recorded before and during therapy. As far as practical, cases were followed to death, euthanasia or apparent cure. Owner satisfaction with the results of chemotherapy was determined using a questionnaire sent after the completion of chemotherapy. Results One cat, with lymphosarcoma limited to a single mandibular lymph node, was treated using surgery alone and was cured. The other 60 cats were treated using multi-agent chemotherapy, although seven cats with localised intestinal, ocular and subcutaneous lesions had these lesions partially (2 intestinal lesions) or completely (2 eyes, 2 intestinal lesions and a cluster of regional lymph nodes) resected prior to starting chemotherapy. The median survival time for these 60 cats was 116 days. Of the 60 cats, 48 rapidly went into complete remission following the administration of l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone (complete remission rate 80%) and these cats had a median survival of 187 days. Three cats were censored from further analysis as their long-term survival data were uninterpretable because they died of causes unrelated to lymphosarcoma or were prematurely lost to follow-up. Twenty cats were classed as ?long-term survivors? based on survival time in excess of one year and at least 14 were ?cured? based on the absence of physical evidence of lymphosarcoma 2-years after initiating treatment. In other words, of the 48 cats that reached complete remission, in excess of 29% were ?cured?. Despite detailed analysis, few meaningful prognostic indicators based on patient or tumour characteristics were identified, although long-term survivors were more likely to be less than 4-years (P = 0.04) and to have tumours of the T-cell phenotype (P = 0.06). Excluding the one FeLV ELISA-positive cat with mediastinal LSA, 7 of 9 cats less than 4 years-of-age were long-term survivors (median survival time >1271 days). There was a strong association between achieving complete remission and long-term survival (P = 0.003). On the basis of 27 replies to a questionnaire, owners were generally very satisfied with the response to chemotherapy, irrespective of the survival time of the individual patient. Eighty five percent of owners expressed complete satisfaction with their decision to pursue chemotherapy and 70% believed their cat's health status improved during the first 2-weeks of treatment. Importantly, 78% of owners considered that chemotherapy required a very substantial time commitment on their part. Conclusions It was possible to cure approximately one quarter of cats with lymphosarcoma using sequential multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. FeLV-negative cats younger than 4 years (typically with mediastinal lymphosarcoma) had a particularly favourable prognosis. The decision to embark on chemotherapy should be based on the results of induction chemotherapy with l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone, as the response to this was a good predictor of long-term survival. Cats surviving the first 16 weeks of chemotherapy generally enjoyed robust remissions (in excess of 1 year) or were cured of their malignancy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. Data Sources Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: ?tissue oxygen monitoring,? ?near-infrared tissue spectroscopy,? and ?tissue oxygen saturation (StO2).? Human Data Synthesis Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. Veterinary Data Synthesis Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. Conclusion Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.
