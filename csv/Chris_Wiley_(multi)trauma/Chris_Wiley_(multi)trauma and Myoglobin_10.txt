AB  - Abstract In this editor's review, articles published in 2012 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration. As the official journal of the International Federation for Artificial Organs, the International Faculty for Artificial Organs, and the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide such meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected, and especially to those whose native tongue is not English. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our publisher, Wiley Periodicals, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to recording further advances in the coming years.

AB  - Abstract While electrospinning had seen intermittent use in the textile industry from the early twentieth century, it took the explosion of the field of tissue engineering, and its pursuit of biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, to create an electrospinning renaissance. Over the past decade, a growing number of researchers in the tissue engineering community have embraced electrospinning as a polymer processing technique that effectively and routinely produces non-woven structures of nanoscale fibers (sizes of 80 nm to 1.5 µm). These nanofibers are of physiological significance as they closely resemble the structure and size scale of the native ECM (fiber diameters of 50 to 500 nm). Attempts to replicate the many roles of native ECM have led to the electrospinning of a wide array of polymers, both synthetic (poly(glycolic acid), poly(lactic acid), polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, etc.) and natural (collagen, fibrinogen, elastin, etc.) in origin, for a multitude of different tissue applications. With various compositions, fiber dimensions and fiber orientations, the biological, chemical and mechanical properties of the electrospun materials can be tailored. In this review we highlight the role of electrospinning in the engineering of different tissues and applications (skin/wound healing, cartilage, bone, vascular tissue, urological tissues, nerve, and ligament), and discuss its potential role in future work.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Information is lacking regarding the influence of long distance exercise on the systemic concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnl) in horses. Objectives: To determine if the concentration of cTnl in horses competing in 80 and 160 km endurance races increases with exercise duration and if cTnl concentrations can be correlated with performance data. Methods: Blood samples for the measurement of cTnl and 3 min electrocardiogram recordings were obtained from horses prior to, during and after completion of 80 and 160 km endurance races at 3 ride sites during the 2004 and 2005 American Endurance Ride Conference competition seasons. Results: Full data sets were obtained from 100 of the 118 horses. Endurance exercise was associated with a significant increase in cTnl over baseline in both distance groups. Failure to finish competition (poor performance) was also associated with an increased cTnl concentration over baseline at the time of elimination when data from both distances were combined. Other than one horse that developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, no arrhythmias were noted on the 3 minute ECG recordings that were obtained after endurance exercise in either distance group. Conclusions: Systemic concentrations of cTnl increase in endurance horses competing in both 80 and 160 km distances. Although final cTnl concentrations were significantly increased over their baseline values in horses that failed to finish competition, the degree of increase was not greater than the increase over baseline seen in the horses that successfully completed competition. The clinical significance of increased cTnl in exercising horses could not be ascertained from the results of this study. Potential relevance: These data indicate that cardiac stress may occur in horses associated with endurance exercise. Future studies utilising echocardiograpy to assess cardiac function in horses with increased cTnl are warranted.
