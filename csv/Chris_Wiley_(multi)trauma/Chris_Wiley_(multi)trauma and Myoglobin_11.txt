AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents case studies describing controversies, consensus, and new targets of recurrent and metastatic colorectal cancer. One case study discusses the scenario of a 53-year-old man presented four years ago with abdominal pain and signs of large bowel obstruction. He was diagnosed with an obstructing colon cancer at the hepatic flexure. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is 23, and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows new mesenteric lymphadenopathy surrounding the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as well as new 1 cm nodules in each lung. Another case study recommends the use of combination chemotherapy and fluoropyrimidine with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer if patient performance status and comorbidities allow.

AB  - Abstract Almost every living thing requires iron (including aerobic, and facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria) because iron plays key roles in a broad range of physiologically essential molecular processes ranging from catalysis, oxygen transport, and oxidative phosphorylation to structuring proteins. The useful redox properties of iron enable its utility in these molecular functions, but its scarcity in the environment in bioavailable forms, coupled with the double-edged nature of its redox properties (which can lead to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species), require complicated acquisition, transport, and storage mechanisms, both by environmental microbes and by higher animals. These iron acquisition mechanisms come into direct conflict when microbes compete with each other for this scarce resource in the environment and when pathogenic bacteria infect animal hosts. A very simple and potently effective strategy employed by many animals to ward off bacterial and fungal infections, at least in the early stages while pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses are developing, is to further constrict the already tightly controlled endogenous iron budget, starving invading microbial pathogens of needed iron. The complicated system of endogenous iron transport permits these changes in response to infection. However, in a countering response, successful pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to evade this defense, the simplest and most dramatic of which is perhaps exemplified by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, which has evolved away from the need for any iron whatsoever. Bacteria and protists have also developed sophisticated and complicated mechanisms to access heme-associated iron directly. However, other strategies developed by microbes to compete with each other for iron in the environment, mediated by small-molecule iron chelators called siderophores, are, in turn, useful to access the otherwise restricted pool of iron in transit in the body, carried as complexes with specific iron-binding proteins. To counter siderophore-mediated iron pilfering, animals have developed a panel of siderophore-specific binding proteins (siderocalins) to steal the iron (and siderophore) back. To subvert this counterstrategy, successful pathogenic bacteria modify their siderophores into stealthy forms that cannot bind to host siderocalins. As with any arms race (e.g., the process of evolution), the cycle of response/counterresponse is likely to continue ad infinitum.

AB  - Adsorption of polymer molecules under flow conditions governs a broad range of desired or undesired phenomena and has a broad range of applications. Microfluidic platforms integrated with analytical instrumentation offer the capability to study polymer adsorption in flow in a time- and labour-efficient manner. Precise control of the microchannel dimensions and flow parameters enables accurate control of shear forces imposed on polymer solutions and on the molecules deposited on the surface, along with high sensitivity, enhanced reliability, and low reagent consumption. This review highlights recent advances in theoretical and experimental microfluidic studies of polymer immobilization under flow conditions in three area, namely, biosensing, biofouling, and studies of thrombosis and hemostasis.

AB  - The phenol functionality is involved in diverse biological processes and functions, serving as a proton donor and as a metal-binding ligand. It is commonly found in many biochemicals (such as siderophores and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan), pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics, metal-chelating agents, and diagnostic agents), and natural products (such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and salicylic acid). In association with other functional groups, the phenol moiety forms various types of metal-binding sites of diverse structures and functions, for example, for iron binding and transport, in enzymes for oxygenation of substrates, and for biotransformation of aromatic compounds. Many environmentally hazardous aromatic compounds such as bisphenol A, PCB, and DDT can be degraded by tyrosinate(phenolate)-containing metalloenzymes from microorganisms, which provides a clue for bioremediation of these toxic substances. Moreover, the phenol-containing wet-adhesive byssal proteins from some clams and mussels has stimulated further development of adhesive materials for medical and other applications; and the study of binding of transferrin with nanoparticles affords better understanding of protein?mineral interfacial interactions. In addition to these naturally occurring metal-phenolate centers, there are many metal complexes of phenol and derivatives that exhibit various catalytic activities and serve as structural and/or functional model systems for tyrosinate-containing metalloproteins.
