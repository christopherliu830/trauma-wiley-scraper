AB  - Summary Burns can be classified, on the basis of causes, into different groups, such as fire burns; scald burns; contact burns; chemical burns; electric burns; and radiation burns. Fire burns are the most common cause of burns in all age groups, except for children, for whom scalds are the most common. Locally, thermal energy causes coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and deeper tissues of the skin. Chemical and electrical burns, besides causing coagulative necrosis, may cause direct disruption of cell membranes. Three concentric zones of injury can be recognized in and around the burned skin: zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia. Burn depth is classified depending upon the depth of damage to the skin and this classification is important because this helps in selecting therapy and determining prognosis. Burn injuries are classified by the American Burn Association into three categories and this classification helps in treatment guidelines.

AB  - Abstract Although the aberrant assembly of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the molecular basis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) oligomerization remains undetermined. We investigated the roles of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an endogenous cross-linker in mSOD1-linked ALS. TG2 interacted preferentially with mSOD1 and promoted its oligomerization in transfected cells. Purified TG2 directly oligomerized recombinant mutant SOD1 and the apo-form of the wild-type SOD1 proteins in a calcium-dependent manner, indicating that misfolded SOD1 is a substrate of TG2. Moreover, the non-cell-autonomous effect of extracellular TG2 on the neuroinflammation was suggested, since the TG2-mediated soluble SOD1 oligomers induced tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1?, and nitric oxide in microglial BV2 cells. TG2 was up-regulated in the spinal cord of pre-symptomatic G93A SOD1 transgenic mice and in the hypoglossal nuclei of mice suffering nerve ligation. Furthermore, inhibition of spinal TG2 by cystamine significantly delayed the progression and reduced SOD1 oligomers and microglial activation. These results indicate a novel role of TG2 in SOD1 oligomer-mediated neuroinflammation, as well as in the involvement in the intracellular aggregation of misfolded SOD1 in ALS. A new role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in misfolded SOD1-linked neuroinflammation has been clarified. TG2 recognized and oligomerized only misfolded forms of SOD1, which robustly activated microglia, and induce the expression of proinflammatory molecules such as iNOS, IL-1?, and TNF-α. The inhibition of spinal cord TG2 of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice successfully suppressed neuroinflammation and delayed the progression.

AB  - Abstract The biliary system originates in the small biliary canaliculi and eventually drains into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater. Although a wide variety of liver diseases can involve the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, the four that most frequently occur in adult livers are the following: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic and large intrahepatic mechanical bile duct obstruction (BDO), and secondary (acquired) sclerosing cholangitis (SSC). These disorders each have characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and are discussed in detail in this chapter. Additionally autoimmune hepatitis that attacks bile ducts (autoimmune cholangitis) is also briefly mentioned in the section on differential diagnoses. Finally, the chapter compares PBC, PSC, and large duct obstruction and the various histologic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features aiding in the diagnosis.

Understanding the basic concepts of stone formation is vital in its prevention, which is key not only as a preventative measure but also to ensure patients do not form further stones. In this chapter, we discuss the pathophysiology of stone formation as well as the diagnostic and management modalities.

AB  - Abstract: Polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, are naturally present at high concentration in grape skin, seeds, and red wine. Resveratrol is present in cis and trans isoforms and the major trans isomer is the biologically active one. Epidemiologic studies have revealed a reduced incidence of cardiovascular risk associated with consumers of red wine; this has been popularized as the French paradox. Resveratrol has been shown to have significant antioxidant properties in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models. It can reduce ischemic damage in heart ischemia reperfusion injury and also in brain ischemia/reperfusion in rodent models. Due to the high rate of oxygen consumption in the brain, and especially low levels of antioxidant defense enzymes, this organ is particularly susceptible of free radical damage. Most of the protective biological actions associated with resveratrol have been associated with its intrinsic radical scavenger properties. We have investigated the possibility of other indirect pathways by which resveratrol can exert its neuroprotective abilities. We have specifically tested whether heme oxygenase neuroprotective enzyme could be stimulated after resveratrol treatment. Using primary neuronal cultures, resveratrol was able to significantly induce heme oxygenase 1, whereas vehicle control showed no effect. No detectable toxicity was quantified. It is well established that after stroke significant levels of intracellular heme levels increase. The source of free heme comes mainly from several heme-containing enzymes. Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is a pro-oxidant and its rapid degradation by heme oxygenase is believed to be protective. Moreover, the generation of heme metabolites can also have their own intrinsic cellular properties. All together, increased heme oxygenase activity by resveratrol is a unique pathway by which this compound can exert its neuroprotective actions.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.
