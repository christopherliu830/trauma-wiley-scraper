AB  - A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented with generalised skin rash. Gingival hyperplasia and hepatosplenomegaly were also noted. His laboratory data showed hemoglobin of 10.3?g/dL, white blood cell count of 203.6?K/uL and platelet count of 72?K/uL. Peripheral blood smears revealed that 67% of the white blood cells was monoblasts, 25% was promonocytes and atypical monocytes. Bone marrow aspirate smears showed that 97% of the nucleated cells were composed of monoblasts and promonocytes. Approximately 80% of the immature cells showed intense non-specific butyrate esterase activity. The morphologic and cytochemical findings were compatible with a diagnosis of acute monocytic leukaemia. Skin biopsy taken from the left medial thigh revealed a Grenz zone and a dense infiltrate of atypical cells throughout the dermis. The cells were positive for KP1 (CD68) immunohistochemical stain. The findings were consistent with cutaneous manifestation of leukaemia (leukaemia cutis). The patient?s condition deteriorated rapidly despite chemotherapy and expired 10 days after initial presentation. Leukaemia cutis is more common in acute monoblastic/monocytic leukaemia (AMoL) than in other subtypes of leukaemia. Leukaemia gingival hyperplasia is another characteristic feature of AMoL. Dissemination to the skin is generally associated with a poor prognosis.

AB  - Tattoo pigment in sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma patients is a clinical challenge. A 77-year-old man presented with a pink nodular lesion of the right upper arm. Biopsy revealed a 1.9?mm thick, Clark level 4 nodular melanoma. A wide local excision with 2?cm margins and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was planned. Pre operative lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-99?m demonstrated a single strongly pigmented SLN in the right axilla. A prominent tattoo was located on the patient?s upper arm in the area of the melanoma. The clinical impression was highly suspicious for metastatic disease and the tissue was sent to pathology for examination. Frozen section showed a lymph node with benign histiocytes. There were black non-polarizable coarse granules in the subcapsular, sinusoidal areas and also in the histiocytes. Review of permanent hematoxylin and eosin sections as well as immunohistochemical analysis with MART-1 and HMB-45 showed no evidence of metastatic melanoma in the SLN. Pigmentation of lymph nodes is not pathognomic of malignant melanoma. Black pigmented lymph nodes can occur by carbon deposits of tattoo pigment as in our case. Histological confirmation of metastatic malignant melanoma in the SLN is imperative before proceeding to complete regional lymph node dissection.

AB  - A 57-year-old woman presented with a three-week history of an erythematous nodule on her palm. The clinical diagnosis was pyogenic granuloma. Histology revealed a circumscribed dermal nodule of uniform, primitive round cells with numerous mitotic figures and apoptopic cells. The tumor cells showed strong membranous immunoreactivity for CD99 and nuclear immunoreactivity for Fli-1. The tumor cells were negative for S-100 protein, cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and actin. The diagnosis of Ewing?s sarcoma was made. CT scans showed no evidence of an osseous or deep soft tissue primary tumor or metastatic disease. The tumor was excised with 1?cm margins, and the patient received six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. One year after diagnosis, the patient is alive without evidence of disease. Extraosseous Ewing?s sarcoma (EES) rarely presents as a primary skin tumor and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors involving the skin. It is important to distinguish primary cutaneous EES from secondary involvement of the skin by ES, as primary cutaneous EES has a more indolent course compared to classic EES or osseous ES. Immunohistochemical stains for CD99 and Fli-1 are useful markers to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous ES.

AB  - A 74-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic, 20 by 10?cm, erythematous, indurated plaque on the sacrum with similar lesions in the folds of both legs. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated ANA and ESR but normal rheumatoid factor, TSH, Lyme, anti-DNA, and SSA/SSB antibodies. Biopsies from the sacrum and left leg showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of foamy histiocytes, epitheliod cells, and multinucleated giant cells, as well as lymphocytes and eosinophils in the entire dermis. The patient was diagnosed with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with plaques. The lesions resolved spontaneously. IGD with plaques is a rare but benign disorder of uncertain etiology. Its characteristic histopathology and clinical appearance distinguish it from other granulomatous dermatitis.

AB  - This patient was a 61-year-old white female who received several years of penicillamine therapy for the treatment of cystinuria. She subsequently developed penicillamine induced cutis laxa, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum like skin lesions. In addition, she suffered from numerous chronic bilateral lower extremity skin ulcerations. Her past medical history was also significant for end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis and pulmonary fibrosis. She presented to the University of Miami Wound Care Center in 1/04 for treatment of her chronic ulcerations. On physical examination, the patient had multiple large hyperpigmented plaques with central ulcerations on her lower extremities. Some of the ulcers had overlying crust and others were covered with yellow fibrinous tissue. She also had generalized thickened, lax skin with multiple folds. On her neck, thighs, back and arms were violaceous, atrophic, serpiginous plaques with peripheral crusted erosions. A biopsy taken from the patients left thigh revealed dermal elastosis and the features of pseudo-pseudoxanthoma. Two additional biopsies taken from the left thigh demonstrated elastosis perforans serpiginosa. This case highlights multiple skin manifestations of penicillamine therapy.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have undertaken a review of the Massachusetts General Hospital experience of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). Twelve cases were identified, and the dermatopathologic features of lesional skin biopsies were examined. We looked systematically at nine parameters and graded each on a scale of 0 (minimal or none) to 3 (highest or most): 1) extent of fibrocytic proliferation, 2) extent of collagen thickening, 3) extent of vascularity, 4) extent of pannicular involvement, 5) extent of elastolysis, 6) presence of mucin, 7) presence of calcification, 8) presence of giant cells, and 9) presence of inflammation. Results demonstrate that fibrocytic proliferation, collagen thickening, inflammation, and vascularity most commonly were classified as grade 1?2; mucin deposition and elastolysis varied from 0?2; pannicular involvement ranged from 1?3; nearly all had calcification grade of 0, and there were no giant cells detected in any of the twelve cases. Comparing our results to published reports suggests that there are some interesting observations. Our cases tended to be less fibrocellular, have less mucin, and have more vascularity than the initial 14 cases described by Cowper et?al (2001). The implications of the dermatopathologic findings for clinical course and prognosis are currently being evaluated.

AB  - Hyaline globules (HG) are frequently found in neoplastic cells of Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS). Presence of HG, characteristic of but not specific of KS, has been considered to represent erythrophagocytosis. In order to further characterize the nature of HG, we studied 10 cases of cutaneous KS with distinct HG using immunohistochemistry for hemoglobin A, Kappa and Lambda. All KS cases were of nodular type. Also included were 3 cases of glomeruloid hemangioma with similar HG in endothelial cells for the comparision. In selected cases electron microscopic examination was performed. PAS stain with diastase digestion was also done in all cases. Results: HG were diastase resistant and PAS positive. All HG in neoplastic cells of KS and endothelial cells of GH were negative for hemoglobin A. There was variable staining for light chains: focal but strong positivity for kappa, weak and variable staining for Lambda. Some HG was positive for both kappa and lambda. Electron microscopic study demonstrated HG as homogeneous electron dense inclusions with internal small vacuoles, whorled or granular materials. Conclusions: All HG in neoplastic cells and endothelial cells of GH represent phagolysosomes. Negative stain for hemoglobin A in KS and GH do not support the inclusions being fragmented RBC?s.

AB  - A 61-year-old female presented with blurry vision. Questioning revealed ?Flu-like? symptoms preceding the blurry vision by two weeks. An ophthalmologist diagnosed anterior granulomatous dermatitis, which improved with prednisolone drops. One month later, an ?itchy rash? and constitutional symptoms including fever, night sweats, and weight loss were reported. Physical examination revealed a viral-type maculopapular eruption over the trunk and proximal extremities. A few weeks later, repeat examination showed progression to a diffuse, reddish-brown, slightly edematous, papular eruption. Lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia, a polyclonal gammopathy, and an elevated ESR. Punch biopsies on two occasions showed a proliferation of mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytic cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. Emperipolesis was easily demonstrated. A background of plasma cells and small lymphocytes were noted. Stains for organisms were negative, and polarizable material was not present. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes marked with S-100 but were negative for CD1a. A diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai Dorfman was made. The cutaneous symptoms improved over six months without medical therapy. Cutaneous Rosai Dorfman disease with constitutional symptoms and laboratory evidence of systemic involvement but without lymphadenopathy has not been previously described. This unusual case suggests that a wider spectrum of disease presentation may exist.

AB  - An 11-year-old adopted male presented with deforming scalp and bilateral posterior auricular nodules, joint contractures, and gingival hypertrophy. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodules revealed a normal epidermis with areas of extracellular eosinophilic ground substance surrounding benign spindle-shaped (myo)fibroblasts in the dermis and subcutis, alternating with hyalinized, acellular zones. The spindle cells did not show cytologic atypia. A diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) was given. The patient had been seen multiple times in the past for similar recurring, disfiguring dermal and subcutaneous nodules. The patient had a history of osteolytic lesions of the distal radius and ulna and hyaline deposition involving the sigmoid colon and rectum. JHF is a rare autosomal recessive hyalinosis with mutations of the Capillary Morphogenesis Gene-2 (CMG-2) at chromosome 4q21, a region that encodes a binding protein that concatenates capillary collagen IV to laminin. Other genetic abnormalities include mutations in dermal collagen (types I and III). Disease onset occurs early in life. Organ involvement is an ominous sign usually resulting in death during infancy or early childhood. Surgery is the only presently available treatment.

AB  - Cellular blue nevus is composed of dendritic melanocytes, together with islands of epithelioid and plump spindle cells. We examined 58 cases of blue nevi. Fourteen cases were common blue nevi. The remaining 44 blue nevi were divided into three types according to its silhouettes. These were nodular (type 1, 18 cases), nodular with notch (type 2, 16 cases), and rounded pushing patterns (type 3, 10 cases). Well circumscribed top heavy nodule was observed in type 1, and it was limited to the dermis. Type 2 showed budding appearance into the subcutaneous tissue. Type 3 revealed bottom heavy with downward pushing margin. Both type 2 and type 3 were demonstrated biphasic patterns of epithelioid and spindle cells. Perineural distribution of melanocytes was also observed in type 2 and 3. The size of these types was 3.3?mm in type 1, 4.7?mm in type 2, and 7.4?mm in type 3. The thickness of these types was 1.6?mm in type 1, 2.5?mm in type 2, and 5.2?mm in type 3. Our results suggest that cellular blue nevi may be divided into three stages. Type 1 is its early stage, and may be misinterpreted as common blue nevi.

AB  - A 34-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-c) and idarubicin. Seven days later, while on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, she simultaneously developed fever coupled with painful, pruritic, and erythematous plaques on the face, neck, and chest along with marked edema and erythema of both palms and one sole. With negative blood cultures and a skin biopsy showing epithelial cell vacuolar degeneration and neutrophilic infiltrates surrounding eccrine gland coils, a diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) was rendered. Treatment with oral dapsone rapidly cleared the eruption. During her first consolidation with Ara-C and idarubicin four weeks later, a similar febrile cutaneous eruption occurred and again dapsone therapy led to resolution. For subsequent consolidation courses, pre-medication with dapsone was instituted and the patient remained eruption-free. NEH is a rare and often misdiagnosed disorder. Multiple chemotherapy medications have been implicated as etiologic agents including Ara-c, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, bleomycin, and mitoxantrone. Current oncologic induction-consolidation protocols carry the potential for recurrent NEH in predisposed patients. As this is only the second report of prophylactic dapsone therapy for NEH, further investigation into this topic is warranted.

AB  - Background: Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD), can be strikingly similar, if not indistinguishable, histologically from scleromyxedema. Both disorders consist of a dermal and subcutaneous proliferation of fibroblast-like cells with mucin production. NFD has been shown to contain an increased number of dual positive CD34 and procollagen cells, as well as an increased number of factor XIIIa positive cells. To our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison between the histologic and immunophenotypic properties of scleromyxedema and NFD. Design: Nine biopsies from eight cases of NFD and eight biopsies from eight cases of scleromyxedema were identified. Standard immunohistochemical techniques for antibodies toward CD34, procollagen I, CD31, SMA, and factor XIIIa were applied. A colloidal iron stain was used to evaluate for dermal mucin. Amount of antibody expression and mucin production were then evaluated using a grading scale of 0?3. Results: Both NFD and scleromyxedema were found to have similar immunophenotypic expression. Both demonstrated increased numbers of CD34 and procollagen-positive fibroblast-like cells, as well as increased numbers of factor XIIIa positive cells. Increased vessels and stromal mucin were identified in both diseases without significant differences. Conclusions: Although scleromyxedema and NFD are clinically distinct diseases, their? morphologic and immunophenotypic appearances are likely to be similar.

AB  - An 81 yo male presented with several asymptomatic firm 1?5?cm red purple plaques on the trunk and lower extremities associated with a mild pancytopenia. Histological examination revealed a diffuse, monotonous dermal infiltrate of atypical medium sized cells with fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated positivity for CD 45, CD43, CD4, Bcl-2, and TdT; but was negative for cytokeratin, melan-A, CD30 and hematopoietic lineage specific markers. A subsequent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a dense population of cells that were morphologically consistent with blasts. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed lesional cells that expressed CD56, CD4, CD7, CD5, HLA-DR and TdT. However, lineage specific markers for B-cells (CD19, CD20, cCD79a, and CD10), T-cells (sCD3 and cCD3), and myeloid cells (CD13, CD33, CD117, cCD13, CD14, CD41, CD61, myeloperoxidase, and alpha napthyl butyrate esterase) were not expressed. Molecular studies by PCR exhibited no evidence of T-cell receptor or heavy chain gene rearrangements. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a primary cutaneous blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphomas are characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous involvement and an aggressive clinical course. Our patient responded dramatically to one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy with resolution of his cutaneous tumors.

AB  - Although subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive form of lymphoma, some patients manifest a long waxing and waning phase unaccompanied by constitutional symptoms. Magro et?al (2004) applied the term ?atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis (ALLP)? to this distinctive form of lymphocytic panniculitis. Eight ALLP patients (five females and three males, mean age: 34.0?±?12.5) were encountered from Jun 1999 to Nov 2003 at GyeongSang National University Hospital in Korea. Five patients (62.5%) had skin lesions only and oral prednisone therapies were done. Two of five had no relapse but three showed a waxing and waning course till now. In three patients (37.5%) presenting cytopenias and fevers, chemotherapies were done with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicine, bleomycin and/or adriamycin. Two of three led to complete resolution till now and included only one patient with clonal T-cell receptor-gamma rearrangements. In seven patients, serum EBV antibody studies were performed. Six of them suggested EBV reactivation state and one was asymptomatic EBV carrier. In three patients, tissues EBV ISH were done and all were positive to EBER and lytic probe.

AB  - Cutaneous small blue cell tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms whose differential includes primary adnexal, neuroendocrine and lymphoproliferative tumors, as well as metastatic lesions. Another entity to be considered in the differential is Ewing?s sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). We present a 19-year-old female who developed a solitary, subcutaneous mass on her back. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated, cellular, nodular neoplasm of small, blue cells containing round to ovoid, vesicular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cam 5.2 and CD99. Overall, the lesion resembled an malignant spiradenoma (spiradenocarcinoma). CD99 reactivity prompted analysis with dual-color interphase FISH for translocations involving (22q12), which was positive, a sensitive marker for ES/PNET. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of ES/PNET should be considered in the differential of primary cutaneous blue cell tumors. These lesions are difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous small blue cell tumors due to their rarity and because the diagnosis is often not considered at this site.

AB  - We present the case of a 27 year-old female with a linear array of brown keratotic papules with a raised nodule within, located in the right mid upper inner thigh. A biopsy of the nodule showed a superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision of the entire lesion showed an epidermal nevus without residual carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas developing within an epidermal nevus constitute an unusual association, mostly occurring in long standing lesions of elderly patients. Other epithelial neoplasms described arising within epidermal nevi include basal cell carcinomas, malignant eccrine tumors and keratoacanthomas. Although our patient did not have an identifiable epidermal nevus syndrome, the presence of a squamous cell carcinoma within an epidermal nevus in a young person suggests increased susceptibility to tumor development. Moreover, chromosomal aberrations have been described in epidermal nevi, including chromosomal breakage and variegated translocation mosaicism. We suggest that the presence of an epidermal nevus should alert the clinician for the potential development of a malignant neoplasm within it, including squamous cell carcinoma, even in the absence of an identifiable hamartoma-neoplasm syndrome.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital for change in mental status. She had a splenectomy five years prior to admission. The white blood cell count was 154,000 cells/microliter with 95% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis and Candida krusei. She developed a wrist lesion at the site of a previous arterial line. The lesion had a striking resemblance to a bulls-eye, with three distinct concentric zones. A bedside touch preparation rapidly processed with Periodic Acid Schiff staining demonstrated a single intact aseptate broad hypha. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae throughout the dermis and subcutis invading both blood vessels and interstitum. A skin biopsy specimen sent for fungal culture grew Rhizopus arrhizus. Cutaneous zygomycosis is a rare, devastating disease that can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. This case illustrates a distinct morphology, which we have coined the ?bulls-eye infarct of cutaneous zygomycosis?. Recognition of this unique appearance allows a rapid bedside diagnosis of this life threatening infection. To our knowledge, this morphology has been reported only twice in the medical literature.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.
