AB  - The spectrum of melanocytic proliferations ranges from banal to overtly malignant. Borderline melanocytic lesions which bridge these two extremes pose a challenge, as their biological nature remains undefined. We set out to evaluate the utility of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in such lesions. Our compendium was defined by 11 cases of borderline melanocytic proliferations whereby sentinel node sampling was conducted. There were three severely atypical dermal-epidermal melanocytic proliferations manifesting borderline features with nevoid melanoma (calf, shoulder, knee), three arising in association with a deep penetrating nevus (chest, shoulder, and arm), three atypical Spitz?s tumors (helix, calf, arm, back), and two atypical pigment-synthesizing melanocytic tumors, resembling equine melanotic disease in one and cellular blue nevus in another (buttock, calf, arm). The patient population comprised seven males and five females ranging in age from age 9?36 (mean: 25 years). At least one positive sentinel lymph node was uncovered in seven of the cases with a positive sentinel lymph observed in all but one case of deep penetrating nevus and atypical Spitz?s tumor. The identification of sentinel lymph node positivity in seven of the twelve cases (58%) validates the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the setting of borderline melanocytic proliferations.

AB  - The histological findings in tinea corporis are variable, but include parakeratosis, often with neutrophils, spongiosis, and dermal inflammation. A recent study found some degree of papillary dermal edema in 17 to 23% of tinea cases. We report five cases of tinea corporis in which prominent papillary dermal edema (PDE) was the salient histological finding. Prominent PDE is often associated with diagnoses such as Sweet syndrome, polymorphous light eruption, allergic contact dermatitis and arthropod bite reactions. Interestingly, the submitted clinical diagnoses for our cases included Sweet syndrome (2), arthropod bite reaction (2), immunobullous disease (2), fixed drug eruption (1), eczema (1) and tinea (2). Our first case was a 25-year-old female with recurrent edematous plaques in fixed sites. Her lesions completely cleared with repeated courses of systemic steroids, but recurred after steroid taper. One fungal hypha was overlooked on her first biopsy and she was erroneously diagnosed with fixed drug eruption or a blistering disease (immunofluorescence negative). Six months later, repeat biopsy showed PDE, and numerous hyphae were seen on PAS stain. This prompted us to carefully examine PAS-stained sections on subsequent cases with prominent PDE. Prominent papillary dermal edema may be a clue to dermatophyte infection.

AB  - Epithelioid cell histiocytoma (ECH) is regarded as a variant of fibrous histiocytoma. It is not readily recognized as fibrous histiocytoma because of its unconventional histologic features and its resemblance to Spitz nevus. The ECH reported herein was from a 50-year-old man who presented with an asymptomatic, 1.5?cm, polypoid mass of unknown duration on his posterior shoulder. Histologic examination revealed epidermal collarette and dermal sheets of epithelioid cells with granular cytoplasm. Both fine and coarse granules were noted in the cytoplasm. They were PAS positive and diastase resistant. Many dilated vessels were also noted in the lesion. A panel of immunostains including S100, vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A was done. The lesional cells were reactive with vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A, and non-reactive with S100. These results favored exclusion of Spitz nevus and granular cell tumor, and supported the histologic impression of ECH. Both fine and coarse cytoplasmic granules were reactive with CD68. The latter finding supports that the cytoplasmic granules in this ECH represent lysosomes as in granular cell tumors.

AB  - A 27-year-old male soldier who was stationed in Iraq from 3/03 to 9/03 presented to a local dermatologist in 4/04 with several red slightly raised non-ulcerated nodules over the right wrist and ventral arm developed 2?3 months prior to the visit. The clinical impression was sporotrichosis. A punch biopsy was performed on a subcutaneous nodule and showed a granulomatous inflammatory process with scattered loosely organized clusters of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around dermal mucin, mainly involving the papillary and mid dermis. A diagnosis of granuloma annulare was suggested. Intralesional triamcinolone was used and the lesions initially improved but later recurred. However on deeper sections, there were scattered granulomas with a dominant necrotizing granuloma consisting of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around a central area of necrosis surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. In 5/04, he presented to the Birmingham VA Medical Center with similar lesions. A repeat biopsy again showed a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, numerous intracytoplasmic organisms with kinetoplasts were present within histiocytes. The findings were consistent with leishmaniasis due to L. major as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at Walter Reed Hospital. As more US soldiers return from the Middle East, previously rare cutaneous leishmaniasis will be seen more commonly.

AB  - Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic, various associated skin lesions have been recognized. One interesting phenomenon is chronic photosensitivity dermatitis. We report the case of a 44-year old homeless male with a 14-year history of HIV and a CD4 count of 350. He presented to us with a 5-month history of a pruritic photodistributed eruption. Physical examination revealed that he had erythematous, scaly, lichenified, and crusted plaques involving the face, neck, upper chest, and extensor extremities. Sparing of the areas under his watch and bracelet was found. A skin biopsy specimen showed psoriasiform dermatitis with an overlying thick, impetiginized, and hemorrhagic crust. There was prominent single cell necrosis throughout all epidermal layers. A lichenoid dermal infiltrate consisted mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. The patient?s presentation was consistent with a photosensitive psoriasiform interface dermatitis. The pathogenesis of this photodermatitis is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include the formation of a neoantigen due to UV exposure, depressed levels of endogenous scavengers leading to increased oxidative stress, and the onset of a pellagra-like dermatosis due to niacin-tryptophan deficiency. It is likely that several of these processes are acting in concert to cause this photoeruption.

AB  - A 40 year-old female with sero-negative arthritis presented with annular and cord-like configurations (rope sign) of asymptomatic papules and plaques along her flanks, suspected to be granuloma annulare. Medications at the time of presentation included methotrexate, prednisone, Vioxx (rofecoxib), Arava (leflunomide) and Remicade (infliximab). High-potency topical corticosteroids did not alleviate the eruption. Biopsy was performed demonstrating a deep dermal, interstitial and focally palisading granulomatous infiltrate with eosinophils. Dermal lymphangiectases were present, and the epidermis was unaffected. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination showed deep dermal, interstitial IgG, C3, and IgM deposits coating collagen bundles centered in the granulomatous infliltrate and IgG antinuclear keratinocyte reactivity. Serologic tested also revealed anti-nuclear antibodies. No other auto-antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with ?interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with cords and arthritis?. Thirteen cases of IGD with cords were identified in a literature review of which 7/12 (58%) were sero-(rheumatoid factor)-negative, 3/5 (60%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 12/13 (92%) had arthritis. One theory of pathogenesis is that immune-complex deposition in the dermis initiates a granulomatous reaction; DIF findings in this case support this proposed mechanism. IGD with cords is a singular clinicopathologic entity associated with sero-negative, non-erosive arthritis and antinuclear antibodies.

AB  - An 85-year-old woman developed a tumor on her left thigh, thought to be a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Microscopy revealed irregularly shaped, bulbous and deep aggregates of pale/clear cells emanating from the surface and reaching the lowermost dermis. This asymmetric mass of keratinocytes showed focal necrosis and dyskeratosis but no frank anaplasia, mitoses or infiltrative pattern. The interface with the dermis was blunt but irregularly undersurfaced. A more characteristic pale cell acanthoma (PCA) was colliding with it and consisted of a superficial, more regularly psoriasiform proliferation with thin suprapapillary plates and erosion but no necrosis. While it has been known that PCA can be unusual polypoid, large or atypical no author has proposed that some of the latter variants could represent a malignancy, more akin to verrucous carcinoma than to conventional SCC, due to the paucity of overt anaplastic features and the underestimation of pushing invasion and low cytologic atypia as defining traits of malignancy. One case of SCC in situ with PCA has been recently acknowledged but this is not what we are reporting: We propose that voluminous, misshapen, asymmetric or deep ?PCAs? may be low-grade carcinomas with pale cell differentiation and likely origin in a pre-existing PCA.

AB  - We describe a case of PCCS in a 73 year-old male who presented with a rapidly growing tumor of 6 months duration on the right ear. Clinical examination revealed a 5???4???4-cm ulcerated, crusted, exophytic tumor on the superior aspect of the helix. Histologically, the mass revealed a biphasic tumor with malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The epithelial component consisted of a few foci of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The majority of the tumor was composed of osteogenic sarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). An intricate transition of BCC into sarcoma was noted in a few foci. Atypical mitosis and necrosis were common. The BCC and tumor giant cells in the MFH area showed positive immunoreaction for cytokeratin and CD68 respectively. The tumor was negative for S-100 protein, HMB-45, muscle actins, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. In conclusion, a PCCS growing predominantly as osteosarcoma and MFH is reported. Although the exact histogenesis of PCCS is unknown, primitive mesenchymal cells of the dermis, surrounding the follicular units, are capable of pluripotent differentiation and are likely the source of origin of the sarcoma. The known aggressive biological behavior warrants wide excision and given the rare reports of metastasis and death, regular follow-up is required

AB  - Background: Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins. The role of cyclin D1 in the development, progression and prognosis of melanomas is controversial. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin. Methods: A total of 101 melanocytic lesions of the skin including compound nevi (21), intradermal nevi (18), melanoma in situ (3), primary invasive melanoma (30), and metastatic melanoma (29) were evaluated for cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The following tiered system was used for scoring: 0% of cells with nuclear staining (score 0), 1?19% nuclear staining (score 1), 20?49% nuclear staining (score 2), and 50% or greater nuclear staining (score 3). Results: The average score for primary melanomas was significantly higher compared to nevi (p?=?0.0046), and for in situ melanomas compared to primary invasive melanomas (p?=?0.011). There was slightly higher level of expression in compound nevi versus intradermal nevi. Conclusion: Our study indicates that cyclin D1 expression is increased in malignant compared to benign melanocytic lesions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the biological role of cyclin D1 in melanocytic lesions of the skin.

AB  - Introduction: To report an uncommon case of mycosis fungoides in a 62-year-old female. Case presentation: A 62-year-old Black female presented to our clinic with a wide spread of hyper-pigmented erythematous grayish plaques on trunk, extremities and face. There were no associated systemic illnesses and laboratory work was otherwise within normal range. Two skin biopsies were taken from the trunk and extremity. Both of the biopsies reveal similar features of coexisting like lichen planus and mycosis fungoides. There was interface dermatitis, vacuolar degeneration, prominent colloid body formation and lichenoid lymphonocytic inflammation through out the dermis. Epidermis was atrophic with overlying hyper and parakeratosis. There were many areas of epidermotrophism with collections of atypical lymphocytes. There was also marked pigmentory incontinence in the dermis. Comment: We present an uncommon case of mycosis fungoides with changes of lichen planus. It is important familiarise oneself with uncommon presentations of mycosis fungoides. It may be worthwhile to look for mycosis fungoides, while reviewing a classical case of lichen planus with clinical presentation of lichen planus.

AB  - Forty-four cases of biopsy-proven cutaneous metastases from internal organ or soft tissue malignancies were retrieved at a single institution from 1990 to 2004. All cases had detailed clinical and follow-up data. There were 19 males and 25 females, with a wide age range (37?86 years). Most (75%) had advanced (stage IV) disease at the time of metastasis. In four patients skin metastasis was the presenting lesion. The most common primary site for men is lung and for women, breast and lung. In nearly half of patients cutaneous metastasis was not the clinical diagnosis. The prognosis was grave (67% died of disease within a median of 7 months). Independent, blinded review by four dermatopathologists showed that without a detailed clinical history, most metastases from carcinomas were correctly suspected based on histologic patterns. However, metastases from small cell carcinomas and sarcomas were difficult to distinguish from primary skin tumors. Histologic recognition of a primary site was often difficult without pertinent clinical history. None of the metastasis had a combined immunohistochemical profile of B72.3 (?), CA125 (?), calretinin (+), p63 (+) and CK5/6 (+), which was commonly seen in skin adnexal tumors. This immunohistochemical panel appears to best differentiate the two entities.

AB  - Malignant mesothelioma presenting as a primary umbilical tumor is not reported in the English literature, to our knowledge. We present a 63-year-old woman with a painless and initially skin colored nodule in the umbilical area, which within one month became erythematous. The performed biopsy revealed an infiltrating glandular and ductal proliferation involving the dermis, subcutaneous fat and underlying skeletal muscle embedded in a loose and mucinous stroma. The tumor cells were of medium size with round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were conspicuous. The tumor cells showed a positive reaction for kermix, EMA, CK5/6, calretinin and CK7 and a negative reaction for CK20, CEA, Ber-Ep4, S100 protein, TTF-1, PRP, ERP, and Leu-7. Since calretinin is both a sensitive and specific marker of reactive and neoplastic mesothelial cells, a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid variant, was made. The performed exploratory laparotomy showed no evidence of malignancy and wide excision of the umbilical area showed no evidence of residual tumor. Follow-up examinations of the patient with repeated CT scans for the past two years were negative for recurrent or metastatic disease. We conclude that this malignancy likely developed in a setting of umbilical abnormalities associated with mesothelial remnants.

AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple café au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis limited to the skin. A total of ten cases, all women, in four families, and one sporadic case have been described in the English literature. The disorder usually begins in childhood and progresses slowly. We report two sporadic cases of adult-onset progressive mucinous histiocytosis in unrelated African American women, age 48 and 55?years old respectively, who developed red-brown and flesh-colored, asymptomatic papules on the face, arms and legs without truncal, mucosal or visceral involvement. The lesions show no spontaneous regression. Both patients lack associated systemic symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia or seizures. There is no underlying hyperlipidemia, paraproteinemia or lymphoproliferative disease. No family history of similar lesions can be identified. Light microscopy reveals dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes with abundant mucin deposition. Electron microscopy demonstrates a high number of myelin-figures or zebra bodies in the cytoplasm of histiocytes. On immunohistochemistry, positive staining with macrophage markers CD68, HAM56 and lysozyme, and Factor XIIIa, a transglutaminase present in dermal dendrocytes, and negative staining with Langerhans cell markers CD1a and S100, and CD34, a marker present in dermal dendritic cells derived from uncommitted mesenchymal cells, are observed.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - Mammary-like glands are a poorly recognized structure of the normal vulvar skin. Adenocarcinomas occur rarely in these glands and represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity that must be distinguished from metastatic tumors. We present a case of a 51-year-old patient with a long-standing nodule on her right labium majus. Excision with subsequent Mohs micrographic surgery revealed an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the mammary-like glands involving the dermis and subcutis. We review all cases thus far reported (including the case presented herein) and identify important clinical and morphologic features of this tumor. A significant histopathological and immunohistochemical overlap between this neoplasm, sweat gland carcinomas, and invasive extramammary Paget?s disease was recognized; suggesting the existence of a morphologic spectrum between these entities. Criteria for establishing the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of mammary-like glands are reviewed, including the importance of identifying transition zones between normal mammary-like glands and malignant glands. We believe that this tumor is best categorized as a locally aggressive neoplasm with a low metastatic potential and death from disease is uncommon. The successful treatment of this case by Mohs micrographic surgery suggests that an alternate management approach may be adopted for these tumors, particularly in elderly patients.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare, recently described fibrotic skin condition that primarily affects patients with a history of renal disease.We report 2 cases of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and review clinical and histopathologic features with differential diagnosis and more.Case #1 was a 64-year-old black male with chronic renal insufficiency which progressed to end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. After two days, he developed blisters on both his hands. By a month, his blister lesions resolved leaving scaly skin with some skin thickening and tightening in the hands and forearms. Over the course of one month, skin over above-mentioned areas began to harden and stiffen. His fingers began to coalesce and contract resulting in fixation of hand grip. He also developed flexing contracts at the elbows bilaterally. Skin biopsy revealed the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with giant cells reaction. Case #2 was a 44-year-old black male with a hx of nephropathy. He eventually developed end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. One month after, he was found to have thickened, sclerotic appearing skin involving the upper back, hands, and forearms with flexing contracts of the all the small joints. Histopathology was most consistent with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.

AB  - We describe here the case of a female patient with an otherwise classic invasive melanoma of the upper extremity, demonstrating the typical immunohistochemical profile, who presented three years later with massive ipsilateral axillary node metastases. The metastatic tumor had morphologic features similar to the primary melanoma, however at immunohistochemical level the tumor cells not only gained expression of pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) but also lost expression of all standard melanoma markers (S100, Melan-A, HMB-45, MIT-1, and tyrosinase) thus mimicking a poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma. Additional stains reveal expression of Vimentin, NSE, c-kit, CD10 and negativity for CK7, CK20, BR2, ER/PR, mucin, and LCA. To rule out a breast carcinoma, real-time RT-PCR was performed on a lymph node using six breast cancer-associated genes (>99% sensitivity), which was also negative. Clinical work-up of the patient failed to reveal abnormal masses in the breast or elsewhere. The clinical history, histological appearance, immunohistochemical profile (including negative CK7 and positive NSE, c-kit and CD10) as well as a negative RT-PCR renders almost null the possibility of a breast carcinoma and supports a diagnostic of melanoma in this case. Cases like ours may be easily misclassified unless a concerted approach is used to reach the correct diagnosis.

AB  - We present a 58-year-old Caucasian man who spawns sebaceous neoplasms with a widely varying histopathologic pattern, the true nature of which were difficult to determine in some of the cases. In a 10-year period, the patient developed over 20 lesions that varied in size, shape, and location. The patient denied a family history of either similar cutaneous lesions or internal malignancies that would fulfill the criteria of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). Vigilant screening failed to reveal visceral carcinomas. The histopathologic findings of the neoplasms as well as the results of tests for microsatellite instability(MSI) in various tumors and the immunohistochemical staining for the mismatch repair genes (MMR) MSH2 and MLH1 will be discussed. Our patient has been maintained on low-dose isotretinoin since 1995.

AB  - A 53 year old woman with CML in the chronic phase received therapy with Imatinib on two separate occasions. Both occasions were followed by the development of an abrupt onset of skin lesions characterized by painful and tender erythematous plaques and nodules on the upper extremities that subsequently resolved with hyperpigmentation. The patient was also found to have pleural and pericardial effusions. She had a WBC count of 57,250 cells per mm3, a platelet count of 740,000 per mm3 and a single temperature spike of 100.4 °F. Over the course of a week the WBC count dropped to 51,520 cells per mm3 but the percent of mature neutrophils rose to 55%. Imatinib was discontinued and steroid therapy led to resolution of the skin lesions with residual pigmentation. A skin biopsy was obtained that showed neutrophilic dermatosis with epidermal sparing consistent with Sweet's syndrome but with atypical features such as extension into deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. Lab work up including blood cultures and bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures of the skin as well as special stains of the skin biopsy specimen failed to reveal any microbiological etiology.
