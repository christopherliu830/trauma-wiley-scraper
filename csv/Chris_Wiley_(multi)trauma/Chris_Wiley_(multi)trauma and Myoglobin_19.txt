AB  - Fibrous papule (FP), synonymous with angiofibroma, is a common lesion that is often biopsied to exclude carcinoma. Clinically, FPs are small, dome-shaped, solitary, flesh colored papules arising on the nose and face of adults. Histologically, FPs are characterized by a dome-shape, fibrotic collagenized stroma, sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and variably increased and dilated vascular spaces. The vast majority of FPs are readily diagnosable based on these clinical and histologic criteria. Rare histopathologic variants have been reported. Recognition of these variants may avoid misdiagnosis of this common benign lesion. We illustrate four rare variants of FP that can cause diagnostic uncertainty including: hypercellular, clear cell, pigmented, and pleomorphic variants. Cellular FP has a dense infiltrate of round fibroblasts that have a nevoid appearance. Clear cell FP has a proliferation of round clear cells, some with slightly foamy cytoplasm, resembling histiocytes or clear epithelial cells. Pleomorphic FP demonstrates bizarre, stellate fibroblasts like those seen in pleomorphic fibroma. Pigmented FP has prominent melanocytic hyperplasia and dermal melanophages that can be confused with a melanocytic lesion. It is important to recognize these unusual variants of FP in order to accurately diagnose this common benign lesion and avoid over treatment or rebiopsy.

AB  - Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis is characterized by recurrent crops of tender edematous nodules on the lower legs. lobular panniculitis with granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, focal necrosis and septal fibrosis is present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been detected in some lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cases of erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis were found. H & E stained slides were reviewed. PCR assays for M tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was carried out. PCR did not reveal mycobacterial DNA, with positive controls indicating the reliability of the assays. Among the MOTT, cutaneous infections are most commonly caused by M. marinum. Subcutaneous tuberculoid granulomas may be seen with M. kansaii, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. avium complex. M. gordonae and M. malmoense rarely cause cutaneous infections. M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gastri and M. asiaticum are probably not cutaneous pathogens. MOTT DNA was not found? in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis. Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis has diverse etiologies with varying pathogeneses leading to similar histologic changes. The cases analyzed may have not have had an infectious etiology. However, in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis, performance of? PCR for MOTT as well as Mycobacteria tuberculosis complex may still be beneficial, particularly in cases from immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder characterised by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. Skin lesions show distinctive thickened, fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. PXE-like fibers have not been described in patients without PXE. We describe 12 patients without known PXE who demonstrated the incidental finding of small numbers of PXE-like fibers in association with the following conditions: lipodermatosclerosis, granulomatous dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, morphea profunda, erythema nodosum, septal panniculitis, basal cell carcinoma and fibrosing dermatitis NOS. The biopsies were almost exclusively from the lower extremities of elderly women (mean age 73.8). The affected gene in PXE has been recently described as ABCC6 which codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. The c.3421C>T mutation has been associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease. We describe a novel assay for this genotype employing real-time PCR of paraffin embedded skin biopsies. Four patients with PXE-like fibers were tested in this fashion and did not carry this mutation. Our series demonstrates that light microscopic findings associated with PXE are not specific, as PXE-like fibers can be observed in patients without clinical or genetic evidence of the disease.

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Diagnostic concordance of intraepithelial malignancy is generally only fair. Because the diagnosis of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma is not uniform and because such terms are not consonant with the nomenclature of other human epithelial malignancies, nomenclature revisions have been attempted. One hundred dermatopathologists were solicited to review 15 tissue sections representing a spectrum of varying thickness epidermal malignancy and to choose either actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma as the diagnosis. Among the 77 participating dermatopathologists intraclass correlation was high for what was perceived as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and their differentiation. Development of a two-tiered diagnostic system that retains our present diagnostic capabilities, but better fits the pathobiology of superficial epidermal malignancy is suggested.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are proteins that may play importants roles in survival, proliferation and progression to metastasis in several tumors, including melanoma. There is little information on the expression pattern of the phosphorylated (i.e. activated) forms of such kinases in melanoma and their impact on overall survival (OS). We sought to determine the expression, by immunohistochemistry, of phosphorylated MAP kinase (pMAPK), Akt (pAkt) and C-kit (pCkit) in primary and metastatic melanoma, and their correlation with OS. Fifteen patients with Stage III and Stage IV (metastatic melanoma) disease were randomly selected from the UT MD Anderson database. Expression was rated by two investigators on intensity (negative, weak, moderate, and strong) and proportion of reactive tumor cells (0?=?<5%, 1?=?5?25%, 2?=?>25?75%, 3?=?>75%). Eleven of the 15 tumors (primary and/or metatasis) exhibited pMAPK expression (73%). Corresponding percentages were 100% for pAKT and <50%(7/15) for pCkit. OS ranged from less than one year to 9 years. However, there was no correlation between OS and expression of any of these markers.

AB  - A 57-year-old Hispanic man with a personal and family history of bullae and photosensitivity, presented with a fungating, ulcerated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) on his left hand. Physical exam showed conjunctival injection, urethral stricture, symblepharon, loss of teeth, short stature, nail dystrophy and extensive poikiloderma. Excision and lymph node dissection showed moderate to poorly differentiated deeply invasive SCC, necessitating an amputation. Two of three axillary lymph nodes were positive. A random biopsy of the trunk showed epidermal atrophy, telangiectasia and pigment laden macrophages consistent with poikiloderma. Electron microscopy (EM) illustrated extensive reduplication of the basement membrane with loops, curls and free extensions of the basal lamina in the superficial dermis, reduced numbers of hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils, and a basement membrane focally devoid of basal cells. On the basis of the clinical features and the characteristic basement zone changes, a diagnosis of Kindler Syndrome (KS) was rendered. KS is a rare autosomal recessive photosensitivity disorder which contains features of both congenital poikiloderma and dystrophic epidermolytic bullosa, and has unique EM features. Despite the photosensitivity, few cases of malignancy in KS have been reported.

AB  - A 32-year-old African American male presented with a five year history of multiple verrucous plaques in a Blaschkoid arrangement on the left leg. Biopsies demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. The patient?s medical history did not reveal any heritable or exposure related risk factors. The patient was treated with radiotherapy. Four years later, he presented with a subcutaneous nodule within a prior site of radiation. MRI showed a 2.0???1.2?cm enhancing nodule in the subcutis. On biopsy, an ill-defined spindle cell proliferation was present in the dermis and subcutis. Marked nuclear pleomorphism and numerous multinucleated cells embedded in a myxoid stroma were noted. Spindle cells stained for CD68. Cytokeratin and S-100 were negative. A diagnosis of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma was rendered. Surgical excision was undertaken. A dominant lesion of MFH was identified, as well as multiple, clinically undetectable foci of early sarcoma. This is an unusual case of multifocal post-radiation sarcoma in an African American patient with squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. While sarcoma is a known risk factor following radiotherapy, the course of this patient would suggest caution in applying radiation in similar clinical settings, as well as long-term clinical follow-up for early detection and treatment of post-radiation sarcoma.

AB  - A 65 year-old, well-appearing and asymptomatic man presented with a small non-healing ulcer on the right palm present for 6 weeks. He reported a 15 year history of hand and foot ?eczema? treated with topical steroids. Six months earlier his right 4th toe had been amputated for ?infection?, but additional information was not immediately forthcoming. Punch biopsy from the palm demonstrated superficial ulceration, dermal eosinophils and possible cytoplasmic inclusions within keratinocytes, leading to suspicion of parapox infection. Over the ensuing two months his condition deteriorated markedly, and he developed multiple fungated and ulcerated cutaneous nodules. Incisional biopsy of the nodule on the right palm revealed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, and a perivascular infiltrate of medium to large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei and mitoses. These atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, but were negative for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, TIA-1 and EBER in-situ hybridization. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement revealed a clonal population. Retrospective analysis of the amputated toe demonstrated similar features. He declined conventional treatment, and has been reluctant to pursue follow-up. Our case highlights the fulminant course and dense mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with eosinophils often present in peripheral T-cell lymphoma that may complicate diagnosis.

AB  - Partial regression of primary cutaneous malignant melanoma is not uncommon, and may predict a higher likelihood of metastasis and decreased survival. Complete histologic regression of a primary cutaneous melanoma is a rarer occurrence of uncertain significance, with only 30 cases reported in the literature. Herein, we detail five additional cases of complete histologic regression of a primary cutaneous melanoma, which were discovered upon presentation with metastatic disease. A pigmented lesion, or its remnant, coupled with historical information was strongly suggestive of cutaneous malignant melanoma. However, histologic examination of the lesions in toto using multiple levels, and in some cases immunohistochemical stains, failed to reveal residual melanoma. Our cases are typified by the presence of metastasis of malignant melanoma to regional lymph nodes, with the absence other suspicious lesions or other malignancies. Through these instructive cases, the concept of completely regressed primary cutaneous melanoma is reviewed and the literature critically appraised. When considering a diagnosis of completely regressed primary cutaneous melanoma, it is important that the cases be well-documented and biopsy-proven. All patients with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with an occult primary lesion require a thorough and complete skin examination and consideration of completely regressed cutaneous melanoma within the differential.

AB  - Transverse sectioning of scalp biopsies was first proposed by Headington in 1984. Horizontal sections allow easy analysis of follicular density, accurate determination of hair shaft diameter, and quantification of the anagen:telogen ratio. The terminal to vellus hair (T:V) ratio is an important parameter in the differential diagnosis of non-scarring alopecias. A vellus hair is defined as having a cross-sectional diameter of 0.03?mm or less, and a diameter not exceeding the thickness of its root sheath. It is tedious to tally the T:V ratio in a standard 4?mm punch biopsy because the entire biopsy can only be visualised using the 2x and 4x objectives. It is difficult to identify vellus hairs with this magnification, and one must switch between high and low power, often losing track of which hairs have already been counted. All hair shafts are strongly acid-fast and stain bright red, making it easy to count terminal and vellus hairs with 2x and 4x magnification. We show acid-fast (Ziehl-Zeelsen) stained slides from various types of non-scarring alopecias cut at the level of the infundibula, and contrast these to hematoxylin and eosin stained slides at the same level, to demonstrate how acid-fast staining greatly facilitates follicular counting.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arises from a series of genetic changes that form a clone of keratinocytes with enhanced growth characteristics. The p44/42 Map kinase pathway is a highly conserved growth regulatory pathway that helps relay critical signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Evidence demonstrating activation of the p44/42 pathway in the human cutaneous SCC has not been established. This study examined if p44/42 MAP kinase is activated in lesions of keratinocytic neoplasia. Lesions from the defined stages of keratinocytic neoplasia, normal skin, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and squamous cell carcinoma, were randomly selected from archived material and studied. Antibodies that detect human p44/42 (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) and only phosphorylated, activated, human p44/42 were used. The intensity and prevalence of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was evaluated in the lesional cells. The results suggest that there is a not a simple linear relationship between the amount of nuclear staining and the type of lesion. The results show that there was a significant increase in the level of nuclear phosphorylated p44/42 staining progressing from an actinic keratoses to a sqaumous cell carcinoma in situ. These findings suggest that p44/42 MAP kinases are activated in keratinocytic neoplasia.

AB  - A 49-year-old Japanese male first visited our clinic at May 13th, 2003. A bean-sized black macule had been noticed in the parietal region since childhood. The lesion had increased in size gradually and had become 30?mm in diameter. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant melanoma clinically and also dermoscopically. Sentinel node navigation using radioisotope revealed the metastases. We performed wide local excision and radical neck dissection, and the definite diagnosis of malignant melanoma and regional nodal metastases was made. TNM staging was stage?b, that is, pT4b, N2c, M0. The patient also had nine small black freckles on the trunk and extremities. All of them were excised, and eight lesions of them were diagnosed as malignant melanoma, because proliferation of atypical melanocytes and formation of abundant abnormal nests in epidermis were observed histopathologically. Chemotherapy was performed, but metastases of skin and visceral region were found in February, 2004. These lesions had put up strong resistance to chemotherapy and the patient died on June, 6th, 2004. Autopsy revealed multiple metastases including heart, kidneys, liver and large intestine and so on. No other family members suffered from malignant melanoma. The origin of this patient?s melanoma remained unclear.

AB  - Background: Nodular Hidradenoma (NH) is an uncommon neoplasm with controversial cell origin (myoepithelial, eccrine and more recently apocrine), and few cytogenetic and DNA flow Cytometry data. Material and Methods: We report a case of NH on the left ankle of a 77 year-old man. The tumor was located subcutaneously and measured 2.5???2.0?cm, with no throbbing, tenderness, edema, or groin lymphadenopathy. A wide local excision was performed. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA), S-100 protein, p63 and Calponin were examined. A fresh central portion of the tumor was examined for karyotyping and DNA flow cytometry. Six months later the patient was healthy without local recurrence. Results: The tumor was positive for SMA, Calponin and p63 with focal staining for S-100. The karyotype showed four aberrant, unrelated clones, t(1;8)(p22;p23), del(11)(q14q23), t(1;10)(p13;q22) and del (6)(q23q26). DNA flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis showed that the tumor is 100% diploid with 6.55% S-phase. Conclusions: Expression of SMA, p63, Calponin, and S-100, which are myoepithelial markers, support a myoepithelial origin of this tumor. The multiclonal pattern observed in this neoplasm seems to reflect cytogenetic divergence during neoplastic progression. DNA diploidy with a low S-phase predicts a benign clinical course.

AB  - Severe keratinocyte dysplasia (SKD) has been reported in the early post-transplant period of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCST) patients, with a frequency as high as 47.4%. In the period less than 3 weeks post-transplant it was associated with cyclophosphamide conditioning. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of SKD in a later post-transplant period, from 28 days to 84 days, and study the possible causes. The 2003 slide file (227 slides) of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance was examined for skin biopsies from patients who had undergone HCST. Twenty-two cases (9.7%) showed SKD. A control group of 22 biopsies matched for days post-transplant and age were selected from the remaining 205 biopsies. SKD was associated with a busulfan conditioning regimen, 72.7% in the SKD group and 36.3% in the control group (p?=?0.016). SKD was not associated with cyclophosphamide (p?=?0.174), fludarabin (p?=?0.263) or total body irradiation (p?=?0.50). Although active GVHD (grade 2 or 3) was more commonly seen in SKD group (45.5%) than the control group (22.2%), it did not show significant difference (p?=?0.052). Our study showed that SKD developed in 9.7% of the skin biopsies from days 28 to 84 post-transplant, and was associated with busulfan conditioning regimen.

AB  - Congenital erosive and vesicular dermatitis healing with reticulated scarring is a rare entity presenting in the early childhood. It is manifest as crusted erosions and vesicles that heal relatively rapidly forming unique reticulated scars. Cohen first reported this entity in 1985 and since then, only ten patients have been reported. We herein report an additional case of this extremely unusual disorder. A 23 month-old girl who was noted to have ?rashes? and sores over her body at birth. Her twin sister was unaffected. She was born preterm at 35 weeks gestation but her developmental milestones have been within normal range. On exam she had depressed and somewhat macerated erosions and erythema primarily on her trunk, axillae, and ears. No vesicles or bullae were present. The skin biopsy showed neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates with abundant crusting. Cultures were negative for infectious agents and direct immunofluorescent studies were also negative. Over the next two years she periodically developed erosions which healed quickly. However, the depressed reticulated scars have persisted and are more sensitive to sun exposure. This scarring disorder may be associated with mild ongoing blistering and must be distinguished from other congenital blistering disorders and immunobullous diseases. The pathophysiology remains unclear.

AB  - A 67-year-old Chinese man presented with a longstanding history of asymptomatic, brown-red macules that diffusely involved his trunk and the extremities and was associated with generalized lymphadenopathy. His serum protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. No monoclonal Bence Jones protein was detected in the urine. Flow cytometry of his peripheral blood revealed a normal polyclonal population of B and T cells. Histopathologic examination demonstrated a dense nodular infiltrate of lymphocytes and numerous mature plasma cells in the reticular dermis. Immunoperoxidase studies for kappa and lambda light chains failed to demonstrate clonality. In addition, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies failed to reveal a monoclonal band. A bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormality. Cutaneous and systemic plasmacytosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous infiltrates in which plasma cells predominate.
