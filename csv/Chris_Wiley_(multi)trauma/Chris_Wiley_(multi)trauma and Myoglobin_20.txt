AB  - A 52-year-old male with Crohn?s disease presented with florid pustulosis of the face and trunk. Six months prior to presentation, he received amphotericin for pulmonary aspergillosis. Amphotericin was discontinued after five months due to toxicity, and pharmacotherapy was changed to voriconazole. After four weeks of voriconazole, the acneiform eruption occurred which prompted referral to dermatology. Physical examination revealed innumerable 0.5?cm?1.5?cm pustules, cysts, and inflammatory papules concentrated predominantly over the central face, ears, and conjunctiva, but also involving the chest, shoulders, and back. The clinical differential diagnosis included suppurative folliculitis, papulonecrotic tuberculid, cutaneous Crohn?s disease, acne fulminans, and pustular drug eruption. Multiple biopsies demonstrated diffuse neutrophilic and granulomatous dermal inflammation in a predominantly follicular and perifollicular distribution. Microorganisms were not identified by either histology or culture. The histologic differential diagnosis included cutaneous Crohn?s disease and pustular drug eruption. Voriconazole was discontinued with gradual clearing of the skin lesions. Three months later, worsening of the pulmonary disease necessitated restarting voriconazole. A recurrent pustular eruption, similar to the original eruption, occurred within weeks and subsequently cleared upon discontinuation of voriconazole. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of a voriconazole induced pustular drug eruption.

AB  - Acetylglucosoaminyltransferase V (GNTV), an enzyme responsible for branching of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Beta1?6 branched oligosaccharides, detected with the lectin, LPHA, are associated with tumor progression in human breast and colon cancer. They were found to be common to 22 types of human cancers, and were particularly expressed in metastases. Matriptase is a proteolytic inducer of both the HGF/cmet and plasminogen activator pathways, highly associated with metastasis. A potential prometastatic effect of GNTV was found to be due to modification of active matriptase by adding beta1?6 GlcNAc branching. We investigated expression of LPHA, matriptase and GNTV in pathology specimens of primary invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas. Sequential sections were stained with anti-GnT-V, anti-matriptase, or biotinylated LPHA. Our results showed variable staining patterns, from involving only small regions, to encompassing the entire tumor. The expression of all three markers was closely associated, suggesting that metastatic pathways might have been activated in the staining areas of these tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of matriptase expression in malignant melanoma, as well as the first demonstration of an association between matriptase, GNTV and beta 1,6-branched oligosaccharides in vivo.

AB  - A 41 year-old man presented with an atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque on the right lower abdomen present since?birth?. He denied any prior activity at the site, and had been told it was a ?scar? from a prenatal insult. Six months earlier, he developed idiopathic focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis and was placed on 70?mg prednisone per day. He had not demonstrated evidence of lupus eythematosus. Shortly after beginning this regimen, erythematous and tender papules developed around the quiescent plaque. He had tapered his prednisone dose to 60?mg per day, but additional papules continued to erupt. An ellipse biopsy was performed which included a portion of the atrophic plaque and several surrounding papules. Histological examination revealed a proliferation of fibrohistiocytes between and amongst collagen bundles. In some areas, fibrohistiocytes entrapped collagen in a fashion reminiscent of a dermatofibroma. In other areas, particularly that of the atrophic plaque, the fibrohistiocytes were less numerous and more delicate in appearance. Scattered rudimentary fascicles were demonstrated. Adnexal structures were preserved. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the fibrohistiocytes to be positive for factor XIIIa and actin, but negative for desmin, CD34, S-100, procollagen I, and CD68. This lesion demonstrated unique clinical/histiological aspects not well characterized in the literature.

AB  - Lipedematous alopecia is a rare entity of uncertain etiology characterized by a diffusely thickened and boggy scalp, with varying degrees of alopecia. Six of eight cases in the literature have occurred in African American women. Classic histopathologic findings include increased subcutaneous tissue, varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis, and an absence of significant mucin deposition. Herein, we report an additional case of lipedematous alopecia occurring in an African American woman who also demonstrated clinical, historical, and histopathologic findings reminiscent of discoid lupus erythematosus. Explicit observation of such an occurrence has not been made previously, although hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, mild perivascular or periadnexal infiltrates, and fibrosing alopecia have been reported in lipedematous scalp, possibly the residua of other cases with associated discoid lupus-like features. For further comparison, we contrast our case with a second patient with lipedematous scalp, which maintained histological similarities to lipedematous alopecia, but was lacked any significant hair loss. It is possible that some cases lipedematous alopecia may represent an unusual sequela of discoid lupus erythematosus. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of two diseases occurring independently, nor that early changes of lipedematous alopecia might share histopathological and/or clinical findings with discoid lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have reviewed sixteen patients with the diagnosis of desmoplastic Spitz nevus. The age of our patients ranged between seven years and fifty-four years. We noted a predominance of twelve female patients and four male patients. Histologically, ten of the sixteen cases were well circumscribed and symmetric. In six cases we were unable to ascertain the overall architectural features because of the biopsy technique. Only three cases showed significant junctional melanocytic nesting. In five cases there were rare nests of melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction and in eight cases there was no evidence of melanocytic nesting at the dermo-epidermal junction. Dermal mitotic figures were rare, with five cases showing a single dermal mitotic figure. The lesions did not arise in sun damaged skin as evidenced by the rarity of actinic elastosis within our specimens. Additional clinical and histologic findings and follow up will be reported.

AB  - Cutaneous adnexal tumors manifesting divergent differentiation are a rare but recognized subset of adnexal neoplasms. We present a 42-year-old woman with a cystic tumor of the skin above the left eyebrow. A biopsy revealed a tumor comprising eccrine tubules lined by a single row of columnar epithelium surrounded by a peripheral small cuboidal layer and containing, adhered to the internal cuticle, mucin-like material. In some areas, the eccrine tubules were associated with sheets of small plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells embedded in a chondroid matrix. Elsewhere, there were cysts containing central keratinous debris associated with a peripheral basaloid epithelial proliferation showing the formation of buds mimicking abortive hair follicle structures. No polarizable terminal or vellus hairs were seen. These two elements were geographically separate in the biopsy but collided in the center of the tissue element. A diagnosis of benign cutaneous mixed tumor with combined folliculosebaceous and eccrine differentiation was rendered. Such tumors present a diagnostic challenge and are frequently confused with neoplasms including the benign mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) and a variety of eccrine and folliculosebaceous neoplasms and harmatomata. This case illustrates the potential multilineage differentiation of pluripoential germinative cells of the cutaneous adnexae.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a small round cell tumor which does not characteristically stain with S-100 protein. We report a case of an 83 year-old male with a two-month history of an ulcerated nodule on the right arm. Histopathology revealed small blue round cells arrayed in a trabecular pattern and in diffuse sheets, with scattered mitoses and necrosis. The cells were negative for vimentin, positive for NSE, focally positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins and diffusely positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins, including CK20. The findings were diagnostic of MCC, however, foci of S-100 protein positive cells were also present in the tumor. Upon reviewing cases from Skin Pathology Laboratory at BUSM received between 1/1/2000 to 7/30/2004, we documented a total of 34 cases diagnosed as MCC; 24 were stained with S-100 protein and this case was the only one that stained positively. S-100 protein positivity of MCC, while having been previously reported, is an uncommon finding. We report our case to stress the importance of morphological and immunoperioxidase features for the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, particularly in the exceptional cases which exhibit S-100 protein positivity.

AB  - A five-month old girl presented with a 5?cm brown patch on her right lower leg. The lesion had a 6?mm area of hyperpigmentation that was removed by shave biopsy for pathologic diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis at the time was that of congenital nevus but the multicolored appearance of the lesion raised the index of suspicion for melanoma. Histology revealed junctional activity with melanocytes distributed in the dermis including migration around appendages and among collagen bundles as seen in congenital nevi. However, there were some unusual features that warranted careful analysis. The lesion was asymmetric, with numerous single melanocytes in confluence at the dermo-epidermal interface. Single cells and nests were noted in the epidermis. Our case illustrates a congenital nevus with atypical patterns easily confused with those of melanoma. Our lesion exhibited pagetoid melanocytes, which is considered virtually diagnostic of melanoma. However, these melanocytes were monomorphous as opposed to the pleomorphic appearance found in melanoma. Additionally, there was evidence of cellular maturation in the dermis as well as a lack of variance in nest size, which favors the diagnosis of congenital nevus1.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - The histopathologic differential diagnosis of subepidermal blisters is broad and most commonly includes primary dermatologic diseases (i.e. bullous pemphigoid), secondary blistering conditions (i.e. bullous lichen planus), and drug reactions (i.e. toxic epidermal necrolysis); however, when examining blister specimens taken during autopsy, several other entities need to be added to the differential diagnosis. For one year, we biopsied cutaneous blisters and erosions found during autopsies performed at the Dallas County Medical Examiner?s Office and examined them histologically. The objective of this study was to determine the primary cause of blisters and erosions seen at autopsy, characterize them histologically in order to allow differentiation from other blistering conditions, and emphasize causes of subepidermal blisters that are often not considered in the differential diagnosis. We present eight representative cases in order to illustrate the following points. The majority of blisters and erosions examined were subepidermal and secondary to physical causes, such as burns, defibrillation, submersion, fetal maceration, and decomposition. Although primary skin conditions need to be considered when examining blisters and erosions at autopsy, the most common entities are secondary to physical causes, and these need to be included in the differential diagnosis in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

We report a chondroma occurred on the tongue of a 38-year-old-woman. She presented with an asymptomatic, several-millimeter, firm papule on the lateral border of the tongue. She had been healthy otherwise, and the lesion had been present for about 9 to 10 months without change in size. Possibility of sialolith was considered clinically. Microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, lobular, subepithelial lesion composed of mature hyaline cartilage. No cytologic atypia of chondrocytes was noted. The overlying squamous mucosa was unremarkable. Chondromas may occur in association with Maffucci?s syndrome, Ollier?s disease, CREST syndrome, and Carney?s triad. However, in most cases, such as in this case, it is solitary and not associated with the preceding entities.

AB  - Rosai-Dorfman disease, or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), is a rare benign disease of unknown etiology that involves the cervical lymph nodes. Histologic findings include emperiopolesis of lymphocytes and S-100 protein positivity. Extranodal involvement occurs in 30?40% of cases, often involving skin. However, cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease without lymph node involvement is uncommon. We describe a case of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease and discuss its clinical and histopathologic findings. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-year history of a slowly enlarging violaceous mass on the mid-upper abdomen. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma two-year ago and was asymptomatic without any systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed a large, violaceous mass of mid-upper abdomen with several violaceous nodules surrounding the periphery. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Punch biopsy showed diffuse dermal infiltrates composed of central xanthomatous cells surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Focal germinal center was noted. Immunostaining revealed strong S-100 and CD68 reactivity of central xanthomatous cells and kappa and lambda polyclonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Special stains for infectious disorder were negative. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign reactive process, often under-recognized due to lack of systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. A high index of diagnostic awareness is required for its recognition.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare and recently described disease which occurs in patients with a history of renal disease and is often associated with hemodialysis or renal transplants. The usual presentation is multiple indurated plaque lesions resembling scleromyxedema on the extremities and trunk. Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy has been described in association with calciphylaxis and metastatic calcification, however, to our knowledge, the occurrence of osteoid metaplasia has not been previously reported. We report a case of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with osteoid metaplasia in a 78-year-old female patient with chronic renal failure on dialysis. The patient had a relatively acute onset (a few months) of lesions with irritation and pruritis of the lower extremities. Biopsies showed fibrous thickening of the dermis with islands of osteoid tissue with osteoblastic rimming. Calcification and lamellar bone formation were not seen. An Alcian blue stain demonstrated increased dermal mucin. Elastic stains showed prominent elongated elastic fibers between collagen fibers and within osteoid areas. The differential diagnosis included scleromyxedema and other fibrotic disorders. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown. Although rare patients improve with correction of renal abnormalities, currently no effective treatment is available.

AB  - Spectral Imaging Microscopy (SIM) is a technique for performing image-enabled spectroscopic analysis using a standard light microscope. We employed a prototype to a current, commercially available, spectral imaging system (NuanceTM, CRI, Inc.) that electro-optically selects narrow bands of light to be collected by a cooled, monochrome CCD camera. For each sample, images were taken every 10?nm from 420?nm to 720?nm to create a spectral image ?stack.? Analysis of the images with a prototype to the Nuance TM Analyze software (CRI, Inc.) gave both standard color (RGB) and spectral information at each pixel of the images. A representative 40x field was spectrally imaged from H&E slides of 104 biopsy specimens of mycosis fungoides (MF). Optical densities and spectral properties of small lymphocytes were determined. Hyperchromatic cells were pseudocolored to show their distribution. In addition to the important architectural features of MF, SIM can define whether hyperchromatic or normochromatic small lymphocytes are epidermotropic in the lesion by setting appropriate threshold values. Hyperchromasia can be attributed to increased nuclear eosinophilia or basophilia. These differences are difficult to estimate by eye. Since lymphoblasts have enlarged nuclei with dispersed chromatin, a combination of spectral and spatial data is required for their analysis.

AB  - Porocarcinomas are thought to be differentiated into the acrosyringeal portion of the sweat duct, and they are relatively rare. It may develop from a long standing eccrine poroma undergoing malignant transformation or may arise de novo. We evaluated pathological and immunohistocheimical findings of six cases of eccrine porocarcinoma. Special stains (PAS and PAS with diastase) and immunohistochemical stainings (CEA, CAM5.2, CK7, bcl-2, p53 protein, and MIB-1) were performed. We observed asymmetrical architecture, cytological pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, ductal differentiation, intracytoplasmic lumina, mitotic activity, and melanin colonization. Three patients were male and four patients were female. The average age was 76 years. The time interval from tumor onset to treatment ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The mean size was 3.2?cm, and the mean depth of invasion was 1.0?cm. Four tumors were found on the head, one on the hip, and one on the foot. Regional lymph node metastases were noted in one case. Microscopically, luminal spaces and intracytoplasmic lumina were noted in all cases. Immunohistochemically, the mean MIB-1 index was 41%. P53 immunoreactivity was detected in five cases. Interestingly, a case of porocarcinoma with lymph node metastases showed high mitotic figures as well as less lymphocytic infiltration.

AB  - Sclerotic fibroma is an uncommon benign neoplasm of the skin which may occur sporadically in a solitary form or as multiple lesions as a component of Cowden?s disease. Sclerotic fibromas have a distinctive histologic appearance characterized by well-circumscribed, hypocellular dermal nodules of thick, hyalinized collagen bundles arranged in a whorled or storiform pattern with prominent clefts. We present the case of a 52-year-old HIV-positive, African-American female who presented with multiple firm flesh-colored nodules of several year duration on bilateral lower extremities. Biopsies of the lesions demonstrated characteristic features of sclerotic fibroma. Detailed physical examination and extensive systemic work-up failed to reveal evidence of Cowden?s disease. To our knowledge, multiple sclerotic fibromas have not been reported in the absence of Cowden?s disease, and this is the first reported case of multiple sclerotic fibromas occurring in an HIV-positive patient without evidence of Cowden?s disease.

AB  - Infantile fibromatosis (IF) is an uncommon childhood disorder characterized by solitary or muticentric tumors involving skeletal muscle, skin, bones, or viscera. There is a wide morphologic spectrum reflecting various stages of fibroblastic differentiation. We present the clinical and histopathologic findings of a rare case of IF. A seven month old female presented with firm masses over the right elbow (2???3?cm.) and right distal clavicle (3???4?cm.). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated increased T2 signal within the soft tissues of the right axilla, supraclavicular region, and distal humerus. However, there was no evidence for bony involvement. Incisional biopsy of the supraclavicular mass showed a white fibrous grossly appearing tumor. Histologic examination revealed clusters of adipocytes and infiltration of skeletal muscle fibers by a moderately cellular proliferation of ovoid within a fibrous background. There was no atypia, necrosis, or increased mitotic activity. The tumor cells showed diffuse immunoreactivity for vimentin and weak focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. No reactivity was seen with S100. In addition, none of the tumor cells exhibited nuclear estrogen receptor expression by image cytometry. This case is reported in an effort to better define the clinical and histopathologic features of infantile fibromatosis.

AB  - We report a 43-year-old woman, in otherwise excellent health, who presented with a 4 year history of an asymptomatic, papular condition described as ?tiny little spines? involving the skin. On examination hundreds of discrete, palpable 1-mm projections were present on the upper torso and arms. Histopathology showed a small focus of acanthotic epidermis forming a small spire. Overlying the subtle epidermal elevation was a column of compact hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. Epidermal atrophy and dermal lymphocytic inflammation, characteristic of Flegel?s disease, were not observed. No features of keratosis pilaris were noted. A diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses was rendered. Relatively rare multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses is a non-follicular disorder of keratinization of unclear etiology. Previously ascribed names include, but are not limited to, disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and minute aggregate keratoses. A classification scheme with sporadic, post-inflammatory (recently challenged as another entity) and familial (autosomal dominant) types has been proposed. Other classifications are based on topography and histology or age of onset: early (20?s and 30?s) and late (40?s-50?s). Paraneoplastic syndromes have been associated with late onset type. In summary, we report a sporadic case of late-onset multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, an unusual and relatively rare disorder.

AB  - Incidence of invasive melanoma is reported to be steadily increasing worldwide. Whether due to an actual increase in disease, or increased surveillance and changes in diagnostic criteria, or both is unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze Clark Level and Breslow thickness trends in a population-based sample over five decades. All cases of invasive melanoma, a total of 200, diagnosed from 1985?1999 were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project that incorporates medical-surgical index information for all residents of Rochester/Olmsted County. These findings updated two previous studies of invasive melanoma from 1950?1985, resulting in 296 total cases over the 1950?1999 period. The incidence of Clark level II lesions increased from 0% in 1950?1959 to 51% in 1990?1999, while Clark level V lesions decreased from 38% to 4%. Moreover, the incidence of lesions with Breslow 4?mm decreased from 25% to 7%. These variations were found to be statistically significant (p?=?<0.01). The decreases in Clark level and Breslow thickness seen in this population-based sample over the last 5 decades suggests that a significant component of increased invasive melanoma incidence may be explained by increased surveillance and earlier detection.

AB  - A 25-year-old man presented with a large, undermined, violaceous ulcer with hemorrhagic crust on his nose for 1 year. It began as a ?pimple?. He had similar lesions on his scalp, abdomen and groin. His sister has Crohn?s and his mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Screening blood tests and CT scans revealed no underlying disease. The clinical impression was pyoderma gangrenosum. Biopsies from the nose and abdomen revealed dense superficial and mid-dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate composed of enlarged, atypical lymphocytes with focal epidermotropism and epidermal necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed the infiltrate was primarily CD3 positive T-cells without deficiency of CD4, CD7 or CD8. CD30, TIA and Granzyme were not detected. A T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected. Flow cytometry was negative. This is a case of pyoderma gangrenosum-like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of cutaneous lymphoma that clinically resembles PG, but histologically and immunohistochemically is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although rare, PG-like ulcers should be added to the list of atypical manifestations of CTCL. This case highlights the need to evaluate all atypical lymphocytic infiltrates thoroughly with immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangement. The diagnosis must be made with caution as proliferative clones of lymphocytes can be found in true PG.
