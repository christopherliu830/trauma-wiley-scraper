AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Abstract Recently, we found that resident myogenic stem satellite cells upregulate a multi-functional secreted protein, semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), exclusively at the early-differentiation phase in response to muscle injury; however, its physiological significance is still unknown. Here we show that Sema3A impacts slow-twitch fiber generation through a signaling pathway, cell-membrane receptor (neuropilin2-plexinA3) ? myogenin-myocyte enhancer factor 2D ? slow myosin heavy chain. This novel axis was found by small interfering RNA-transfection experiments in myoblast cultures, which also revealed an additional element that Sema3A-neuropilin1/plexinA1, A2 may enhance slow-fiber formation by activating signals that inhibit fast-myosin expression. Importantly, satellite cell-specific Sema3A conditional-knockout adult mice (Pax7CreERT2-Sema3AflÂ°x activated by tamoxifen-i.p. injection) provided direct in vivo evidence for the Sema3A-driven program, by showing that slow-fiber generation and muscle endurance were diminished after repair from cardiotoxin-injury of gastrocnemius muscle. Overall, the findings highlight an active role for satellite cell-secreted Sema3A ligand as a key ?commitment factor? for the slow-fiber population during muscle regeneration. Results extend our understanding of the myogenic stem-cell strategy that regulates fiber-type differentiation and is responsible for skeletal muscle contractility, energy metabolism, fatigue resistance, and its susceptibility to aging and disease.

AB  - Summary Circulatory and respiratory effects of five h of constant 1.06 per cent alveolar halothane in oxygen were identified in eight healthy horses, which breathed spontaneously, were otherwise unmedicated and positioned in sternal recumbency. Only a few important significant (P<0.05) changes occurred with time. Total peripheral resistance was about 15 per cent lower after two hours of constant dose halothane than after 30 mins of constant dose (P<0.05) and accounted for the significant 10 per cent reduction in mean carotid arterial blood pressure. By 5 h, the reduction in resistance and arterial blood pressure was 20 and 25 per cent respectively. Heart rate increased progressively with time and the increase became significant at 5 h (15 per cent increase). However, the heart rate change was not large enough to alter cardiac output. There were no major time-related changes in PaO2 or PaCO2. Three of four horses recovered from anaesthesia had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels and clinical signs of severe post anaesthetic myopathy.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been under development for several decades, but so far none has completed clinical trials due to safety issues, including fundamental concerns regarding hemoglobin-induced vasoconstriction and oxidative reactions. The question becomes whether these attributes are inherent to the hemoglobin molecule itself, or if the molecule can be modified in such a way as to avoid untoward side effects. To this end, Sangart designed a new type of oxygen therapeutic, Hemospan?, based on site-specific, maleimide poly(ethylene) glycol conjugation chemistry. The product, also referred to as MP4, is neither vasoconstrictive nor does it promote oxidation in vivo. The design principles were three-fold: (i) increase hemoglobin molecular size to prolong intravascular retention; (ii) increase oxygen affinity to prevent premature unloading of oxygen in the arterioles, thus avoiding arteriolar vasoconstriction; and (iii) optimize colloidal osmotic pressure and viscosity to enhance blood flow. Preclinical studies with Hemospan in animal models of hemodilution and hemorrhage show maintenance of blood pressure and cardiac output, with improved oxygen delivery compared to early-generation products of cross-linked and polymerized hemoglobins. Four Phase I and II clinical trials have been completed, showing that Hemospan is generally well tolerated in humans, with additional evidence of efficacy through Hemospan's capacity to impart hemodynamic stability in surgical patients. Two multi-center Phase III trials of Hemospan in orthopedic surgery are now underway in Europe.

AB  - Abstract The paper provides a brief overview of the use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the areas of bone regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of bone defects caused by trauma, non-union, and bone tumor excision, still faces many challenges despite the intense investigations and advancement in bone-tissue engineering and bone regeneration over the past decades. IONPs have promising prospects in this field due to their controlled responsive characteristics in specific external magnetic fields and have been of great interest during the last few years. This Minireview aims to summarize the relevant progress and describes the following five aspects: (i) The general introduction of IONPs, with a focus on the magnetic properties as the base of application; (ii) using IONPs as tools to study and control stem cells for better treatment efficacy in stem-cell-based bone defect repair; (iii) the use of IONPs and their complexes in the delivery of therapeutic agents, including chemical drug molecules, growth factors, and genetic materials, to promote osteogenesis-related cell function and differentiation, healthy bone tissue growth, and functional reconstruction; (iv) magneto-mechanical actuation in the regulation of cells distribution, mechano-transduction membrane receptors activation, and mechanosensitive signaling pathways regulation, and (v) fabrication, characteristics, and in?vitro and in?vivo osteogenic effects of magnetic composite bone scaffolds. Ongoing prospects are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract.? Loell I, Lundberg IE (Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Stockholm, Sweden) Can muscle regeneration fail in chronic inflammation: a weakness in inflammatory myopathies? (Review) J Intern Med 2010; 269: 243?257. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), collectively termed myositis, include three major subgroups: polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis. IIMs are characterized clinically by muscle weakness and reduced muscle endurance preferentially affecting the proximal skeletal muscle. In typical cases, inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and eicosanoids are present in muscle tissue. Treatment with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressants results in improved performance, but complete recovery is rarely seen. The mechanisms that cause muscle weakness and reduced muscle endurance are multi-factorial, and different mechanisms predominate in different phases of disease. It is likely that a combination of immune-mediated and nonimmune-mediated mechanisms contributes to clinical muscle symptoms. Immune-mediated mechanisms include immune cell-mediated muscle fibre necrosis as well as direct effects of various cytokines on muscle fibre contractility. Among the nonimmune-mediated mechanisms, an acquired metabolic myopathy and so-called endoplasmic reticulum stress may be important. There is also a possibility of defective repair mechanisms, with an influence of both disease-related factors and glucocorticoid treatment. Several proinflammatory molecules observed in muscle tissue of myositis patients, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-15, tumour necrosis factor, high-mobility group box-1 and eicosanoids, have a role in muscle fibre regeneration, and blocking these molecule may impair muscle repair and recovery. The delicate balance between immunosuppressive treatment to downregulate proinflammatory molecules and an inhibitory effect on muscle fibre regeneration needs to be further understood. This would also be relevant for other chronic inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Background High-intensity resistance training (HIRT) programmes are increasingly popular amongst personal trainers and those attending gymnasiums. We report the experience of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) at two tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Aims To compare the clinical outcomes of ER with other causes of rhabdomyolysis. Methods Retrospective cross-sectional study of patients presenting with a serum creatine kinase (CK) of greater than 25 000 units/L from 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2014 at two tertiary referral hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Records were examined to identify care measures implemented during hospital stay, clinical outcomes during admission and on subsequent follow up. Results Thirty four cases of rhabdomyolysis with a CK of greater than 25 000 units/L (normal range: 20?180 units/L) were identified during the 12-month study period. Twelve of the 34 cases (35%) had ER with 10 of 12 related to HIRT. No acute kidney injury, intensive care admission or death were seen among those with ER. All cases were managed conservatively, with 11 admitted and 9 receiving intravenous fluids only. In contrast, patients with rhabdomyolysis from other causes experienced significantly higher rates of intensive care admission (64%, P = 0.0002), acute kidney injury (82%, P = 0.0001) and death (27%, P = 0.069). Conclusion ER resulting from HIRT appears to have a benign course compared with rhabdomyolysis of other aetiologies in patients with a serum CK greater than 25 000 units/L. Conservative management of ER appears to be adequate, although this requires confirmation in future prospective studies.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Background Severe rhabdomyolysis is associated with acute kidney injury, but it is unclear if patients developing rhabdomyolysis after illicit drug use have a higher risk of acute kidney injury compared to other causes. Aims To provide a descriptive analysis of patients admitted with rhabdomyolysis, with a focus on illicit drug use, and to determine if illicit drug use was an independent predictor for acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy. Methods We conducted a 5-year cohort study of patients admitted to Monash Health, a tertiary referral hospital network. We identified adult patients with muscle injury from ICD-10 AM codes, serum creatine kinase level greater than 1000 U/mL, and a clinical history consistent with rhabdomyolysis. We determined the prevalence and type of illicit drug involved and determined the association between illicit drug use and renal outcomes by logistic regression. Results Of 643 patients, illicit drug use was identified in 12%. Acute kidney injury developed in 51%, and 5% required renal replacement therapy. Compared to the rest of the cohort, patients who used illicit drugs were younger and had higher peak serum creatine kinase, and developed a higher severity of acute kidney injury. In multivariable analysis, the factors associated with acute kidney injury were illicit drug use, peak creatine kinase, cardiovascular disease, concurrent sepsis and a clinically-evident pressure injury. Chronic kidney disease and need for fasciotomy were additional risk factors for renal replacement therapy. Conclusions Illicit drug use was associated with acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy independent of creatine kinase levels.

AB  - Abstract A mild swelling of the left periorbital was detected on a routine physical exam of a healthy captive adult peregrine falcon. Despite treatment, the swelling did not subside and within twenty-five days was causing significant exophthalmia and medial deviation of the left globe. A retrobulbar fusiform cell sarcoma was diagnosed with histopathology, then light microscopy and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis has been reported infrequently with salmonella infection. Since 1964, there have been at least 22 reports associated with gastroenteritis or bacteraemia. Twenty cases have been associated with non-typhoidal strains of Salmonella, with single reports of Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi and Typhi. A second case of typhoid fever associated with rhabdomyolysis was recently diagnosed in Ann Arbor, USA in a traveller returning from an endemic area. Prompt diagnosis and treatment resulted in a good outcome. Salmonella infection should be considered by clinicians as a possibility in the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.
