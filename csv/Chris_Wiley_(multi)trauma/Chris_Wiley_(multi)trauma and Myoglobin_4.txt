AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - Abstract Microchips for analytical purposes have attracted great attention over the last 20?years. In the present review, we focus on the most recent development of microchips for electrophoretic separation of proteins. This review starts with a short recalling about the microchips covering the basic microchip layout for CE and the commercial chips and microchip platforms. A short paragraph is dedicated to the surface treatment of microchips, which is of paramount importance in protein analysis. One section is dedicated to on-line sample pretreatment in microchips and summarizes different strategies to pre-concentrate or to purify proteins from complex matrixes. Most of the common modes used for CE of proteins have already been adapted to the chip format, while multidimensional approaches are still in progress. The different routes to achieve detection in microchip are also presented with a special attention to derivatization or labeling of proteins. Finally, several recent applications are mentioned. They highlight the great potential of electrophoretic separations of proteins in numerous fields such as biological, pharmaceutical or agricultural and food analysis. A bibliography with 151 references is provided covering papers published from 2000 to the early 2007.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy for hundreds of thousands of people who have severe impairment of gastrointestinal function. Trace elements are a small but very important part of PN that can be overlooked during busy practice. Serious complications can result from trace element deficiencies and toxicities, and this is especially problematic during times of product shortages. Practical information on parenteral trace element use can be gleaned from case reports, some retrospective studies, and very few randomized controlled trials. A general knowledge of trace element metabolism and excretion, deficiency and toxicity symptoms, products, optimal dosages, and strategies for supplementation, restriction, and monitoring will equip practitioners to provide optimal care for their patients who depend on PN.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - Summary This chapter proposes a number of exercise-generated mechanisms to influence the iron status of an athlete including hemolysis, hematuria, sweating, gastrointestinal bleeding, and injuries. The need to supplement athletes with iron was first suggested by the evidence of changes in blood cell counts and iron-associated parameters during periods of intense training or, even more accentuated, at the start of the training. This condition is known as ?sports anemia? and is common in endurance athletes. The hematological changes that occur during intense training are paralleled by the fall in ferritin concentration, mirroring a depletion of the body iron stores, even though ferritin levels also depend upon a number of other factors such as liver disease, alcohol consumption, infections, cardiovascular disease, and aging. Other parameters that can be used to monitor the iron status include sTfR, red blood cells (RBC) protoporphyrin, and stainable bone marrow iron (hemosiderin).

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

Common neurological conditions typically have distinctive clinical features often related to the anatomical site of the pathological process. A dermatome is a region of skin innervated by a single dorsal spinal nerve root. Lesions of each cranial nerve can lead to characteristic focal neurological signs. Imaging is a key investigative modality for many neurological disorders. Some modalities include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X-ray. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained via a lumbar puncture (LP), is useful in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Muscle biopsy can be used to investigate certain neuromuscular pathologies, e.g. dystrophy, myositis, myopathy, etc. Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a role in the management of a number of conditions, including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and coma states. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction.

This chapter explains the procedures commonly undertaken in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. It covers the tests including those involving blood and urine, radiological tests, invasive investigations, and methods of evaluating glomerular filtration rate. The chapter discusses investigations that are carried out prior to initiating anaemia treatments, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), as well as those used in cases of diminished response to ESAs. It evaluates the nurse's role in post-procedure care. The World Health Organization published guidelines on best phlebotomy practices, recommending standards for quality care that include laboratory sampling and the maintenance of quality control. Nurses must complete the necessary training before carrying out a new role, such as venepuncture.
