AB  - A case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by beta hemolytic streptococci is reported. A 66-year-old man was admitted because of pain and swelling in the right buttock. Rapid application of aspiration cytology made it possible to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis with bacterial infection. Unfortunately, however, the patient died of cardiac arrest due to hyperpotassemia 11 h after admission. Mortality from this disease is most often related to failure in recognizing it early. Rapid diagnosis and early treatment is mandatory in order to save the patients?life. We emphasize the usefulness of rapid aspiration cytology, despite the unfortunate outcome in the present case.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) within red blood cells (RBC) is protected from oxidative processes by enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants as well as the RBC membrane that provides a physical barrier against oxidation. When Hb is introduced into the circulation as a result of hemolysis or following infusion of Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs; ?blood substitutes?), the control of oxidative processes becomes dependent on plasma oxidative status. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that Hb and HBOCs undergo oxidative modification at the site of heme iron and at multiple amino acid sites as a result of autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation. Recent findings from in vitro studies provide a strong basis for understanding of potential toxicity in vivo. The antioxidative status of both plasma and tissue becomes an important factor in the control of Hb and HBOC oxidation and nitrosylation in the circulation. Several studies that performed ex vivo and in vivo have demonstrated a critical role for plasma antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and uric acid in maintaining Hb and HBOCs in functional non-oxidized states. In the present review we discuss mechanisms of Hb and HBOC autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we explore the role(s) of plasma antioxidants in maintaining functional HBOC status that may potentially be exploited as part of protective strategies against Hb and HBOC oxidative toxicity.

AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) represent a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive rapidly progressive necrosis that may involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia or muscle. Their progress is extremely fast, leading often to sepsis and septic shock that ends up in multiple organ failure with abrupt and high mortality. A variety of classification systems have been developed based on parameters such as anatomic location of the disease or microbiology. There are a number of factors that predispose to the spread of these soft tissue infections, such as delays in recognition, immune suppression, diabetes mellitus and advanced age. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics tends to mask the severity of the underlying infection, modulates the clinical presentation, and even delays hospital admission. The most important factor affecting outcome in NSTI is early diagnosis and aggressive radical surgical treatment. The medical records of 13 patients who had been treated for NSTI from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed, retrospectively. There were eight men (61.5%) and five (38.5%) women. Mean age was 56?years (range 27?73). Seven cases of infection involved the perineal region (54%), two the lower limb, one the upper limb and three the abdominal wall/trunk. The most common associated comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in five patients (38.5%). A single organism was identified in two (15%) and multiple organisms in 11 (85%) patients. Necrotizing aponeurositis Type I was the most common of the polymicrobial necrotizing infections. Overall survival was 85%, and the mean hospital stay for survivors was 35 days (range 17?92).
