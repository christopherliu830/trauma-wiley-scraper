AB  - Summary:? The interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts is regulated by reciprocal survival strategies, including competition for essential nutrients. Though paradoxical, mammalian hosts have learned to take advantage of amino acid catabolism for controlling pathogen invasion and, at the same time, regulating their own immune responses. In this way, ancient catabolic enzymes have acquired novel functions and evolved into new structures with highly specialized functions, which go beyond the struggle for survival. In this review, we analyze the evidence supporting a critical role for the metabolism of various amino acids in regulating different steps of both innate and adaptive immunity.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

Four of these tumours arose from paratesticular tissue and 2 were confined to the testis. Only 1 patient has died of his disease. Two were lost to follow-up after 21 years and are presumed cured. The remaining 3 remain alive and disease-free between 2 and 33 years after presentation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ewing sarcoma is a common primary bone malignancy occurring in childhood and adolescence. This case report describes a 4-year-old female patient who had Ewing sarcoma in the left clavicular region. The patient underwent total excision of the left clavicle and subsequently developed periodontitis and multiple carious lesions after chemotherapy. Caries risk and salivary flow rate tests were performed, followed by periodontal treatment, topical fluoride application, restoration of caries, and oral hygiene instruction. The care of this patient demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach is essential to eliminate all foci of infection, minimize morbidity, and improve the patient's general health before, during, and after oncological treatment.

AB  - Abstract A metastatic neuroblastoma arose in a posterior mediastinal tumor that had been present for at least 52 years. The diagnosis of neuroblastoma was first made when the patient was 81 years of age from biopsy of a metastatic lesion to the femur and later from biopsy of the mediastinal mass.

AB  - SUMMARY:? Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal failure are at greater risk of atypical presentations of myocardial ischaemia. Traditional markers of myocardial damage are often increased in renal failure in the absence of clinically suspect myocardial ischaemia. The cardiac troponins are specific markers of myocardial injury. Large-scale trials, excluding patients with renal disease, have shown the importance of the cardiac troponins in predicting adverse outcome and in guiding both therapy and intervention in acute coronary syndromes. Cardiac Troponin T and cardiac Troponin I are increased in patients with renal failure and this is likely to represent multifactorial pathology including cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac microinfarctions. Increases in serum troponin from baseline, in patients with renal disease with acute coronary syndromes, may represent a poor prognosis. Small studies of patients with renal failure have suggested that elevation of the cardiac troponins is associated with an increased risk of cardiac death.

AB  - Eccentric exercise affects muscles differentially according to intensity, duration, and previous exposure to the specific exercise activity. We used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences to localize and quantify muscle damage following step exercise and to determine correlations between transverse relaxation time (T2) and other markers of muscle damage. Eight women performed two-step exercise bouts (30?min) separated by 8 weeks. Blood samples, MR scans, measurements of muscle strength, and muscle soreness were obtained immediately before, after, and up to 9 days after each bout. Resting muscle T2 (40.3±0.6?ms) increased exclusively in m. Adductor magnus (AM) in the thigh performing eccentric contractions and peaked 3 days after bout 1 (73.5±9.7?ms, P<0.05). Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity peaked on day 3 after bout 1 and correlated with T2 in AM (r=0.96, P<0.001). After bout 2 CK and T2 were almost unaffected. This indicates that T2-weighted MRI can be applied to identify muscles from which enzymes are being released into the circulation.
