AB  - Abstract The cubic-diamond ? ?-tin phase transition in Si and Ge is studied using modern first-principles techniques based on density-functional theory (DFT) without making use of any experimental inputs. The relevant Gibbs energies, G(p,T) = U ? TS + pV, are obtained in the quasi-harmonic approximation from static internal energies and free-energy vibrational contributions in the two different phases, as computed by DFT and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), respectively. Our results show that the combination of the quasi-harmonic approximation and DFPT provides an efficient tool for the study of finite-temperature pressure-induced solid?solid phase transformations.

AB  - Combinatorial systems offer a way of using constraint to liberate design. London-based architect Natalie Gall investigated the possibilities of this in her fifth-year MArch thesis at the University of Greenwich. Entitled Arch Combinatoria, the project envisions the spaces in Leonora Carrington's magical Surrealist novel The Hearing Trumpet through a series of drawings on different scales, with portals allowing the viewer to connect between them. Gall describes the project, and the historical precedents that fed into it, in detail.

AB  - Summary Bacterial infections cause substantial mortality and burden of disease globally. Induction of a strong innate inflammatory response is the first common host mechanism required for elimination of the invading pathogens. The host transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) is essential for immune activation. Conversely, bacterial pathogens have evolved strategies to interfere directly with host cell signalling by regulating or mimicking host proteins. Given the key role of NF-?B in the host inflammatory response, bacteria have expectedly developed virulence effectors interfering with NF-?B signalling pathways. In this review, we explore the bacterial mechanisms utilized to prevent effective NF-?B signalling, which in turn usurp the host inflammatory response.

The hypothesis is that therapists working in a mental health organization experience significantly more burnout symptoms than do therapists working in private practice settings. The article discusses the factors that appear to lead to burnout and looks at how organizations can help their employees provide better care to clients. The results of the study examined here indicate that therapists working in mental health organizations experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and lower levels of personal accomplishment than therapists working in private practice.

AB  - Summary Viruses are the most abundant and diverse pathogens challenging the host immune system, and as such are a severe threat to human health. To this end, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade and subvert the host immune response. Host?pathogen interactions are usually initiated via recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host sensors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and DNA receptors. Effective sensing of PAMPs rapidly triggers host immune responses, via activation of complex signalling pathways that culminates in the induction of inflammatory responses and the eradication of pathogens. Activation of the nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) transcription pathway is crucial for the immediate early step of immune activation. This review discusses the recent evidence describing a variety of viral effectors that have been shown to prevent NF-?B signalling. Most of these viral effectors can be broadly classified into three categories based on the site of inhibition within the NF-?B pathway, that is, at the (i) TLRs, (ii) IKK complex or (iii) the transcriptional level.

AB  - Abstract Greek handwriting of the Middle Ages knew two basic scripts, majuscule (bilinear; i.e., most letters fitting between two virtual, lines), and minuscule (quadrilinear; i.e., most letters featuring ascending or descending strokes). Majuscule letters were the only acceptable book script of Antiquity and Late Antiquity. From the third through the eighth centuries CE and under the influence of Latin, which had already developed quadrilinear features, Greek minuscule script gradually evolved from a cursive version of documentary majuscule (De Gregorio 2000). Accordingly, minuscule script was first employed in the chancery context. The basic principle of majuscule was to write, or draw, each letter individually; that of minuscule was to ?string together? (syrmaiographein) as many letters as possible (Cortassa 2003; Luzzatto 2002?3). ?Scribal economy? guided the evolution of the initial minuscule canon; certain majuscule letters that were easily mistaken ? rounded E, ?, C, and diagonal ?, ?, ?, all differentiated by a single hairline, resulting in numerous scribal errors ? became easily differentiable in the new alphabet. However, it produced its own ?false friends,? such as H?K and, to a lesser degree, ???, so that by the tenth century certain majuscule letters were reinserted into the minuscule canon (H, K, N, ?, etc.), presumably also to satisfy the conservative taste of well-to-do patrons (Oikonomides 2000). Majuscule and minuscule scripts coexisted in various context-bound styles and on a sliding scale from formal to informal.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the challenges and approaches relating to mixing powders into liquids. When fine (micron or sub-micron size) powders are added in a liquid, they tend to form macroscale clusters, containing air and dry powder, thereby forming a hierarchy of structures. The process prepares a homogenous, fine dispersion that is stable with a narrow size distribution. The first requirement is therefore to achieve a suspension with particles incorporated into the liquid phase without settling. This pre-dispersion can then be processed further to reduce the size of the agglomerates and achieve a fine dispersion. These two main processes of interest, powder incorporation and deagglomeration or size reduction, are discussed in the chapter. The process device commonly used for powder incorporation is the stirred tank and in-line devices. The stirred tank can act as the holding tank or as the feed tank.

AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes guided tourists' space?time behavior in heritage sites and compares the results with the behavior of nonguided tourists. Data from 127 guided visitors from 127 different local tours and 1,242 nonguided tourists visiting the historic town city of Girona (Spain) were gathered from participant observation, GPS tracking, and questionnaires. Findings demonstrate that guided tourists have a more qualitative experience (less walking time, more time spent visiting monuments, more information, and sometimes privileged information) than have nonguided tourists. Despite this, results also suggest that tourists who take guided tours, and those who do not, show a very similar behavior pattern.

AB  - ABSTRACT This work dealt with the influence of the position of hydroxyl on the antioxidant capacity of metabolites of chlorogenic acid involving ferulic acid (FA), m- and p-coumaric acid (m- and p-CA). They were applied to protect DNA against the oxidations mediated by Cu2+/glutathione (GSH) and 2,2?-azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH). FA, m- and p-CA were also employed to inhibit the autoxidation of linoleic acid and AAPH-induced oxidation of methyl linoleate. Finally, they were used to scavenge 2,2?-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) cationic radical (ABTS+?), 2,2?-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and galvinoxyl radicals. It was found that FA, m- and p-CA exhibited similar activities to protect DNA against Cu2+/GSH-induced oxidation and to interact with ABTS+? m-CA exhibited low activity in AAPH-induced oxidations of DNA and methyl linoleate whereas p-CA exhibited high activity. FA exhibited much higher activity to trap DPPH and galvinoxyl radicals, revealing that para-hydroxyl group, especially with an adjacent methoxyl group, was beneficial for the antioxidant activity of coumaric acid. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The antioxidant effectiveness of ferulic acid, m- and p-coumaric acid in trapping radicals and protecting methyl linoleate and DNA against radical-induced oxidations has been investigated in this work. It was found that antioxidant activities of these compounds were composed of radical-reducing and radical-scavenging aspects. The hydroxyl adjacent to methoxyl is beneficial to scavenging radicals whereas hydroxyl at any position can play a radical-reducing role. The result presented herein will lead to a detailed recognition for the antioxidant mechanism of coumaric acid.

AB  - Abstract The diabetic effects of alloxan (type I diabetes mellitus) were investigated in 40 Wistar albino rats (18 controls and 22 diabetics). Alloxan in sterile physiological saline was injected into animals intravenously. After the induction of diabetes with alloxan, the ultrastructure of the capillaries in the gingiva was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The thickness of the basement membranes was observed closely adherent to the endothelial cells of the capillary alloxan-diabetic rats. It was greatly thickened owing to the increase in its amorphous, granular and filamentous material with occasional scattered collagen fibres. In some sections, the capillary lumens of the diabetics were closed by epithelial cells. Loss of cytoplasmic material and hyalinization were seen in some smooth muscle cells. In addition, the mitochondrial cristae of smooth muscle cell and epithelial cells disappeared. There was endothelial integrity throughout the smooth muscle cells.

AB  - Abstract The psychological and intellectual sequelae of childhood leukemia and its treatment were examined in 48 children with acute leukemia in long remission. Verbal and performance IQ values were determined in addition to full scale IQ. Performance was worse than the verbal IQ in children who were less than six years old at the time of diagnosis. Cranial irradiation even in repeated doses of 2,400 rads had no effect on these children's intellects. Most of the patients, however, showed severe emotional problems when constructing their ?world? from given objects. The frequency and severity of these emotional problems could be much alleviated by regular psychological care.

AB  - Abstract N-methyl-substituted diacylglycerol?indololactones (DAG?indololactones) are newly synthesized effectors of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and exhibit substantial selectivity between RasGRP3 and PKCα. We present a comprehensive analysis of membrane interactions and biological activities of several DAG?indololactones. Translocation and binding activity assays underline significant variations between the PKC translocation characteristics affected by the ligands as compared to their binding activities. In parallel, the fluorescent properties of the ligands were employed for analysis of their membrane association profiles. Specifically, we found that a slight change in the linkage to the indole ring resulted in significant differences in membrane binding and association of the DAG?indololactones with lipid bilayers. Our analysis shows that seemingly small structural modifications of the hydrophobic regions of these biomimetic PKC effectors contribute to pronounced modulation of membrane interactions of the ligands.
