AB  - Abstract: We investigated the inhibitory effect of stinging nettle leaf extract on the protease activity of botulinum neurotoxin type A and B light chains. The nettle leaf infusion was fractionated and HPLC-based enzymatic assays were performed to determine the capacity of each fraction to inhibit the protease activity of botulinum neurotoxin type A and B light chains. Assay results demonstrated that a water-soluble fraction obtained from the nettle leaf infusion inhibited type A, but did not inhibit type B light chain protease activity. The inhibition mode of water soluble fraction against protease activity of type A light chain was analyzed and found to be a non-competitive.

AB  - Abstract EPR spectra of gadolinium chelates were recorded showing electron spin relaxation enhancement due to intramolecular Gd(III)?Gd(III) interaction. This enhancement was separated from other relaxation processes by replacing successively Gd(III) by the very similar Y(III). X-band EPR line widths of the binuclear complex Gd2(OHEC)2? increase by a factor of 1.2 to 1.8 with respect to YGd(OHEC)2?. Electron spin relaxation of Gd(III) bound on the surface of micelles formed by gadofluorine 8 increases linearly with the mole fraction of Gd(III) versus Y(III). It has been shown that the increase in electron spin relaxation due to Gd?Gd interactions decreases 1H relaxivity measured on surrounding water protons. In the case of gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents this effect can limit maximum relaxivity achieved by optimizing rotational tumbling and water exchange process.

AB  - Abstract Hybrid vesicles of lipid and amphiphilic block copolymer combine the biological and functional versatility of lipid delivery systems with the mechanical stability and robustness of polymersomes. While studies of hybrid systems for ease of characterization have focused on giant vesicles, most encapsulation and release applications require nanoscale (large) unilamellar vesicles. We investigate the structure and physical characteristics important for thermal actuation of vesicle-forming blends of saturated phospholipid, polybutadiene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) and thermoresponsive polyisoprene-b-poly(N-isopropylacryl amide) that are additionally loaded with hydrophobic superparamagnetic nanoparticles in the vesicle membrane and resized to large unilamellar vesicles. Lipid/diblock copolymer hybrid vesicles are shown to be the most efficient option to trigger release of encapsulated compounds by application of an external magnetic field causing local hyperthermia. This superiority is shown to depend on the controlled formation of nanoscale lipid domains in the hybrid vesicle membrane and the efficient loading of hydrophobic nanoparticles into the diblock copolymer membrane that retains its stability.

AB  - Primary Familial Brain Calcification (PFBC) is a rare calcifying disorder of the brain with autosomal dominant inheritance, of unknown prevalence. Four causal genes have been identified so far: SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1, with pathogenic, probably pathogenic or missense variants of unknown significance found in 27.7% probands in the French PFBC series. Estimating PFBC prevalence from a clinical input is arduous due to a large diversity of symptoms and ages of onset and to incomplete clinical penetrance. Abnormal calcifications on CT scan can be used as a reliable diagnostic biomarker whatever the clinical status, but differential diagnoses should be ruled out including the challenging exclusion of common basal ganglia calcifications. Our primary aim was to estimate the minimal prevalence of PFBC due to a variant in one of the known genes. We extracted variants from the four known genes present in the gnomAD database gathering genomic data from 138,632 individuals. We interpreted all variants based on their predicted effect, their frequency, and previous studies on PFBC patients. Using the most conservative estimate, the minimal prevalence of PFBC related to a variant in one of the four known genes was 4.5 p. 10,000 (95%CI [3.4?5.5] p. 10,000). We then used variant detection rates in patients to extrapolate an overall minimal prevalence of PFBC to 2.1 p. 1,000 (95%CI [1.9?2.4] p. 1,000). The population-based genomic analysis indicates that PFBC is not an exceptionally rare disorder, still underestimated and underdiagnosed.

AB  - Summary Pantoea agglomerans (Pa), a widespread commensal bacterium, has evolved into a host-specific gall-forming pathogen on gypsophila and beet by acquiring a plasmid harbouring a type III secretion system (T3SS) and effectors (T3Es). Pantoea agglomerans pv. gypsophilae (Pag) elicits galls on gypsophila and a hypersensitive response on beet, whereas P. agglomerans pv. betae (Pab) elicits galls on beet and gypsophila. HsvG and HsvB are two paralogous T3Es present in both pathovars and act as host-specific transcription activators on gypsophila and beet, respectively. PthG and PseB are major T3Es that contribute to gall development of Pag and Pab, respectively. To establish the minimal combinations of T3Es that are sufficient to elicit gall symptoms, strains of the nonpathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens 55, Pa 3-1, Pa 98 and Escherichia coli, transformed with pHIR11 harbouring a T3SS, and the phytopathogenic bacteria Erwinia amylovora, Dickeya solani and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris were transformed with the T3Es hsvG, hsvB, pthG and pseB, either individually or in pairs, and used to infect gypsophila and beet. Strikingly, all the tested nonpathogenic and phytopathogenic bacterial strains harbouring hsvG and pthG incited galls on gypsophila, whereas strains harbouring hsvB and pseB, with the exception of E. coli, incited galls on beet.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and histopathological effects of tripeptide copper complex (TCC) and two different doses of laser application (helium-neon laser, 1 and 3 J cm?2) on wound healing with untreated control wounds. Experimental wounds were created on a total of 24 New Zealand white rabbits and topical TCC or laser was applied for 28 days. The wounds were observed daily, and planimetry was performed on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 to measure the unhealed wound area and percentage of total wound healing. Biopsies were taken weekly to evaluate the inflammatory response and the level of neovascularization. The median time for the first observable granulation tissue was shorter (P < 0.05) in the low and high dose laser groups than in the control group (3 and 2.66 vs. 4.5 days), but was not different between the TCC and control groups (4.16 vs. 4.5 days). Filling of the open wound to skin level with granulation tissue was faster (P < 0.05) in the TCC and high dose laser groups than in the control group (14 and 16 vs. 25 days), but was not different between the low dose laser and control groups (23 vs. 25 days). The average time for healing was shorter (P < 0.05) in the TCC and high dose laser groups (29.8 and 30.2 vs. 34.6 days), but was not different between the low dose laser and control groups (33.8 vs. 34.6 days). Histopathologically, wound healing was characterized by a decrease in the neutrophil counts and an increase in neovascularization. The TCC and high dose laser groups had greater neutrophil and vessel counts than in the control group, suggesting a more beneficial effect for wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Patulin is a mycotoxin that is produced by species of Penicillum, Aspergillus, and Byssochylamys molds that may grow on a variety of foods including fruit, grains and cheese. Patulin, at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1?bw?day?1 was administered orally to growing male rats aged 5?6 weeks for a period of 60 or 90 days. The dose of patulin used in the present study was based on estimated human exposure levels. At the end of these periods, the thymus glands of patulin-treated and control Wistar rats were removed and ultrastructural changes in capillary cells of the thymus of patulin-treated Wistar rats were determined by electron microscopy. The walls of thymus capillaries of the 60-day patulin-treated rat groups (P-60) exhibited degeneration observable in electron microscopic sections. For example, loss of cytoplasm and mitochondrial cristae of cells, swollen endothelial cells, increased thickness of the basement membrane, closed lumen of capillaries, accumulation of fibrous material at the periphery of the capillaries and nuclear anomalies were seen in these sections. Such degeneration and changes were also observed in sections of capillaries of the 90-day patulin-treated rat groups (P-90). The levels of degeneration of endothelial cell nucleus of P-90 were greater than those of P-60. This study demonstrated the ultrastructural degeneration of thymus capillary cells of patulin-treated rats. The results obtained from this study may provide a guide to research dealing with the toxic effects of patulin on tissue and organ ultrastructure. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the fabrication and composition of hydrogels along with their different properties, and the natural and synthetic polymers used for the development of hydrogels in the presence of different crosslinking agents. The major characteristics of hydrogels related to clinical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical applications are identified, particularly for the applications of hydrogels in contact lenses, oral drug delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering matrices, and gene delivery. Natural polymer-based hydrogels attract great interest and are suitable for drug delivery and tissue engineering of bioactive molecules. Hydrogels can be classified into three types based on their source: natural polymer-based hydrogels, synthetic polymer-based hydrogels, and hybrid hydrogels. Polyimide hydrogels are extensively used in reconstructive and plastic surgery. In photocrosslinking, polymers that can form hydrogels can be developed by using photosensitive functional groups.

AB  - Summary Pantoea agglomerans pv. gypsophilae (Pag) elicits galls on gypsophila and a hypersensitive response on beet, whereas P.?agglomerans pv. betae (Pab) induces galls on both beet and gypsophila. The pathogenicity of both pathovars is dependent on the presence of a plasmid harbouring type III secretion system (TTSS) components and effectors. The HsvG TTSS effectors of Pag (HsvG-Pag) and Pab (HsvG-Pab) determine the host specificity of both pathovars on gypsophila. Here we describe a novel HsvG homologue, HsvB, which determines the host specificity of Pag and Pab on beet. HsvG requires two direct amino acid repeats for pathogenicity on gypsophila, whereas one repeat in HsvB is sufficient for pathogenicity on beet. Exchanging repeats between HsvG-Pag and HsvB-Pab resulted in a switch of host specificities. Transient expression of GFP?HsvG or GFP?HsvB fusions in gypsophila, beet or melon leaves showed that HsvG and HsvB were localized to the nuclei of host and non-host plants. A yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that a single repeat of HsvG or HsvB was sufficient to activate transcription. By employing random binding-site selection and gel-shift assay HsvG was demonstrated to be a double-stranded DNA-binding protein with an ACACC/aAA consensus binding site. These results suggest that HsvG and HsvB are host-specificity determinants and bear the potential to affect the host transcriptional machinery.

AB  - Abstract A systematic characterization of the competing kosmotropic and chaotropic effects of a series of divalent salts on the aqueous H-bonding structure by means of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations is presented. The structural properties are quantified by means of experimental and computed 1H?NMR chemical shifts, whereby the local environments of cations and anions can be discriminated. Complementary to the well-established structural features, a dynamical aspect is added to the concept of kosmotropes and chaotropes. The H-bond dynamics, quantified in terms of the H-bonding autocorrelation functions, shows a good correlation with the structural kosmotropic and chaotropic modifications, which are commonly referred to as the Hofmeister series. The considerably enhanced (reduced) fluctuations of the H-bonding network in the hydration shells around the anions (cations) are a complementary dynamical dimension to the concept of kosmotropic/chaotropic behavior of solvated ions.

AB  - Abstract Variable-temperature, multiple magnetic field 17O NMR, EPR and variable-temperature 1H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) measurement techniques have been applied to Gadomer 17, a new dendritic contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. The macromolecule bears 24 Gd(dota)?monoamide chelates (dota=N,N?,N?,N???-tetracarboxymethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) attached to a lysine-based dendrimer. 17O NMR and 1H NMRD data were analysed simultaneously by incorporating the Lipari?Szabó approach for the description of rotational dynamics. The water exchange rate k$\rm{_{ex}^{298}}$ was found to be (1.0±0.1)?106 s?1, a value similar to those measured for other Gd(dota)?monoamide complexes, and the activation parameters ?H?=24.7±1.3 kJ mol?1 and ?S?=?47.4±0.2 J?K?1 mol?1. The internal flexibility of the macromolecule is characterised by the Lipari?Szabó order parameter $\rm{\cal S}$2=0.5 and a local rotational correlation time τ$\rm{_{l}^{298}}$= 760 ps, whereas the global rotational correlation time of the dendrimer is much longer, τ$\rm{_{g}^{298}}$=3050 ps. The analysis of proton relaxivities reveals that, beside slow water exchange, internal flexibility is an important limiting factor for imaging magnetic fields. Electronic relaxation, though faster than in similar, but monomeric, GdIII chelates, does not limit proton relaxivity of this contrast agent (r1=16.5?mM?1?s?1 at 298 K and 20 MHz). This analysis provides direct clues for the design of high-efficiency contrast agents.

AB  - Abstract Background Different serum creatinine (sCr) assays may obtain different values in the same patient, causing discrepancies in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and sCr-based vancomycin dosing calculations. Objective To identify potential discrepancies in sCr concentrations obtained by different assays, the compensated Jaffe (sCr-Jaffe) and the enzymatic (sCr-enz), and to compare between the eGFR and vancomycin daily dose, based on these sCr values. Method sCr-Jaffe and, sCr-enz concentrations of 890 healthy children, aged 1?18 years, were available from the Canadian Laboratory Initiative in Pediatric Reference Intervals study in Ontario. For each subject, eGFR (eGFR-Jaffe, eGFR-enz) was calculated using the revised Schwartz equation, and vancomycin daily dose (Vdose-Jaffe, Vdose-enz) was calculated using a sCr-based pharmacokinetic model. Result Significant, age-related differences were found in sCr concentrations, and in subsequent eGFR and Vdose, between the two assays. In children aged 1?5 years, mean sCr-Jaffe was higher than sCr-enz (44.0?±?5.0 vs. 27.7?±?7.3??mol/L, P?<?0.001), leading to lower eGFR-Jaffe (83.2?±?9.0 vs. 137.9?±?27.1?mL/min/1.73m2, P?<?0.001) and lower Vdose-Jaffe (44.7?±?2.5 vs. 53.5?±?5.1?mg/kg/24?h, P?<?0.001). Conclusion Based on these findings, young children may be at risk for vancomycin under-treatment. Further research is needed to define the more accurate sCr assay in young children treated with renally excreted drugs.

AB  - Abstract Background Incidences of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the lower extremities in elderly patients are rising. Surgical approaches to the treatment of BCC are subject to possible difficulties in healing, failure of skin grafts, and wound infection. This study assessed the efficacy of intralesional cryosurgery in the treatment of BCC of the lower limbs in elderly patients. Methods This study included eight patients aged >60 years in whom a total of 10 nodular or superficial BCCs of the lower limbs were confirmed by biopsy. The patients' medical histories revealed comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, venous insufficiency, and deep vein thrombosis of the legs, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and ischemic heart disease. Using liquid nitrogen, an intralesional cryosurgery needle (CryoShape) was inserted into the tumor to facilitate its complete freezing. Treatment success was confirmed by biopsy taken approximately 3 months after complete healing of the cryo-wound. Results The average size of the lesions treated was 2.49 cm2 (16.4 ? 15.2 mm). Mean recovery time was 79.9 days. Biopsies were obtained at a mean of 85.3 days after the wound had healed. All 10 biopsies verified the complete destruction of the tumor. There was no evidence of wound infection or tumor recurrence over a follow-up period of 28 months. Conclusions This study demonstrates that a single intralesional cryosurgery session can completely eradicate BCC on the lower extremities in elderly patients. This technique is associated with relatively minor complications, is well tolerated, and represents a safe and effective therapeutic modality for BCC of the lower limbs.

AB  - Abstract The morphological changes of gingival mast cells of alloxan-induced diabetic rats were studied by electron microscopy. The following observations were made. The cell nucleus and cytoplasm degenerated. The electron density of the granules in the cell cytoplasm clearly decreased. Some granules had dense irregular threads and the granules were surrounded by a thin vacuole. A ghost vacuole formed in some mast cells and disorganized materials accumulated in the cytoplasm. The mast cell nuclei were generally irregular and degenerating mast cells had pyknotic nuclei. General destruction of the cell membrane and granule shedding in some samples was noted and mitochondria with atypical cristae in the cytoplasm of the mast cells were seen. We conclude that the characteristics of the ultrastructure of gingival mast cells in diabetics are distinctive and should be used as criteria for pathogenesis of gingival inflammation.
