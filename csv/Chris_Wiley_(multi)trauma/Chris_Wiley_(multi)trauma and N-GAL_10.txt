AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.

AB  - ObjectiveTo compare prescription data for Australia with drugs ingested in self-poisoning and suicide, to determine which drugs are over-represented. DesignComparison of data on drugs taken in self-poisoning admissions and suicides with Australian prescription drug dispensing data from the Drug Utilization Subcommittee (DUSC). SettingNewcastle and Lake Macquarie, Australia, 1989-1992. SubjectsBetween July 1989 and June 1992, 1159 prescription drugs were taken in overdose. Eighty-three drug-related deaths were investigated by the coroner between 1987 and 1992. On 48 occasions a prescription drug was the primary cause of death. ResultsDrugs over-represented in self-poisoning (relative to Australian prescriptions) included not only those prescribed for psychiatric conditions (antidepressants, neuroleptics and lithium), but also benzo-diazepines, barbiturates and other anticonvulsants. The highest odds ratios for death when adjusted for prescription numbers were for short-acting barbiturates (523.7; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 207-1322), chloral hydrate (58.1; 95% Cl, 18.1-187), colchicine (27.9; 95% Cl, 3.8-202), dextropropoxyphene (20.8; 95% Cl, 8.8-48.9), tricyclic antidepressants (13.3; 95% Cl, 7.2-24.5) and anticonvulsants (11.6; 95% Cl, 4.1-32.2). ConclusionsShort-acting barbiturates, chloral hydrate and dextropropoxyphene have little or no clinical advantage over alternatives and excessive toxicity in overdose. They should be removed from the market. The toxicity of anticonvulsants and colchicine should be con-sidered when they are prescribed, and smaller amounts per prescription may be advisable for high risk patients using these and other toxic drugs.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - The structure and topography of the Bursa of Fabricius (BF) differs from other central immune organs. Structural components, providing BF function are located in mucosa, which is constantly influenced by antigen stimulation. Therefore the reports, which have appeared recently, indicate that BF may function as a peripheral immune organ. The latter is known to be situated in the alimentary canal mucosa (caecal tonsils, Peyer's patches) and possess peculiar epithelium. The aim of our study was to investigate the structure and cell composition of BF epithelium in chicken, turkey, quails, ducks and pigeons using light and electronic microscopy. The studies have shown that epithelium overlying BF folds is pseudostratified columnar, but between them and in their base it might be cuboidal or columnar. Pseudostratified epithelium consists of columnar cells with a few microvilli on their apical surface, goblet cells, infrequent endocrine cells and macrophages. BF epithelium is spongious due to its infiltration by lymphoid cells. The large quantity of the latter is found in subepithelial connective tissue. Infiltration by lymphoid cells is considered to be typical for the alimentary tract mucosa, where the aggregated lymphoid nodules are situated. Thus, our study supports the thoughts that BF may have function of central and peripheral immune organ.

AB  - Investigations were performed on 10 adult individuals of chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger), midday gerbil (Gerbillus gerbillus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) and Egyptian spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus). The animals were killed with ether anaesthesia and injected with coloured acryl latex through the abdominal aorta or left heart ventricle. The heads of the animals were fixed in formalin and after decalcification in 5% HNO3, injected arteries of the base of the brain were exposed. The different types of arterial circle of the brain in investigated species were observed. The open type with morphological asymmetry in the anterior part was found in chinchilla. It depended on an unusually strongly developed anterior cerebral artery at the right side. In the midday gerbil the most common form was the closed type of investigated circle, with a lack of typical communicating artery posterior. The morphological asymmetry of the anterior part of the circle without fully developed anterior cerebral artery was found in the rabbit. Typical, the closed type of investigated structure with little individual variability was observed in guinea pig. The most individual variability connected with anterior and posterior part of the Willi's circle was found in the Egyptian spiny mouse where it was difficult to describe the typical arterial circle of the base of the brain.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells that due to their ability to homing to damaged tissues and differentiate into specialized cells, are remarkable cells in the field of regenerative medicine. It's suggested that the predominant mechanism of MSCs in tissue repair might be related to their paracrine activity. The utilization of MSCs for tissue repair is initially based on the differentiation ability of these cells; however now it has been revealed that only a small fraction of the transplanted MSCs actually fuse and survive in host tissues. Indeed, MSCs supply the microenvironment with the secretion of soluble trophic factors, survival signals and the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosome. Also, the paracrine activity of EVs could mediate the cellular communication to induce cell-differentiation/self-renewal. Recent findings suggest that EVs released by MSCs may also be critical in the physiological function of these cells. This review provides an overview of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles as a hopeful opportunity to advance novel cell-free therapy strategies that might prevail over the obstacles and risks associated with the use of native or engineered stem cells. EVs are very stable; they can pass the biological barriers without rejection and can shuttle bioactive molecules from one cell to another, causing the exchange of genetic information and reprogramming of the recipient cells. Moreover, extracellular vesicles may provide therapeutic cargo for a wide range of diseases and cancer therapy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a co-culture of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts in different types of perfusion chambers under defined conditions. The perfusion chamber PCS3c (Oligene, Berlin) was used to culture dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes separated by a Millicell? Insert (Millipore, Schwalbach). In addition novel perfusion chambers developed by Dirk Hoffmann were used in combination with S & S membrane filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel). First, fibroblasts were seeded onto one side of the insert/membrane and allowed to grow for 4 days. Subsequently keratinocytes were seeded onto the other side and allowed to adhere for one day. Then the chambers were connected to the tubing system with an attached 8-channel pump and a gas permeable media bag. We worked with different media and flow rates ranging from 0.035?ml/min to 0.35?ml/min. The system was run for up to 20?days. After a few days in culture the cells had grown to confluence. Then keratinocytes began to differentiate and built up stratified colonies. Within these colonies the cells showed the characteristic morphology of a stratified squamous epithelium. The use of perfusion chambers allows three-dimensional cultures to grow and survive for weeks, because of an unlimited medium supply and gas exchange. Additional, perfusion chamber systems enable the co-cultivation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes separated by membranes, which permit the exchange of molecules like growth factors. Furthermore, it is possible to perfuse the two different parts of the perfusion chamber with various and even different types of media. This provides the opportunity to add a growth factor to the medium for only one cell type and to study the effect of this factor to the other cell type.

AB  - Introduction:? Epidermal?dermal interactions play an important role in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and also in disease and regeneration of skin. A double paracrine regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation has been postulated and described in vitro recently. Interleukin-1 (Il-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF/FGF-7) and their receptors are major mediators in this epidermal-dermal signalling. Aim:? We wanted to generate evidence for a reciprocal regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation in the bovine claw involving Il-1 and KGF. Methods:? Tissue samples from claws of slaughtered cows, co-cultures and three-dimensional cultures of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used. Immunohistochemistry for Il-1 and Il-1 receptor, KGF and KGF receptor were carried out on frozen and paraffin sections from tissue and cell culture. RT-PCR was used to study regulation at the mRNA level in dermis and epidermis (after micro separation) and in fibroblasts and keratinocytes from the cultures respectively. Results:? In claw epidermis Il-1 was accumulated and KGF receptor was detectable. Interleukin-1 receptor and KGF were present in dermal cells. Il-1 stimulated fibroblasts responded with KGF expression in vitro. Neutralization of Il-1 reduced or stopped this effect. Keratinocytes co-cultured with fibroblasts showed a significant better growth. Presence of keratinocytes increased KGF expression in the co-cultured fibroblasts. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that Il-1 is leading to stimulation of KGF expression. KGF seems to be an important stimulator of keratinocyte proliferation in our co-culture system. So far our results provide initial evidence for a reciprocal regulatory mechanism present in the bovine claw involving Il- 1 produced in the epidermis and KGF originating from fibroblasts. Future in vitro studies including mRNA analysis will provide deeper insight into the epidermal-dermal cross-talk and the involved transcriptional/translational regulation in the bovine claw.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Introduction:? The interactions occurring between nervous and immune systems are well documented. These interactions involve several types of chemical messengers including hormones, cytokines, classic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It has been observed that the lymphoid organs receive a dense peptidergic innervation and immune cells produce neuropeptides. Neuropeptides, in turn, are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory processes and in the maturation of the lymphoid organs. Several studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory neuropeptides and their receptors are expressed in the thymus and bursa of fabricius. PACAP is a glucagon/VIP/secretin family peptide. It was originally isolated from the ovine hypothalamus and then it was found in the autonomic nervous system. PACAP is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary function, neurotransmission and neuromodulation. In the immune system, PACAP is expressed in lymphoid tissues of the rat and in the lymphocytes of the duck GALT. PACAP, therefore, could be a messenger of the dialogue between nervous and immune system. It may have a role in the regulation of the inflammatory processes by stimulating histamine and serotonin and modulating the production of the cytokines in immune cells. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of thymus and bursa of fabricius of the duck of different ages by using an antibody anti-PACAP38. Results and Discussion:? In the thymus, PACAP-immunoreactivity was found in lymphoid cells and, with a lesser extent, in epithelial reticular cells. The immunoreactive lymphocytes were primarily observed in the interlobular septa in close vicinity to the interlobular veins. The number of positive lymphocytes increased with ageing. In the bursa of fabricius, PACAP-IR was found in nerve fibres and in a few lymphoid cells. These results suggest that PACAP could play a role in the maturation and involution of these organs and in the immune functions.

AB  - Introduction and aims:? Claw diseases in dairy cows not only lead to high economic losses, but also cause pain and reduce animal welfare. Former studies pointed out that flooring properties influence the microstructure of hoof horn. In this study, we looked for correlations between different flooring systems and horn quality. We obtained horn samples from an experimental farm in Alnarp/Sweden from cows that were first kept on slatted floor and subsequently on mastic asphalt respectively on rubber mats. Methods:? Untreated horn samples were glued onto wooden blocks: 7??m sections were prepared with a Polycut-S (Leica) microtome and afterwards stained with the PAS reaction. For morphometrical analysis we used a Zeiss Axioskope, a digital camera (Progress 3012) and the Lucia 32 G software (Nikon). These data were exported into EXCEL (Microsoft) and statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS (SPSS Inc. [[Au: please provide manufacturer details for ?SPSS?: city, state code (if USA) and country]]). We measured area, minimal and maximal diameter of medulla and cortex of the horn tubules. Statistical evaluation included number of tubules and tubular area per visual field, total area of medulla and cortex and the limiting diameters. Results:? We found significant alterations of the hoof horn after moving the cows from hard to soft floor. The diameter of the horn tubules decreased significantly. The area of medulla and the ratio of medulla to cortex decreased as well. Conclusions:? Our findings indicate a higher quality of claw horn and an increased resistance against mechanical, chemical and microbial environmental influences in animals kept on soft floors. The functional implications of these observations are discussed with regard to claw health as well as the arising consequences for dairy housing systems.

AB  - We previously showed that Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, has profound effects on the process of wound healing by increasing both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of impaired porcine and murine repair. In the present study, using the scratch plate assay as an in vitro model of wound repair, we show that CRT (10?6?10?9?M) induces cell migration/wound closure in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts that is equivalent to EGF (positive control). Furthermore, by an MTS proliferation assay, CRT stimulated cellular proliferation of human keratinocytes (2-fold), fibroblasts (100-fold), and vascular endothelial cells (1.2-fold). Markedly increased cellular proliferation was confirmed by anti-ki67 immunostaining (IHC) which was confined to basal keratinocytes in the CRT-(5?mg/ml) treated porcine and murine wounds during reepithelialization and in numerous cells of the granulation tissue. Also, CRT increased dermal depth and granulation tissue formation between days 6?14 following injury (p?<?0.05). The effect of CRT on the dermal layer was qualitatively different than PDGF or PBS as there was a remarkably higher number of dermal cells that reconstituted the CRT-treated pig wounds, a more organized pattern of collagen organization by picrosirrius red staining, and greater fibronectin and TGF-?3 by IHC. CRT also increased tensile strength in a rat incisional wound model (p?<?0.005 @ 21 days). By Mac-138 IHC of porcine wounds, we observed an increase in macrophages in the wound bed compared to PDGF (p?<?0.013). Since the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is a CRT-dependent process, this finding suggests a potential role for CRT as a bacteriocidal and/or debriding agent. Unlike PDGF, CRT positively affects both the epithelial and dermal aspects of repair. Our studies suggest that CRT accelerates and improves the rate and quality of wound repair by affecting many cells involved in the repair process.

AB  - Summary The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was introduced as a stage in the Global Deterioration Scale to describe the progression from normal aging to dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. The potential clinical and demographic risk factors for developing AD at an earlier age of onset identified over the last three decades include depression, female gender, low levels of education, smaller head circumference, and family history of Down's syndrome. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a progressive dementia syndrome that is usually associated with parkinsonism and typically dominated by attentional, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction and relatively preserved memory. Vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, prion diseases, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are also discussed in the chapter.

AB  - Abstract Bio-engineered teeth that can grow and remodel in a manner similar to that of natural teeth have the potential to serve as permanent replacements to the currently used prosthetic teeth, such as dental implants. A major challenge in designing functional bio-engineered teeth is to mimic both the structural and anisotropic mechanical characteristics of the native tooth. Therefore, the field of dental and whole tooth regeneration has advanced towards the molecular and nanoscale design of bio-active, biomimetic systems, using biomaterials, drug delivery systems and stem cells. The focus of this review is to discuss recent advances in tooth tissue engineering, using biomimetic scaffolds that provide proper architectural cues, exhibit the capacity to support dental stem cell proliferation and differentiation and sequester and release bio-active agents, such as growth factors and nucleic acids, in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Although many in vitro and in vivo studies on tooth regeneration appear promising, before tooth tissue engineering becomes a reality for humans, additional research is needed to perfect methods that use adult human dental stem cells, as opposed to embryonic dental stem cells, and to devise the means to generate bio-engineered teeth of predetermined size and shape.

AB  - The expression of calbindin D-28k (CB), calretinin (CR), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the stomach myenteric plexus of the Korean native goat stomach was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated the presence of nerve fibers and cell bodies immunoreactive (IR) to CB, CR, SP and CGRP. In tissues of rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum, some distinct neuronal populations could be distinguished according to their morphologic and neuronal chemical properties: Dogiel type I cells which have irregular lamellar dendrites and a single axon, Dogiel type II cells which have large ovoid cell bodies and several long axon-like processes, and small filamentous interneurons. CB-, CR-, SP- and CGRP-IR neurons and fibers were observed in the myenteric plexus of stomach, and varicose nerve fiber immunostained to SP and CGRP also were found in the muscle layer. In myenteric plexus of the stomach, CB- and SP-positive neurons were characterized by Dogiel type II and CR-IR neurons were classified Dogiel type I with lamellar dendrites, and immunoreactivity of CGRP was very weak in the somata. SP- and CGRP-IR nerve fibers formed dense networks within the myenteric ganglia. SP-IR cell bodies and their fibers were found in the myenteric plexus, and the immunoreactivity and number of cell bodies were more than CB-, CR-, and CGRP-IR neurons. These results suggest that SP, CGRP, CB and CR in the myenteric neurons of Korean native goat stomach may have play an important role in the dynamic movement.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the CT anatomy of the normal loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) head using three loggerhead sea turtle heads. CT imaging was performed using the following parameters: K.v.: 120?mAs: 220, and a soft-tissue window (WW 1880, WL 465): Transverse and sagittal CT images were obtained. Detailed anatomy of the head was acquired with the sagittal and transverse series. The heads were frozen and then sectioned using an electric saw, to compare them with the CT images. In CT, the grey scale is directly related to the radiation attenuation of the head structures. The skull and hyoid bones, and the lower jaw were easily identifiable due to the high CT density image compared to adjacent or surrounding structures such as the respiratory system, oral cavity, oesophagus and cranial cavity that appeared as a low opacity. The nervous structures, salt gland, eyeball, ramphoteca structure and different muscles of the head had an intermediate CT density and appeared grey. CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head provided excellent detail of clinically relevant anatomy and correlated well with corresponding gross specimens. CT of the head has considerable advantages over other techniques: CT provides excellent spatial resolution and good discrimination between bone and soft tissue, and the structures are viewed without superimposition. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the head allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, which is a useful tool for the identification of the CT images. With developing technology, CT imaging may soon become more readily available for exotic animals imaging. In the same way, we consider it quite useful to be able to establish some references on head, in order to scan only selected parts during a clinical or experimental approach. The information presented in this communication should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Summary Dr Sophie Spitz proposed a criterion to distinguish those melanocytic proliferations of childhood that manifested an aggressive biologic behavior from their indolent, but histologically similar, counterparts. The latter are now called Spitz nevi. The Spitz nevus may be junctional, compound, or intradermal. This chapter discusses classical compound Spitz nevus, and dermal Spitz nevus and its nonmelanocytic mimics: neurothekeoma, epithelioid cell histiocytoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, and epithelioid angiosarcoma. The desmoplastic nevus is usually thought to represent a nevus, or, less commonly, a dermatofibroma. The chapter also discusses pagetoid intraepidermal Spitz nevus, pigmented spindle cell nevus, pigmented epithelioid cell nevus and superficial atypical Spitz tumor.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNs) of condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to characterize the microenvironment of individual neurons and the chemoarchitecture of some brain regions. In the present study, PNs in the hippocampus were visualized with a cationic iron colloid method for sulphated proteoglycan content and a plant lectin from Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) for N-acetylgalactosamine containing glycoconjugates. The ECM molecules were organized in reticular coats (PNs) around non-pyramidal cells in the Ammons horn (Corneu Ammons, CA) and subicular region, in addition to pyramidal neurons located in CA2 and CA3 regions. CA2 stratum pyramidale exhibited the most intense staining of its PNs and a diffuse intervening neutrophil labelling, while CA3 region showed a graded fashion of staining intensity. The subiculum displayed intensely stained perineuronal coats. Notably, the hippocampal perineuronal nets revealed overlapped staining characteristics with both staining methods. However, cell coats of the subicular neurons showed various degrees of labelling characteristics with both markers. It is suggested that the PNs in the hippocampus are correlated with the fast spiking inhibitory GABAergic neurons and their target pyramidal cells, and this is important to keep the excitatory elements under control and therefore control the information processes within the hippocampus.

AB  - Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression was established in the masseter, axial and limb skeletal muscles in 18 young dogs from late prenatal to 6?months of age. Results obtained by immunohistochemical procedure using 11 monoclonal antibodies, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Western-blotting and enzyme-histochemical reactions were compared to those found in skeletal muscles of adult dogs. In the skeletal muscles of both fetuses in the last stages of development and neonatal dogs, the developmental isoforms MHC-emb and MHC-neo were prevalent. During the first 10?days after birth, the level of embryonic isoform expression declined, as did that of the neonatal isoform during the second and third weeks. Correspondingly, the expression of MHC-IIa, and later, of MHC-I increased. By 6?weeks of age the presence of MHC-IIx became obvious. This transitional pattern was similar in all muscles except in the rhomboideus, where secondary slow fibres were present before birth. In the other muscles, only one primary, centrally located, slow fibre was present in a fascicle and the secondary slow fibres evolved from developmentally fast fibres between the second and third weeks of age. Our results indicate that timing of muscle maturation depends on its activity right after birth. The fastest developing muscles were the masseter muscle and the diaphragm. They were followed by others, postural and locomotory muscles. A pronounced swap from developmental to adult isoforms was noted between the 4th and 6th?week of age. At this age puppies are weaned and begin playing intensively and investigating their surroundings. The results of our study indicate that dog skeletal muscles exhibit an immature morphology at birth and develop relatively slowly compared to those of other domestic animals.
