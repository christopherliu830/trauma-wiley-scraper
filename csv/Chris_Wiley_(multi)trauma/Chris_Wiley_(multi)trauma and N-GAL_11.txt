AB  - This review covers selected 2013 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, anjmals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on joumal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine dismpters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due in part to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and the 2010 Japanese tswwmi. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g.some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB  - Extended healing time and lack of documented effective treatments of sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease create substantial problems. Locally applied zinc oxide has been reported to promote wound healing. We have compared topical zinc oxide (3%) with placebo meshes for pilonidal wounds healing by secondary intention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Sixty-four consecutive patients, 53 males, aged between 18 and 60 years (median 26 years) with excised pilonidal wounds were centrally randomized to local zinc oxide (30?mg/g, n?=?33) or to placebo (n?=?31) mesh treatment. Patients were followed with strict recording of beneficial and harmful effects. The median healing times were 54 days (42?71 days, interquartile range, n?=?33) for the zinc group and 62 days (55?82 days, n?=?31) for the placebo group. This difference was not statistically different (p?=?0.32). Based on Cox regression analysis initial wound volume influenced healing negatively (p?=?0.016) while smoking (p?=?0.011) was associated with faster wound healing. Significantly (p?<?0.01) more placebo (n?=?12) than zinc oxide-treated patients (n?=?3) needed antibiotics postoperatively. Although topical zinc oxide increased (p?<?0.001) wound fluid zinc levels (1830?±?405??M, mean?±?SEM) compared with placebo (3.1?±?1.6??M) serum-zinc levels did not differ significantly between the zinc (13.5?±?0.4??M) and placebo (12.8?±?0.4??m) groups on postoperative day 7. No adverse events were recorded. Topical zinc oxide treatment did not accelerate time to closure of open pilonidal wounds but was associated with reduced antibiotic usage.

AB  - Some male seasonal breeders are known to undergo testicular growth and regression throughout the year. The periodic and fast physiological development and regression processes, with simultaneous fast changes in blood flow, appears to be stimulated by angiogenic substances and inhibited by anti-angiogenic factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of season on microvascularization and production of angiogenic factors by testicular tissue, using the male cat as a model. Monthly, testes were collected post mortem from domestic stray cats, for histology and for tissue culture. Testis explants were cultured for 18h and conditioned media were tested for their ability to stimulate mitogenesis of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used as a positive control. Proliferative response of BAEC to samples was evaluated by determining the number of cells in each well using a Neubauer chamber. Vascular density was assessed by a computerized image analysis (?Scion Image, NIH, USA?) based on the total histological area occupied by the vascular lumen. Percentage data subjected to arcsine transformation were analysed by one-way ANOVA and post-comparison tests. There was a significant increase in microvascular areas in November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the remaining months (LSD test). All cat testicular tissue showed the capability to increase BAEC proliferation, when compared to negative controls, throughout the study. However, there was an increase in BAEC mitogenesis in February (P?<?0.05) and November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the other months. Our data show that cat testicular tissue from different periods of the year stimulates angiogenic factor(s). Furthermore, changes in angiogenesis may play a role on vascular growth and regression of the testes during the breeding and non-breeding season in the male cat.

AB  - Introduction:? Early excision and closure is standard for severe burn management. Cadaver skin is generally used as temporary coverage if autograft donor sites are inadequate. However, it is associated with an inherent risk of antigenicity and infection and has a limited shelf life and availability. Use of Integra?, a dermal substitute, is well established for postburn reconstruction, but its efficacy as primary coverage for severe burns it is not well documented. Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy of Integra? as an acute cover. Method:? Twenty children with >40 total body surface area (TBSA) burn, were randomized to be grafted with Integra? or with the autograft-allograft technique. Short-term outcome measures such as length of hospital stay, mortality, incidence of infection/sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic indexes were compared between and within groups before and after Integra?/graft application. Long-term outcome measures such as number of reconstructive procedures and blinded scar scoring were performed up to 2 years postinjury. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired t-test. Values are expressed as Mean?±?SEM and significance accepted at p?<?0.05. Results:? There were no significant differences between groups, in burn size (Controls 74?±?4% and Integra? 70?±?5%), mortality (Control 30%, Integra? 40%), length of hospital stay (Control 39?±?4 days, Integra? 41?±?4 days), and metabolic rates. In addition, there was no significant incidence of infection or sepsis in the Integra? group compared to controls. Long-term follow-up (Integra n?=?5, control n?=?5) revealed a significantly improved scar, in terms of height, thickness, vascularity, and maturity, in the Integra? group compared to the control group, at 12 months and 18?24 months postburn, (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Integra? can be safely used for immediate wound coverage in children with severe burns, with better functional and aesthetic outcomes up to 2 years postinjury.

AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - Background and purpose Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, but the cause remains unknown. Changes to the proteome prior to first symptom onset may reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Methods This preliminary study utilized pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic serum from a sample of 100 incident population-based US military veterans with MS along with 100 matched healthy controls. All samples were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Multidimensional protein identification technology tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on tryptic peptides of lectin-captured glycosylated serum proteins following albumin/immunoglobulin G depletion. Identified proteins were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program. Results The mean intervals between first symptom onset and the collection of pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic sera were ?6.0 and +1.1 years, respectively. Pre-symptomatic proteins from the MS group were differentially regulated compared with both control groups indicating that proteomic changes are detected prior to symptom onset. Pathway analysis showed that proteins involved in the complement and coagulation pathways and lipid transport are significantly altered in the serum of subjects with MS compared with healthy donors. Conclusions Compared with healthy controls, differential proteomic changes were noted in the serum of patients with MS that preceded the onset of symptomatic disease. Further work is in progress to confirm or refute these findings.

AB  - Summary Over the last few years, communication latency has been a major hurdle for most of the applications deployed in different network domains. During this era, a number of communication protocols and standards were developed and used by the community. However, still, the problem of latency persists keeping in view of the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for different applications. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the art proposals having tactile internet as a backbone for delay mitigation using 5G networks for future ultra-reliable low-latency applications such as Healthcare 4.0, Industry 4.0, virtual reality and augmented reality, and smart education. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that tactile internet can provide interactions between virtual objects to give a feel of real environment with maximum latency of 1 millisecond. Also, this paper highlights the key differences between the tactile internet and Internet of Things in context with 5G revolution. Then open issues and challenges of tactile internet for smart applications are analyzed. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented, which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison with its merits over the others.

AB  - Abstract Cell communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been defined for many years and it is not limited only to neighboring cells, but also distant ones in organisms receive these signals. These vesicles are secreted from the variety of cells and are composed of a distinctive component such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. EVs have different classified subgroups regarding their cell origin, in this context, exosomes are the most appealing particles in cell biology, especially clinical in recent years and are represented as novel therapeutic agents with numerous advantages alongside and/or over cell therapy. However, cell therapy had a hopeful outcome in gastrointestinal diseases which have minimal alternatives in their treatments. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal cancers are the examples that cell therapy and immunotherapy were applied in their treatment, therefore, the cell products like exosomes are the beneficial option in their treatment even cancers with promising results in animal models. In this review, we consider the main defined biogenesis, function, and component of secreted exosomes in different cells with a specific focus on the potential application of these exosomes as a cell-free therapeutic approach in gastrointestinal diseases like IBD, gastric cancer, and colon cancer. Additionally, exosomes role as therapeutic reagents mainly mesenchymal stem cells and dendritic cell-derived exosomes in different studies have been under intense investigation and even they are being studied in different clinical trials. Therefore, all these striking functions described for secretome implies the importance of these biocarriers.

AB  - Summary Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise to provide important new therapeutic approaches in treating age-associated diseases and other medical conditions due to their unique capacity for self-renewal, their pluripotency and their ability to differentiate into a broad variety of cell types. To date, numerous hESC lines have been developed and characterised. We discuss here how hESC lines are derived, their molecular and cellular properties, and how their ability to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers is determined. We highlight some of the challenges that must be overcome to obtain and evaluate therapeutic populations from hESCs and the strategies that are being developed to enable the use of hESC-derived cell populations in clinical applications. We conclude with a discussion of clinical trials that are beginning to provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of tissue-specific differentiated populations derived from human embryonic stem cells.
