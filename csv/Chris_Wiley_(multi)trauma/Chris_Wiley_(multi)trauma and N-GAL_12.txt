AB  - Abstract Aim The purposes of this study were to investigate senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) levels in articular cartilage of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the relationship with severity of the disease. Methods All the 50 cartilage tissues, including normal (controls) and OA cartilage were ascribed to four groups of normal, mild lesions, moderate lesions and severe lesions on the basis of the modified Mankin score. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the SA-beta-Gal expression in articular cartilage. Results No SA-beta-Gal staining was observed in the normal articular cartilage samples. SA-beta-Gal staining was found in a subset of the chondrocytes close to the lesion site of mild, moderate and severe damaged knee OA cartilage. The percentage of SA-beta-Gal-positive chondrocytes in articular cartilage was 0% in controls, 13.00 ± 5.77% in mild lesions, 31.65 ± 6.91% in moderate lesions and 51.95 ± 6.21% in severe lesions. SA-beta-Gal expression in mild lesions, moderate lesions and severe lesions was higher compared with that of controls (P < 0.0001). SA-beta-Gal expression in moderate lesions and severe lesions were higher with respect to mild lesion samples (P < 0.0001). SA-beta-Gal expression in severe lesions was elevated compared with those of moderate lesions (P < 0.0001). Subsequent analysis showed that articular cartilage SA-beta-Gal levels correlated with severity of disease (Spearman's ? = 0.94, P < 0.0001). Conclusion SA-beta-Gal expression in articular cartilage is associated with progressive knee OA joint damage and is a potential indictor of disease severity.

AB  - Abstract Garlic has a long history to be used for medicine and food purposes. Black garlic, the fermented product of fresh garlic, is considered with better biological activities, such as antioxidant activity, and is developed as an increasingly popular functional food. Polysaccharides are the major components of fresh and black garlic, and immunomodulatory activity is one major pharmacological effect of polysaccharides. Therefore, chemical characteristics and immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides from fresh and black garlic are investigated and compared in vitro for the 1st time, in order to reveal their molecular and pharmacological differences. It is demonstrated that the molecular weights of polysaccharides from the 2 sources and molar ratios of monosaccharides after acid hydrolysis are greatly variant. The effects of polysaccharides from 2 sources on RAW 264.7 macrophages functions, including promotion of phagocytosis, release of NO, and expressions of several immune-related cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma), were different from each other. The results indicated that fresh garlic polysaccharide exhibited stronger immunomodulatory activities than that of black garlic. Moreover, it is revealed that fructan might be the bioactive component in garlic and it is indicated that during the fermentation treatment, fructan constituents of garlic has degraded, and basically no immunomodulatory effect can be found in black garlic polysaccharides.

AB  - Background Our purpose was to assess the safety and tolerability of extended-release galantamine (GAL-ER), using a 1-week dose titration in Alzheimer's patients. Methods An open-label, 12-week, multicenter study was performed (n = 82). Results were compared with findings from a placebo-controlled trial using a 4-week titration of GAL-ER and immediate-release galantamine. The primary analysis compared incidences of adverse events (AEs). Results Although not statistically significant, more patients in the 1-week titration study experienced an AE. More patients with a 1-week titration had at least one prespecified gastrointestinal (GI) AE. These findings correlated with a higher baseline incidence of GI disturbances. Four patients experienced serious AEs; no deaths occurred. Mean Mini-Mental State Examination scores improved by 1.8 and 1.9 points at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. Conclusions A 1-week titration of GAL-ER was generally safe and well tolerated, with a potential risk of more GI side effects. A 1-week titration may permit dosing flexibility and promote increased adherence to medication regimens.

AB  - Abstract Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered a remarkable source for the regeneration of dental pulp tissues, but their therapeutic effectiveness remains limited, especially in elderly people. Previous studies found that senescence has a negative effect on the proliferation and differentiation potential of DPSCs. Moreover, numerous long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA were significantly differentially regulated in DPSCs from young and elderly donors. However, the changes in DPSCs protein during senescence have not been addressed. In this study, differences in DPSC protein expression profiles and coexpression of protein and lncRNA were analyzed using proteomics and bioinformatics. The results showed 75 upregulated proteins and 69 downregulated proteins in DPSCs from elderly donors. Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and protein export were the top four functional pathways associated with DPSCs. High mobility group N1 (HMGN1), HMGN2, UCHL1, and the family with sequence similarity 96 member B homeobox gene (FAM96B) were associated with DPSCs senescence. Then, we investigated FAM96B function in DPSCs. After FAM96B depletion, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activity decreased, but the number of senescence-associated ?-galactosidase (SA-?-gal) positive cells and the protein levels of p16, p53 were significantly increased. Gain-of-function assays suggested that FAM96B overexpression was positively correlated with TERT activity, but negatively correlated with the number of SA-?-gal positive cells and the protein levels of P16 and P53. Moreover, after FAM96B overexpression, the results showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and an enhanced mineralization ability of DPSCs. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction results also showed that dentin sialophosphoprotein and osteocalcin were expressed at greater levels. The carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) results displayed that FAM96B increased the proliferation potential of DPSCs. Our study revealed candidate proteins that might be related to DPSCs senescence and provided information to elucidate the mechanism of the biological changes in DPSCs' aging. Moreover, FAM96B was demonstrated to play an important role in suppressing DPSCs senescence and promoting osteogenic differentiation and proliferation.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and B vitamins deficiency are thought to be risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causality and independence of those associations are still questioned. Methods:?We measured fasting serum total homocysteine, folates, and vitamin B12 levels as well as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes in 467 patients hospitalized with a first well-documented deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism not related to a major acquired risk factor and 467 controls matched for gender and age. Results:?Mild hyperhomocysteinemia, low serum folates, and vitamin B12 were associated with VTE independently of each other. In multivariate analysis, odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) for VTE associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia (>15??mol?L?1), low serum folates (≤?4.9?nmol?L?1), and vitamin B12 (≤?253?pmol?L?1) were 1.48 (1.05?2.08), 3.14 (1.35?7.32) and 1.42 (1.03?1.98), respectively. An MTHFRC677T genotype was not significantly associated with VTE; OR (95% CI): 1.13 (0.70?1.81) Conclusions:?The current data provides further knowledge in the complex relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia, low vitamin levels, and VTE.

AB  - Abstract Fabry disease is an X-linked glycosphingolipid storage disorder resulting from deficiency of α-galactosidase A. Storage of globotriaosylceramide ultimately results in multiorgan pathology, including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and renal disease. Vascular involvement is evident throughout the body but the mechanisms by which storage on a cellular level leads to end-organ pathology are unknown. Here the evidence for abnormal blood flow, vessel architecture and endothelial function will be reviewed and possible models of vascular pathology discussed. The effects of reversal of storage within vessels by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and the possibilities for intervention with additional agents will be considered. Conclusion: The pathology of Fabry disease has an important vascular component, although the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Preliminary evidence suggests that ERT may have beneficial effects on the vascular component of this multisystem disease.
