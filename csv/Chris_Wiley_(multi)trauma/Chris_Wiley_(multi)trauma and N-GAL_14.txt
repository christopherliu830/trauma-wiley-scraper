AB  - Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male urogenital malignancy worldwide. Surgery, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the main clinical management options for PCa. However, these three therapies each have limitations. For example, surgery is not suitable for the advanced PCa patients with extensive metastases, and radiotherapy causes serious side effects. Primary endocrine therapy promotes the progression of hormone-sensitive PCa into the castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, considering these drawbacks, chemotherapy has become an effective and extensive treatment for PCa. Among the modern therapeutic strategies against advanced PCa, polymer-nanocarrier-incorporated formulations have gradually emerged due to their well-controlled release profiles and improved tumor targeting abilities. The drug delivery systems based on polymer nanoplatforms passively target tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Simultaneously, stimuli-responsive polymer nanoplatforms unload cargoes in response to certain stimuli in the tumor area. Furthermore, the active targeting ligand-conjugated polymer nanoformulations against PCa-specific markers have also achieved great success in PCa therapies. Herein, the advanced polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy are reviewed, while the future development of polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy is also predicted.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study investigated the frequency of traumatic experiences, prevalence rates of ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD), and overlap with ICD-10 classified disorders in outpatient psychiatry. Method Overall, 165 Danish psychiatric outpatients answered the International Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Event Checklist, and the World Health Organization Well-being Index. ICD-10 diagnoses were extracted from the hospital record. Chi-square analysis, t-tests, and conditional probability analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results Nearly all patients (94%) had experienced at least one traumatic event. CPTSD (36%) was more common than PTSD (8%) and had considerable overlap with ICD-10 affective, anxiety, PTSD, personality, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. ICD-11 PTSD overlapped with ICD-10 anxiety, PTSD, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. A subgroup of patients with ICD-10 PTSD (23 %) did not meet criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. Conclusion Traumatic experiences are common. ICD-11 CPTSD is a highly prevalent disorder in psychiatric outpatients. One quarter with ICD-10 PTSD did not meet criteria for either ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. PTSD and CPTSD had considerable overlap with ICD-10 disorders.

AB  - Abstract JS 3/16, derived from passaged oligodendroglial cultures prepared from rat cerebral white matter, differentiate from progenitors (OP) into complex process-bearing, galactocerebroside-positive but myelin basic protein-negative immature oligodendrocyte-like cells (ImO) after withdrawal of trophic factors. We found that JS 3/16 ImO are markedly more susceptible than OP to cell death after sustained α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate glutamate receptor (AMPA-GluR) activation. This excitotoxicity is preceded by loss of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, which is more marked in ImO than OP. We identified three factors likely to contribute to the diminished Ca2+ homeostatic capacity of ImO. First, signal intensities of immunoreactive GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4 AMPA-GluR subunits are increased 1.3- to 2.2-fold in ImO over OP without comparable changes in RNA editing and alternative splicing. Second, transcriptional levels of genes encoding Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins and a plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA1), which are necessary for Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane, are lower in ImO than in OP. Third, ImO have more depolarized basal mitochondrial membrane potential (??) than OP, and ?? collapses within 15 min after onset of AMPA-GluR activation in almost all ImO, but not in the majority of OP. This ?? collapse limits the capacity of ImO mitochondria to buffer the rise in intracellular Ca2+ caused by AMPA-GluR activation. The JS 3/16 line provides a valuable system for analysis of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and AMPA-GluR-mediated excitotoxicity in the oligodendroglial lineage.

AB  - Objective To determine corticosteroid treatment effectiveness in patients with oral lichen planus/oral lichenoid lesions (OLP/OLL). Material and Methods Twenty-one patients with OLP and eighty-one patients with OLL received 0.05% clobetasol propionate (CP) or 0.05% triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in aqueous solution (AS) or orabase (OB), evaluating responses to treatment and follow-up compliance. Results Lesions were atrophic (72 of 102; 70.6%), extensive (58 of 100; 58%), producing eating difficulties (62 of 102; 60.8%), and spontaneous pain (30 of 102; 29.4%); 50 patients (49%) received CP-AS. The mean ± SD percentage of follow-ups attended was 43 ± 32%. Symptom remission was achieved in 46% of patients receiving CP-AS, 36.36% of those receiving TA-AS, 20% of those receiving CP-OB, and 25% of those receiving TA-OB. Follow-up compliance was poor in 66.7% of patients. Among 51 patients with continuous symptoms, 64.7% evidenced total remission at treatment completion; among 33 with intermittent symptoms, 73.1% had outbreaks 2?3 times/year and 51.5% controlled outbreaks with <6 corticosteroid applications. Adverse effects were observed in seven patients (6.8%) (moon face, hirsutism, capillary fragility) in induction stage, subsiding with dose; among 15 patients under maintenance treatment for >6 months, one showed hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis inhibition but not adrenal insufficiency. Conclusions Our treatment proved highly effective and safe. Recall programs are desirable to enhance follow-up compliance.
