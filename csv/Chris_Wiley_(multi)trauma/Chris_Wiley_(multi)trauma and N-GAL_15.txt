AB  - Abstract Background Endosulfan is not a restricted use organochlorine insecticide and is currently under re-registration review. In 1993, one confirmed case and one possible case of endosulfan poisoning in agricultural workers occurred in two southeastern states. Methods Two cases of suspected endosulfan poisoning were investigated utilizing record reviews, blood samples, a site visit, and clothing analysis. Results Case 1 was fatal; Case 2 resulted in permanent neurological impairment. Additionally, Case 1 mixed and applied two less toxic pesticides, acephate and maleic hydrazide to tobacco plants. Both farm owners had ample opportunity for endosulfan exposure while mixing concentrated endosulfan with water and applying the solution to tobacco with boom sprayers pulled by tractors. Conclusions Estimates of the absorbed dose of endosulfan were not available because methods to determine actual personal exposure that would be found in fat or tissue samples were not used. Health and safety issues associated with endosulfan require a closer examination. A cooperative multi-disciplinary approach to providing timely accurate education is needed to prevent pesticide poisonings. Am. J. Ind. Med. 39:643?649, 2001. ? 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The anatomy of the olfactory system is highly complex, comprising a system of olfactory receptors, pathways for the transmission of olfactory information, and structures for the recognition, discrimination, and memorization of odors. During the last years, proteomics has emerged as a large-scale comprehensive approach to characterize and quantify specific olfactory-related proteomes in different biological conditions such as olfactory learning, neurodegeneration, and ageing between others. The current work reviews recent applications of proteomics to olfaction with particular focus on quantitative proteome profiling studies performed on olfactory areas from laboratory animal models as well as proteomic characterizations performed on specific brain structures and fluids involved in human smell. Finally, we will also discuss the potential application of proteomics to study global proteome dynamics and posttranslationally modified proteomes in order to unravel cell-signaling networks that occur from peripheral structures to olfactory cortical areas during odor processing.

AB  - Summary In recent years, topically applied semi-solid formulations certified as medicals devices and not as topical drugs are increasingly used for the treatment of skin diseases. Medical devices primarily unfold their therapeutic effect by physical means, not by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means. Intensified placing of medical devices on the dermatological market may at least partly be explained by a less complex marketing authorization process compared to topical drugs. If the requirements are fulfilled to certify a product as a medical device the opportunity will be offered to quickly introduce innovations onto the market and propagate them. A variety of evidence-based medical devices for several dermatological indications are presented here.

AB  - Summary In vivo and in vitro studies in the cellular and molecular signaling activations on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights into their potential clinical applications, particularly for tissue repair and regeneration. This review focuses on these advances, specifically in the context of characterizing MSCs and self-renewal for tissue repair and recovery after diseases. MSCs have been extensively characterized and demonstrated mitigation and therapy on different diseases in human clinical cases and experimental animal models. MSC-based technologies for treating diseases alone or in combination with adjuvants are foreseeable. Current challenges in MSC therapy are the need to overcome cell purity, bioengineering difficulties for tissue structures, optimization of MSC administration protocols, termination of MSC activation after repair and regeneration accomplished, and safety of long-term presence of MSCs in the body.

AB  - The ABH and Lewis antigens were among the first of the human red blood cell polymorphisms to be identified and, in the case of the former, play a dominant role in transfusion and transplantation. But these two therapies are largely twentieth-century innovations, and the ABH and related carbohydrate antigens are not only expressed on a very wide range of human tissues, but were present in primates long before modern humans evolved. Although we have learned a great deal about the biochemistry and genetics of these structures, the biological roles that they play in human health and disease are incompletely understood. This review and its companion, which appeared in a previous issue of Vox Sanguinis, will focus on a few of the biologic and pathologic processes which appear to be affected by histo-blood group phenotype. The first of the two reviews explored the interactions of two bacteria with the ABH and Lewis glycoconjugates of their human host cells, and described the possible connections between the immune response of the human host to infection and the development of the AB-isoagglutinins. This second review will describe the relationship between ABO phenotype and thromboembolic disease, cardiovascular disease states, and general metabolism.
