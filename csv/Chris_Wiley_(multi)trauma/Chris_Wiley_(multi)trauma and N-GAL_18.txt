AB  - Abstract Inflammasomes are a specialized group of intracellular sensors that are key components of the host innate immune system. Autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of the innate immune system that are characterized by recurrent inflammation and serious complications. Dysregulation of the inflammasome is associated with the onset and progression of several autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we discuss the involvement of various inflammasome components in the regulation of autoinflammatory disorders and describe the manifestations of these autoinflammatory diseases caused by inflammasome activation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Glycosylation of acute-phase proteins (APP), which is partially regulated by cytokines, may be distinct in disease and provide useful tumour markers. Thus, we have examined the glycosylation of major serum APP in pancreatic cancer (PaC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and control patients. Experimental design: Using a specific anti-sialyl Lewis X antibody and N-glycan sequencing, we have determined glycosylation changes on α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin (HPT), fetuin (FET), α-1-antitrypsin (AT) and transferrin (TRF). Results: Increased levels of sialyl Lewis X (SLex) were detected on AGP in advanced PaC and CP and on HPT, FET, AT and TRF in CP. An increase in N-glycan branching was detected on AGP and HPT in the advanced stage of PaC and CP and on FET and TRF in the CP. A core fucosylated structure was increased on AGP and HPT only in the advanced PaC patients. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Changes in APP SLex and branching are probably associated with an inflammatory response because they were detected in both advanced PaC and CP patients and these conditions give rise to inflammation. On the contrary, the increase in APP core fucosylation could be cancer associated and the presence of this glycoform may give an advantage to the tumour.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process, which is not yet completely understood. Satellite cells, the skeletal muscle stem cells, become activated after trauma, proliferate, and migrate to the site of injury. Depending on the severity of the myotrauma, activated satellite cells form new multinucleated myofibers or fuse to damaged myofibers. The specific microenvironment of the satellite cells, the niche, controls their behavior. The niche contains several components that maintain satellite cells quiescence until they are activated. In addition, a great diversity of stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-?1 regulate their activity. Donor-derived satellite cells are able to improve muscle regeneration, but their migration through the muscle tissue and across endothelial layers is limited. Less than 1% of their progeny, the myoblasts, survive the first days upon intra-muscular injection. However, a range of other multipotent muscle- and non-muscle-derived stem cells are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. These stem cells can occupy the satellite cell niche and show great potential for the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the niche factors, growth factors, and other stem cells, which are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Knowledge about the factors regulating satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle regeneration can be used to improve the treatment of muscle injuries and diseases. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary Toxic, nutritional and metabolic derangements can cause damage to the nervous system by a variety of mechanisms and lead to a wide spectrum of characteristic neurological disorders. This chapter includes a review of the effects of accidental and deliberate exposure to industrial and environmental toxins and drugs of addiction including alcohol. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) occurs in the liver and ovaries of puffer fish, toad fish and some types of crabs. Exposure to radiation occurs naturally but this is low intensity and carries few risks. Direct high pressure injury to the CNS leads to a progressive rest or intention tremor, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia and transient cognitive and memory disturbance. Alcohol abuse is extremely common and is associated with important cultural, economic and environmental influences and consequences. The chapter presents neurological disease seen in adult patients with inherited disorders of metabolism. It discusses the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, investigation and management of adult onset leukodystrophy.

AB  - Abstract Carbohydrates have emerged as a significant new approach to drug discovery. The impact can be seen in the carbohydrate-based therapeutics recently approved for marketing. For example, the trend with low molecular weight heparin-based products has culminated in the approval of a synthetic pentasaccharide for preventing venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery. Also, in the treatment of viral infection, two monosaccharide glycomimetic drugs that block neuraminidase are now available for the treatment of influenza. Indeed, at least two new carbohydrate-based drugs were approved on an annual basis as therapeutics during the last decade. Considering the carbohydrate therapeutics now in development, this pace should continue. To continue long term, several objectives must be reached. Technologies to supply carbohydrates in quality and quantity must be refined or discovered. This includes any combination of automated, solid and solution phase, and enzymatic synthesis. Work demonstrating that carbohydrate multivalency is a successful approach to drug discovery needs to be done. Likewise, examples that illustrate how carbohydrate-based libraries can accelerate drug discovery are also needed. An important factor for the success of carbohydrate-based therapeutics in the last decade is the combination of glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry.
