AB  - Abstract The carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) deficiency syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that produces osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and cerebral calcification. Other features include developmental delay, short stature, cognitive defects, and a history of multiple fractures by adolescence. With one exception, all patients with osteopetrosis and renal tubular acidosis examined have proven to have CA II deficiency. All CA II-deficient patients analyzed have been found to have mutations in the CA2 gene. Previously, we used single strand conformational (SSCP) analysis to identify exons to be sequenced from CA II-deficient patients. In this report, we amplified all seven exons by PCR from genomic DNA and directly sequenced the amplified products. Application of this method allowed identification of eleven new mutations in 21 patients referred for confirmation of the diagnosis of CA II deficiency. These mutations were scattered over the genome from exon 2 to 7. In two opportunities for prenatal diagnosis, one from cultured amniocytes and one from chorionic villus biopsy, we demonstrated the general utility of the direct sequencing method for prenatal DNA diagnosis. These studies expand our knowledge of the heterogeneity in mutations underlying the CA II deficiency syndrome. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) is a rare clinical entity characterized by disease onset before the age of 21. JHD accounts for <10% of Huntington disease patients. Transmission of JHD is paternal in 80?90% of cases. Patients with JHD usually carry more than 60 CAG repeats within the HTT gene. We report here on a 23-month-old boy presenting with global developmental delay first noted at 18 months of age. Clinical examination showed truncal hypotonia, postural and intentional tremor, limb rigidity, and ataxia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) showed reduced cerebellar volume. Six months later, his 47-year-old father was seen for a 4-year history of progressive dementia with severe behavioral disturbance and chorea. Cerebral MRI showed discrete global and caudate atrophy. DNA analysis revealed a very large and heterogeneous expansion (210?250 CAG) in the child and a 43 CAG expansion of the HTT gene in the father. This unusual case demonstrates that very early onset JHD due to large CAG expansions should be considered in cases of global developmental delay associated with reduced cerebellar volume, including cases without known HD family history. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a group of diseases characterized by a persistent elevation of phenylalanine levels in tissues and biological fluids. The most frequent form is phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, causing phenylketonuria (PKU). Among 159 Israeli patients (Jews, Muslim and Christian Arabs and Druze) with HPA, in whom at least one of the mutations was characterized, a total of 43 different mutations were detected, including seven novel ones. PKU was very rare among Ashkenazi Jews and relatively frequent among Jews from Yemen, the Caucasian Mountains, Bukhara and Tunisia. The mutations responsible for the high frequency were: exon3del (Yemenite Jews), L48S (Tunisian Jews) and E178G, P281L and L48S (Jews from the Caucasian Mountains and Bukhara). Among the non-Jewish Israeli citizens, the disease was relatively frequent in the Negev and in the Nazareth vicinity, and in many localities a unique mutation was detected, often in a single family. While marked genetic heterogeneity was observed in the Arab and Jewish populations, only one mutation A300S, was frequent in all of the communities. Several of the other frequent mutations were shared by the non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs; none were mutual to Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs.

AB  - Summary Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes various human diseases, including blindness caused by ocular infection and sexually transmitted diseases resulting from urogenital infection. After infecting host cells, Chlamydiae avoid alarming the host's immune system. Among the immune evasion mechanisms, Chlamydiae can inhibit NF-?B activation, a crucial pathway for host inflammatory responses. In this study, we show that ChlaDub1, a deubiquitinating and deNeddylating protease from C.?trachomatis, is expressed in infected cells. In transfection experiments, ChlaDub1 suppresses NF-?B activation induced by several pro-inflammatory stimuli and binds the NF-?B inhibitory subunit I?Bα, impairing its ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, we provide further insight into the mechanism by which C.?trachomatis may evade the host inflammatory response by demonstrating that ChlaDub1, a protease produced by this microorganism, is capable of inhibiting I?Bα degradation and blocking NF-?B activation.

AB  - Summary Thirty-three pairs of pigs were fed from 25 to 95 kg live weight on a ration of the same composition but distributed in a different way. The weekly amount being equal, the partitioning occured over 6 (treatment A) or 7 days (treatment B). There were 2 meals per day and the feed was distributed in a wet form. Weight gain, feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and carcass composition were measured. At the end of the experiment serum insulin levels were recorded following the ingestion of an equal amount of feed in the 2 treatment groups. The zootechnical performances were in both sexes less favourable on the A-treatment. In females, daily weight gain, FCE and dressing percentage were significantly reduced; in barrows, fat/meat ratio and the calculated protein and fat (ether-extract) contents of the carcass indicated significantly fatter carcasses, despite the identical amount of ingested feed over the whole experimental period. The level of circulating insulin, 90 minutes after feed ingestion, fell significantly more in the pigs (barrows as well as females) on the B treatment. This was brought in connection with the difference in carcass composition of the 2 treatments. It is suggested that other factors as presentation of the feed, race and sex may also influence the feed intake pattern and consequently induce hormonal adaptations, which result in changes in lipogenesis. Zusammenfassung Der Einfluß der quantitativen Futterzuteilung auf Gewichtszunahme, Schlachtkörperzusammensetzung und Seruminsulinspiegel beim Schwein Es wurden Versuche mit 66 Schweinen, eingeteilt in zwei Gruppen, je 33 kastrierte Eber und 33 Sauen, im Gewichtsbereich von 25?95 kg, durchgeführt. Die Schweine erhielten das gleiche Futter. Die wöchentlich zugeteilte Futtermenge war ebenfalls gleich, allerdings in Gruppe A über sechs Tage und in der Gruppe B über sieben Tage ? bei täglich zwei Mahlzeiten ? angeboten. Als Meßkriterien dienten die Gewichtsentwicklung, die Futterverwertung und die Schlachtkörperzusammensetzung. Ferner wurde am Ende des Versuches die Seruminsulinkonzentration bis 90 Minuten nach der Einnahme einer für beide Gruppen gleichen Futtermenge gemessen. Die Sauen der Gruppe A zeigten eine signifikant schlechtere Gewichtszunahme, Futterverwertung und Schlachtausbeute. Die Kastraten der Gruppe A wiesen ein schlechteres Fleisch-Fett-Verhältnis auf und der berechnete Eiweiß-Fettgehalt im Schlachtkörper lag in der Gruppe A schlechter als in Gruppe B. Die Seruminsulin-konzentration 90 Minuten nach der Mahlzeit lag bei der Gruppe B signifikant niedriger als bei der Gruppe A. Diese Differenz in der Insulinsekretion wird mit der unterschiedlichen Körperzusammensetzung der beiden Gruppen in Zusammenhang gebracht. In der Diskussion wird darauf hingewiesen, daß weitere Faktoren wie Struktur des Futters (Pellets oder Mehl), Rasse und Geschlecht der Tiere die Futteraufnahme beeinflussen und deshalb die hormonale Adaptation beeinflussen können, woraus eine Veränderung der Lipogenese resultieren kann.

AB  - Abstract We report the study of binuclear LnIII chelates of OHEC (OHEC=octaazacyclohexacosane-1,4,7,10,14,17,20,23-octaacetate). The interconversion between two isomeric forms, which occurs in aqueous solution, has been studied by NMR, UV/Vis, EPR, and luminescence spectroscopy, as well as by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the first time we have characterized an isomerization equilibrium for a LnIII polyaminocarboxylate complex (LnIII=Y, Eu, Gd and Tb) in which the metal centre changes its coordination number from nine to eight, such that: [Ln2(ohec)(H2O)2]2??[Ln2(ohec)]2?+2?H2O. The variable temperature and pressure NMR measurements conducted on this isomerization reaction give the following thermodynamic parameters for EuIII: K298=0.42±0.01, ?H0=+4.0±0.2 kJ?mol?1, ?S0=+6.1±0.5 J?K?1?mol?1 and ?V0=+3.2±0.2 cm3?mol?1. The isomerization is slow and the corresponding kinetic parameters obtained by NMR spectroscopy are: k${{298\hfill \atop {\rm is}\hfill}}$=73.0±0.5 s?1, ?H${{{\ne}\hfill \atop {\rm is}\hfill}}$=75.3±1.9 kJ?mol?1, ?S${{{\ne}\hfill \atop {\rm is}\hfill}}$=+43.1±5.8 J?K?1?mol?1 and ?V${{{\ne}\hfill \atop {\rm is}\hfill}}$=+7.9±0.7 cm3?mol?1. Variable temperature and pressure 17O NMR studies have shown that water exchange in [Gd2(ohec)(H2O)2]2? is slow, k${{298\hfill \atop {\rm ex}\hfill}}$=(0.40±0.02)?106 s?1, and that it proceeds through a dissociative interchange Id mechanism, ?V?=+7.3±0.3 cm3?mol?1. The anisotropy of this oblong binuclear complex has been highlighted by MD simulation calculations of different rotational correlation times. The rotational correlation time directed on the Gd?Gd axis is 24?% longer than those based on the axes orthogonal to the Gd?Gd axis. The relaxivity of this binuclear complex has been found to be low, since 1) only [Gd2(ohec)(H2O)2]2?, which constitutes 70?% of the binuclear complex, contributes to the inner-sphere relaxivity and 2) the anisotropy of the complex prevents water molecules from having complete access to both GdIII cages; this decreases the outer-sphere relaxivity. Moreover, EPR measurements for the GdIII and for the mixed GdIII/YIII binuclear complexes have clearly shown that the two GdIII centres interact intramolecularly; this enhances the electronic relaxation of the GdIII electron spins.

AB  - Summary Pantoea agglomerans, a widespread epiphytic bacterium, has evolved into a hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp)-dependent and host-specific gall-forming pathogen by the acquisition of a pathogenicity plasmid containing a type III secretion system (T3SS) and its effectors (T3Es). Pantoea agglomerans pv. betae (Pab) elicits galls on beet (Beta vulgaris) and gypsophila (Gypsophila paniculata), whereas P. agglomerans pv. gypsophilae (Pag) incites galls on gypsophila and a hypersensitive response (HR) on beet. Draft genome sequences were generated and employed in combination with a machine-learning approach and a translocation assay into beet roots to identify the pools of T3Es in the two pathovars. The genomes of the sequenced Pab4188 and Pag824-1 strains have a similar size (?5 MB) and GC content (?55%). Mutational analysis revealed that, in Pab4188, eight T3Es (HsvB, HsvG, PseB, DspA/E, HopAY1, HopX2, HopAF1 and HrpK) contribute to pathogenicity on beet and gypsophila. In Pag824-1, nine T3Es (HsvG, HsvB, PthG, DspA/E, HopAY1, HopD1, HopX2, HopAF1 and HrpK) contribute to pathogenicity on gypsophila, whereas the PthG effector triggers HR on beet. HsvB, HsvG, PthG and PseB appear to endow pathovar specificities to Pab and Pag, and no homologous T3Es were identified for these proteins in other phytopathogenic bacteria. Conversely, the remaining T3Es contribute to the virulence of both pathovars, and homologous T3Es were found in other phytopathogenic bacteria. Remarkably, HsvG and HsvB, which act as host-specific transcription factors, displayed the largest contribution to disease development.

AB  - ABSTRACT Pediococcus pentosaceous DT10, isolated from ready-to-eat fish products, produced a bacteriocin active against Gram-positive bacteria, many of which are associated with food spoilage and food-related health hazards. The bacteriocin, named pediocin DT10, was partially purified and was observed to kill sensitive Leuconostoc mesenteroides cells by acting on their cytoplasmic membrane. Exposure of cell suspensions of L. mesenteroides to pediocin DT10 produced cell-viability loss, as shown by the reduction in colony-forming units after treatment. The activity of pediocin DT10 against L. mesenteroides cells was bactericidal in nature, and also induced an important efflux of intracellular material. The transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of L. mesenteroides cells confirmed the way pediocin DT10 causes lysis of the sensitive L. mesenteroides cells.

AB  - Abstract Primary cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells were transformed, in vitro, by exposure to Rous sarcoma virus. Transformed cells were followed and evaluated cytogenetically through numerous passages. Highly specific karyotypic changes in karyotype (both structural and numerical) were documented. These changes became established and intimately involved in further ?karyotypic evolution?. The findings were reproducible, and when considered in the light of the literature suggest regular patterns of karyotypic change in rat tumors. The in vitro methodology utilized promises to be of practical value in the study of the early stages of malignancy.

AB  - Abstract The ultrastructure of Langerhans cells has not been fully investigated in diabetes-associated gingival tissues. The present study was carried out to investigate the ultrastructure of gingival Langerhans cells in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Gingival biopsies were obtained from 22 diabetic and 18 control rats. Langerhans cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the basal layers of healthy oral epithelium. On rare occasions, Langerhans cells were found in the suprabasal layers of the oral epithelium. Langerhans cells in the oral epithelium of diabetic rats were seen in the basal and suprabasal layers. Usually, Langerhans cells had clear cytoplasm and convoluted or indented nuclei and few or no specific granules. The clear cytoplasm contained mitochondria, lysosomes and a small number of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum regions, but it lacked tonofilament. Occasionally, centrioles were also observed in the cytoplasm. The membrane of Langerhans cells had no junctional complexes such as desmosomes. In diabetic rats, Langerhans cell precursors were developed into specific granule-bearing cells. Both Langerhans cells and their granules were more frequent in the gingiva of diabetic rats than in the control group. These data suggest that Langerhans cells play an important role in explaining the pathogenesis and development of diabetic gingivitis. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Non-native tree plantations constitute a large part of forestation worldwide. Plantations are prone to invasion by exotic herbaceous plant species due to habitat properties, including understory vegetation structure. We established 40 sampling sites in 10 plantation forests. Sites were selected according to tree species (native poplar forests and exotic pine plantations) and common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) density (invaded and non-invaded sites) in a full factorial design. We collected spiders with pitfall traps. We found a significant effect of A. syriaca invasion on spider functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy), with invaded sites having a lower functional diversity than non-invaded sites. A larger effect of invasion with A. syriaca on the RaoQ of spiders was observed in pine compared to poplar plantations. Spider species were larger, and web-building spiders were more frequent in poplar forests than in pine plantations. We found no effect of A. syriaca invasion on species richness or abundance of spiders. Species composition of spider assemblages in the two forest types was clearly separated according to non-metric multidimensional scaling. We identified seven species associated with pine plantations and six species associated with poplar plantations. The similar species richness and the higher functional diversity of non-invaded sites suggested that these trait states were less similar than invaded sites and that functionally different species were present. In contrast, the invaded sites had lower functional diversities and thus more uniform trait state compositions, suggesting that environmental filtering played an important role in species sorting, making invaded plantations low-quality secondary habitats for the original spider fauna.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of asthma management is to achieve and maintain clinical control. Control data for children is sparse. Objective This analysis evaluated factors associated with not achieving well-controlled (WC) asthma using data from a study in 548 children with uncontrolled asthma. Methods Post hoc analysis of factors affecting the probability of not achieving WC asthma in children receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/100?µg bd (SFC) or montelukast 5?mg od (MON), included: reasons for patients failing the asthma control criteria; achievement of overall asthma control; time course of improvement in individual outcomes and composite score; factors associated with not achieving WC asthma. Results The proportion of patients failing individual control criteria at baseline was: ?2-agonist rescue use: 96%, peak expiratory flow (PEF): 91%, symptoms: 78%, and night-time awakenings: 66%. Most patients failed the composite control score for more than one reason with 482 (99%), 387 (80%), and 249 (52%) failing 2, 3, or 4 control criteria, respectively. Overall asthma control was achieved by 166 (59%) patients in the SFC group and 96 (36%) in the MON group (P?<?0.001). Time course of control differed between individual control components with symptoms responding most rapidly and PEF most slowly. Factors significantly influencing the probability of not achieving WC asthma were treatment with MON, country, and night-time awakenings at baseline, treatment being the most important. Conclusion Different outcomes improve at different rates. Assessment of one or a few outcomes over-estimates the level of asthma control. An overall composite score in combination with the proportion of patients failing on three or more criteria seemed to most accurately reflect the level of control. Compared with SFC treatment, MON was three times less likely to result in good asthma control. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011; 46: 1182?1188. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary The effects of halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane anaesthesia on hepatic function and hepatocellular damage were investigated in dogs, comparing the activity of hepatic enzymes and bilirubin concentration in serum. An experimental study was designed. Twenty-one clinically normal mongrel dogs were divided into three groups and accordingly anaesthetized with halothane (n?=?7), isoflurane (n?=?7) and sevoflurane (n?=?7). The dogs were 1?4?years old, and weighed between 13.5 and 27?kg (18.4?±?3.9). Xylazine HCI (1?2?mg/kg) i.m. was used as pre-anaesthetic medication. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2?mg/kg i.v. The trachea was intubated and anaesthesia maintained with halothane, isoflurane or sevoflurane in oxygen at concentrations of 1.35, 2 and 3%, respectively. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (tidal volume, 15?ml/kg; respiration rate, 12?14/min) was started immediately after intubation and the anaesthesia lasted for 60?min. Venous blood samples were collected before pre-medication, 24 and 48?h, and 7 and 14?days after anaesthesia. Serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH GGT) activities and bilirubin concentration were measured. Serum AST, ALT and GGT activities increased after anaesthesia in all groups. In the halothane group, serum AST and ALT activities significantly increased all the time after anaesthesia compared with baseline activities. But in the isoflurane group AST and ALT activities increased only between 2 and 7?days, and in the sevoflurane group 7?days after anaesthesia. GGT activity was increased in the halothane group between 2 and 7?days, and in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups 7?days after anaesthesia. All dogs recovered from anaesthesia without complications and none developed clinical signs of hepatic damage within 14?days. The results suggest that the use of halothane anaesthesia induces an elevation of serum activities of liver enzymes more frequently than isoflurane or sevoflurane from 2 to 14?days after anaesthesia in dogs. The effects of isoflurane or sevoflurane anaesthesia on the liver in dogs is safer than halothane anaesthesia in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Five doses of daclizumab, given initially after kidney transplantation, reduce the rate of acute rejection (AR). Without cyclosporin A (CsA), a protocol, including daclizumab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids (CSs), has recently shown efficacy in terms of graft function and survival. The rate of AR was relatively high, however. In this single-centre study, a CsA low-dose regimen was combined with two doses of daclizumab (1?mg/kg day 0 and 14), plus MMF (2?g) and CS. Forty-three cadaver donor renal recipients were included. Following the onset of graft function, target trough levels of CsA were 150?200?ng/ml for 90 days, then 100?150?ng/ml. One year AR rate was 23% (n?=?10) and events occurred at a median of 2.9 months (range from 9 days to 9.6 months). Delayed graft function (DGF) (absent spontaneous reduction of serum creatinine day 1) was 51%. Graft survival was 95% and patient survival 98% after 1 year. With respect to our previous experience, we used CsA, azathioprine and CSs (n?=?223) from 1988 to 1995, and the rate of AR was 57%. From 1996 to 1998, standard CsA doses, MMF and CS (n?=?67) resulted in 31% AR. Median time to AR was 0.8 and 1.0 month, and the rate of DGF was 20 and 22%, respectively. This CsA low-dose protocol, including two doses of daclizumab, MMF and CS, resulted in a reduction and delay of AR episodes and excellent graft function, graft survival and patient survival, despite an increase in DGF.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Antipsychotic medications play a significant role in the treatment and recovery of people with several psychiatric disorders. However, research findings indicate mental health nurses are insufficiently knowledgeable about antipsychotic medication side effects. Aim To assess practising mental health nurses? knowledge of antipsychotic medication side effects using a Multiple-Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) across National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England. Hypothesis Knowledge of antipsychotic medication side effects amongst registered mental health nurses is related to their academic qualification, clinical banding and length of experience. Method A national survey of registered mental health nurses was carried out using an online questionnaire which was disseminated by Research and Development departments. Results 504 questionnaires were returned, 245 of which had full data and further analysed. The mean score for the sample was 14.4 and only 21 participants attained a mark of >80%. Implications for Practice Two out of three of our hypotheses (that length of experience and clinical banding are directly related to knowledge of antipsychotic medication side effects) were supported. Our study found many nurses have a suboptimal working knowledge of antipsychotic medication side effects which has the potential to compromise care. Strategies need to be put in place to enhance pharmacology knowledge.
