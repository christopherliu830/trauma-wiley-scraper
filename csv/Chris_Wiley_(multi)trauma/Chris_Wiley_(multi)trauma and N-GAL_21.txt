AB  - Summary Over the years, the role of biochemical, immunological, genetic, and other biological aspects in the pathogenesis of vitiligo has been studied. So far, no convincing model describing the interplay of these contributing factors has been formulated. Based on existing research, we propose that vitiligo has a multi-factorial etiology, characterized by multiple steps, but always involving an increase of external or internal phenol/catechol concentration, serving as a preferred surrogate substrate of tyrosinase, competing with its physiological substrate tyrosine. The conversion of these substrates into reactive quinones is reinforced by a disturbed redox balance (increasing hydrogen peroxide). Such reactive quinones can be covalently bound to the catalytic centre of tyrosinase (haptenation). This could give rise to a new antigen, carried by Langerhans cells to the regional lymph node, stimulating the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. However, the activation of such cytotoxic cells is only a first step in skin melanocyte killing, which also depends on a shift in the balance between immune defence and tolerance, e.g. resulting from a decrease in properly functioning T-regulatory cells. With this new model, based on a synthesis of several of the existing theories, in mind, the external and internal factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of vitiligo are reviewed, against the background of reported clinical data, experimental studies and existing and potential new therapies. A similar complex mechanism may also lead to some other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Abstract In recent months, neural fetal retina has been transplanted into blind human patients affected by Retinitis Pigmentosa. Initial success, as documented by improved visual activity, has been reported (del Cerro et al., Neuroscience Abstract, 1996). With the rapid progress in human patients, additional questions are arising concerning transplantation issues. Additional answers and further success in treating clinical disease will necessarily come from new laboratory research in animal models as well as in vitro systems. This increases the need for evaluation of the data already gathered over the first decade of retinal transplantation. The extensive experimental background work that preceded the current wave of human retinal transplants is reviewed in this paper, with particular emphasis given to the work dealing with the transplantation of neural retina.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.
