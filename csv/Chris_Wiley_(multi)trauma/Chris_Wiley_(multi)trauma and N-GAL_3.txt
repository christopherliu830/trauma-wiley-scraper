AB  - Key content Injury of the urinary tract is the most common major complication of gynaecological laparoscopic surgery. Injury to either bladder or ureter results in significant morbidity for the patient and may lead to litigation. Knowledge of pelvic anatomy, training and meticulous technique are of paramount importance in reducing the incidence of urinary tract injury. Ideally an injury should be identified and repaired during the primary operation, but vigilance in the immediate postoperative period may result in early recognition and intervention. Learning objectives To understand the common risk factors of urinary tract injury at laparoscopy. To learn strategies to prevent injury where possible. To learn strategies for intraoperative and postoperative recognition and repair of such injuries. To understand the significance of multi-disciplinary management of such injuries. Ethical issues Limited evidence shows that laparoscopic hysterectomy may carry a higher risk of urinary tract injury compared with abdominal hysterectomy. Should patients be counselled accordingly?

AB  - Abstract Objective? Intra-operative colonic lavage is a widespread procedure introduced to decompress and clean the colon of its faecal load during emergency surgery of the left colon in order to perform a safe anastomosis. This type of lavage is never performed at our institution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and acceptability of emergency left-sided colectomy without colonic lavage in a consecutive series of patients admitted at our department for perforation and obstruction of the left colon. Patients and methods? All 44 patients (29 with obstruction and 15 with perforation) on whom a one-stage left-sided colon resection was performed without colonic lavage between January 1998 and June 2004 were evaluated in a retrospective review. During this period all patients with acute disease of the left colon underwent a one stage resection without colonic lavage. The only exclusion criteria for anastomosis were: haemodynamic instability, ASA?>?3, unresectable tumour. Death, anastomotic leakage and wound infection were main outcome measures. Result? The leak rate was 4.5% and mortality 2.3% due to one case of postoperative myocardial infarction. A 16% morbidity rate was recorded due to 4 wound infections and 3 minor complications. Conclusion? The procedure is safe. The low morbidity and mortality of one stage resection without colonic lavage can justify future prospective studies enrolling a large number of patients to compare its results with those obtained by one stage resection with colonic lavage.

AB  - The spectrin role(s) is (are) very important for the shape and the physical properties of red cells, such as deformability and resistance to mechanical stresses. Moreover a variety of spectrin diseases are known. We have previously demonstrated [Corsi, D., Galluzzi, L., Crinelli, R. & Magnani, M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 8928?8935] that human erythroid α-spectrin is ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo. In order to define the ubiquitinated repeats of this long protein and find out a possible function, we have produced recombinant peptides encompassing the αIII-, αIV-, αV- and EF hand domains of α-spectrin chain. These peptides were tested in in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assays and two regions susceptibles to ubiquitination were found. The first one, in the αIV-domain, includes the repeat 17 and the second one, in the αV-domain, includes the repeat 20 and a part of repeat 21. We also demonstrated that the susceptibility to ubiquitination of the αV-domain is reduced by interaction with the corresponding portion of ?-spectrin chain (?IV-domain). Thus, at least ubiquitination of αV-domain is susceptible to cytoskeleton assembly and spectrin dimerization.

AB  - Accessible summary This paper reports on the issue of resuscitation in mental health inpatient environments. It reviews the literature on national standards and best practice when emergency situations arise in mental health settings. The discussion on the best practice literature takes place alongside the reporting of a national evaluation of how National Patient Safety Agency improvement guidelines for the provision for life support, and resuscitation for mental health service users was effectively implemented across health-care providers in England. Methods used to establish the effective use of the guidelines include feedback from clinical staff and staff responsible for the implementation of the new national standards for resuscitation. Serious incident data were also compared prior to the release of the national guidelines and after the guideline release dates. This included looking at events around choking and cardiac/respiratory arrest in inpatient areas. There were five deaths post-implementation of the guidelines that were considered to have serious enough error associated with the resuscitation process. This was down from 18 prior to the release of the guidelines. However, our survey showed that despite organisations reporting 100% compliance with the implementation of the guidelines, around half of frontline clinical staff were not aware of them. Although our survey responses show a contradiction between organisational and clinical staff awareness, our analysis suggests a reduction in moderate and severe harm cases and of deaths. There is evidence of a reduction in the worst types of error resulting in death, albeit with small numbers. Abstract In 2008, the National Patient Safety Agency issued a Rapid Response Report (RRR) aimed at health-care organisations providing inpatient care for mental health and learning disability patients, requiring organisations to make proper provision for life support and resuscitation for these patients. This paper examines whether effective implementation of the RRR recommendations had occurred across health providers in England. The methods used in this paper are the following: (1) Questionnaires were distributed nationally to clinical staff and implementation leads; (2) A national comparison of the number and severity of pre- and post-RRR release-related incidents involving choking/cardiac/respiratory arrest in Mental Health and Learning Disabilities settings was conducted; (3) Organisational compliance with the patient safety alert for all National Health Service Organisations in England was measured. There were five deaths post-implementation of the RRR that were considered to have serious enough error associated with the resuscitation. This was down from 18 deaths pre the RRR release. Although our survey responses show a contradiction between organisational implementation and clinical staff awareness, our analysis suggests a reduction in moderate and severe harm cases and of deaths. There is evidence of a reduction in the worst types of error resulting in death, albeit with small numbers.

AB  - Abstract In this study the clinical and histopathological effects of topically applied tripeptide-copper complex (TCC) and zinc oxide on open-wound healing in rabbits was evaluated. Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups: TCC, zinc oxide and no treatment. One full thickness wound was created on each side of the dorsal midline in each rabbit. Wound margins were traced on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 and topical TCC and zinc oxide were applied daily for 21 days to each rabbit in the respective treatment groups. The mean unhealed wound area was significantly smaller in the TCC than in the zinc oxide group on day 7, but it was significantly smaller in the TCC group than in to the control group on days 7, 14 and 21. The mean percentage of wound contraction on day 7 was significantly higher in the TCC than in the zinc oxide group; however, it was significantly higher in the TCC group than in the control group on days 7, 14 and 21. Median time for the coverage of the wound bed with granulation tissue was significantly shorter in the TCC group than in the other groups. Filling of the open wound with granulation tissue to skin level was significantly slower in the control group than in the other two groups. Neutrophil counts decreased regardless of the group in parallel with healing, while neovascularization was best observed in the TCC group. The results suggest that TCC is a better choice in the treatment protocols of open wounds in rabbits than zinc oxide.

AB  - Hydrogel-based drug delivery systems can leverage therapeutically favorable upshots of drug release and found clinical uses. Hydrogels offer temporal and spatial control over the release of different therapeutic agents. Because of their tailor made controllable degradability, physical properties, and ability to prevent the labile drugs from degradation, hydrogels provide platform on which diverse physicochemical interactions with entrapped drugs cause to control drug release. Herein, we report the fabrication of novel vinyltrimethoxy silane (VTMS) cross-linked chitosan/polyvinyl pyrrolidone hydrogels. Swelling in distilled water in conjunction with different buffer and electrolyte solutions was performed to assess the swellability of hydrogels. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were further conducted to investigate the possible interactions between components, thermal stability, and crystallinity of as-prepared hybrid hydrogels, respectively. In vitro time-dependent biodegradability, antimicrobial study, and cytotoxicity were also carried out to evaluate their extensive biocompatibility and cytotoxic behavior. More interestingly, in vitro drug release study allowed for the controlled release of cephradine. Therefore, this facile strategy developed the novel biocompatible and biodegradable hybrid hydrogels, which could significantly expand the scope of these hydrogels in other biomedical applications like scaffolds, skin regeneration, tissue engineering, etc.

AB  - Abstract Patulin is a common fungal contaminant of ripe apples used for the production of apple juice concentrates and it is also present in other fruits, vegetables and food products. Patulin is a secondary metabolite produced by species of the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Byssochlamys. Patulin has been reported to be mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are of prime importance in the innate immune response; they capture antigen in tissues and then migrate to the lymphoid organs to present the antigen to T lymphocytes. Thus, they are crucial for the initiation of immunity. Interdigitating dendritic cells (IDCs) are a subset of APCs that are present at the lymphatic organs. In the thymus, they act in positive and negative selection during T cell development. In the present study, patulin was administered orally to growing male rats aged 5?6 weeks. A dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1?bw?day?1 was given to rats for a period of 60 or 90 days daily. The effect of patulin on the IDCs of thymus was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results were evaluated in terms of cell destruction. In the rats of the control group, it was observed that the IDCs had an indented nucleus, a clear cytoplasm and numerous membrane extensions. In the cytoplasm, a well-developed golgi complex, mitochondria, granular endoplasmic reticulum and a small number of lysosomal structures were observed. At day 60 of patulin-treated rat groups (P-60), loss of cristae in mitochondria and chromatin margination and lysis in the nucleus were found. It was observed that the IDCs had a perinuclear area of cytoplasm surrounded by a peripheral electron-lucent zone. In the cytoplasm of the 90-day patulin-treated rat group (P-90), a peripheral electron-lucent zone was also found, similar to the P-60 group. Additionally increase in vesicular and lysosomal structures, increase in apoptotic bodies and condensation of chromatin in the nucleus were noted. It was observed that patulin leads to apoptotic body formation and cell apoptosis in the IDCs of rat thymus especially in the P-90-treated groups. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT High solid content waterborne polyurethane acrylate (WPUA) nanoemulsions are prepared as textile finishes. Two structurally different soft segments, that is, polyether and polyester are used with isophorone diisocyanate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate. Structural variations are investigated in features of nanoemulsions and their coatings. Physical properties of nanoemulsions, such as average particle size, stability, solid content, and viscosity, are investigated. Nanoemulsions with high solid content, that is, 40?47% are produced without any internal emulsifier. Average nanoparticle size, that is, <100 nm is confirmed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy proved synthesis of proposed WPUA products. Synergistic effect of polyurethane and acrylate is observed in chemical and water resistance of WPUA. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis indicate stable uniformly cross-linked network of WPUA. Application of nanoemulsions on 100% cotton fabric shows a significant improvement in tear strength, which is more pronounced for polyester-based WPUA. Scanning electron microscope images of treated fabric samples show good adhesion of nanoemulsions on cotton surface. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 41706.

AB  - The folding mechanism and stability of dimeric formate dehydrogenase from Candida methylica was analysed by exposure to denaturing agents and to heat. Equilibrium denaturation data yielded a dissociation constant of about 10?13 M for assembly of the protein from unfolded chains and the kinetics of refolding and unfolding revealed that the overall process comprises two steps. In the first step a marginally stable folded monomeric state is formed at a rate (k 1) of about 2 ? 10?3 s?1 (by deduction k ?1 is about10?4 s?1) and assembles into the active dimeric state with a bimolecular rate constant (k 2) of about 2 ? 104 M?1 s?1. The rate of dissociation of the dimeric state in physiological conditions is extremely slow (k ?2 ? 3 ? 10?7 s?1).

AB  - Abstract E-waste is recognized as the fastest growing waste stream in the world. It contains toxic substances such as heavy metals and flame retardants that are hazardous to human and ecological health. Despite these environmental and health hazards, the vast majority of consumers are reluctant to dispose of e-waste and prefer to store obsolete products at home instead of returning them to manufacturers for recycling. To address this alarming problem, we use the basic psychological needs theory (BPNT) and word of mouth (WOM) to profile consumer behaviour changes and explain self-reported consumer e-waste disposal behaviours. Based on longitudinal survey data collected over two rounds from Pakistan, the findings support the role of BPNT. Particularly, the results show that positive WOM messages about e-waste disposal significantly improve consumers' self-determined needs that, in turn, fuel consumers' integrated motivation for e-waste and subsequent e-waste disposal behaviours. The implications of these findings for practitioners regarding consumer behavioural changes are discussed in-depth.

AB  - Summary Objectives? To estimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight among adults in a high mountain rural population of Pakistan, and to determine the correlates of excess body weight. Design? Cross-sectional study. Methods? A random sample of 4203 adults (aged 18?years and over) was selected by stratified random sampling from 16 villages in north Pakistan. Trained medical students measured height, weight and blood pressure. Trained interviewers obtained information from participants on sociodemographic variables, use of snuff, daily cigarette consumption, hypertension and family history of hypertension. Body mass index (BMI) calculated as kg/m2 was used to define overweight (BMI?≥?25?kg/m2) and obesity (BMI?≥?30?kg/m2). Results? Using weight and height data available for 1391 men and 2754 women, mean BMI was 22.4 (95% CI 21.9, 22.9) for men and 22.6 (95% CI 21.9, 23.2) for women. The age-adjusted prevalence of BMI?≥?25 (overweight/obesity) was 13.5% for men and 14.1% for women. Overweight/obesity increased with age and the increase per year was identical for both men and women [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)?=?1.01, 95% CI 1.01, 1.03]. Overweight/obese men and women were more likely to be hypertensive (men, AOR?=?3.32, 95% CI 2.16, 5.09; women, AOR?=?1.70, 95% CI 1.21, 2.39). Overweight/obese women were more likely to work in business or as skilled workers (AOR?=?6.24, 95% CI 1.18, 32.83) while overweight/obese men were more likely to work as government employees (AOR?=?2.59, 95% CI 1.66, 4.03). Family history of hypertension was a significant correlate of overweight/obesity in men (P value 0.004) and women (P value 0.000). Overweight/obese men and women were less likely to use smokeless tobacco (men, AOR?=?0.65, 95% CI 0.43, 0.97; women, AOR?=?0.54, 95% CI 0.35, 0.85). Conclusion? The prevalence of risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Pakistan is expected to increase as further epidemiologic, nutritional and demographic changes occur. The assessment of excess body weight, and patterns and determinants of other risk factors for NCDs is important to provide useful guidelines in the planning of interventions to counter a growing problem.

AB  - Summary Background.? Cutaneous nonhealing ulceration is a threatening manifestation of vasculitis. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), frequently used as adjuvant therapy for patients with ischaemic ulcers, exerts additional beneficial effects on the vascular inflammatory response. Aim.? To evaluate the effect of HBO on vasculitis-induced nonhealing skin ulcers. Methods.? The study population comprised 35 patients aged ≥?18?years with severe, nonhealing, vasculitis-induced ulcers that had not improved following immunosuppressive therapy. Baseline ulcer tissue oxygenation was evaluated at room air concentration (21% O2), at 1?atmosphere absolute (ATA) breathing 100% O2, and at 2 ATA breathing 100% O2. The baseline treatment protocol consisted of a 4-week course of 100% O2 for 90?min at 2 ATA, five times/week. Results.? The mean baseline ulcer tissue oxygenation (3.1?±?2.4?kPa at room air concentration), was significantly increased to 13.9?±?11.9?kPa at 1 ATA breathing 100% O2 (P?<?0.001), and subsequently increased further to 59.1?±?29.8?kPa at 2 ATA breathing 100% O2 (P?<?0.001). At the end of the hyperbaric therapy, 28 patients (80%) demonstrated complete healing, 4 (11.4%) had partial healing and 3 (8.6%) had no improvement. None of the patients had any side-effects related to the HBO therapy. Conclusion.? HBO therapy may serve as an effective safe treatment for patients with vasculitis having nonhealing skin ulcers. Further studies are needed to evaluate its role as primary therapy for this group of patients.

Removed plasma was replaced by a synthetic colloid solution and human albumin other than fresh-frozen plasma. Plasmapheresis led to decreases in serum T3 concentrations >78?40% and free T4 concentrations >69%. Near-total thyroidectomy could be performed in all patients. Although screening coagulation tests were within normal limits, patients 1 and 4 experienced more blood loss than usual during the operative procedure. Plasmapheresis could be used as an alternative therapeutic option in the preoperative management of severe hyperthyroid patients with contraindications to antithyroid drugs. However, this is an invasive procedure and patients should be followed carefully for prolonged clinic/subclinic coagulopathy due to plasma exchange.

AB  - Background Cancer rehabilitation medicine is a growing field in physiatry, but more studies are needed to demonstrate how physiatry can contribute to patient care within the cancer care continuum. Objective To quantify and describe physiatric participation during a multidisciplinary tumor board for breast cancer patients. Design A prospective descriptive study. Setting A multidisciplinary breast tumor board at a large academic medical center. Participants Five hundred thirty-seven breast cancer cases presented at a multidisciplinary breast tumor board. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The number of times physiatry actively participated in a multidisciplinary breast tumor board in the categories of referral to physiatry, referral to rehabilitation services, referral to other services, advice given on patients/symptom management, and discussion of available services. Results Out of 537 breast cancer cases presented, 221 cases (41.2%) resulted in a physiatry recommendation for referral to either physiatry, rehabilitation services, other services, or advice on patient and symptom management. Conclusion Physiatry can actively participate in the care of cancer patients during a multidisciplinary breast cancer tumor board.

AB  - Background information. The α- and ?-spectrin chains constitute the filaments of the spectrin-based skeleton, which was first identified in erythrocytes. The discovery of analogous structures at plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells has led to investigations of the role of this spectrin skeleton in many cellular processes. The αII-spectrin chain expressed in nucleated cells harbours in its central region several functional motifs, including an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain. Results. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified EVL [Enabled/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)-like protein] as a new potential partner of the αII-spectrin SH3 domain. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of the αII-spectrin SH3 domain with EVL and compared this with other proteins related to EVL [Mena (mammalian Enabled) and VASP]. We confirmed the in vitro interaction between EVL and the αII-spectrin SH3 domain by GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assays, and showed that the co-expression of EVL with the αII-spectrin SH3 domain in COS-7 cells resulted in the partial delocalization of the SH3 domain from cytoplasm to filopodia and lamellipodia, where it was co-localized with EVL. In kidney epithelial and COS-7 cells, we demonstrated the co-immunoprecipitation of the αII-spectrin chain with over-expressed EVL. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the over-expression of EVL in COS-7 cells promoted the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, and the expressed EVL was detected in filopodial tips and the leading edge of lamellipodia. In these cells over-expressing EVL, the αII-spectrin membrane labelling lagged behind EVL staining in lamellipodia and filopodia, with co-localization of these two stains in the contact area. In kidney epithelial cell lines, focused co-localization of spectrin with expressed EVL was observed in the membrane of the lateral domain, where the cell?cell contacts are reinforced. Conclusions. The possible link between the spectrin-based skeleton and actin via the EVL protein suggests a new way of integrating the spectrin-based skeleton in areas of dynamic actin reorganization.

AB  - We have previously shown that hepcidin transgenic embryos are severely anemic and die around birth. Here, we report that embryonic hepcidin transgene expression decreases transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mRNA level in placenta, as shown by cDNA microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR, by a mechanism which is independent of placenta iron content and iron responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) activity. On the contrary, iron injections into pregnant mothers result in increased placenta iron and ferritin content, and reduced IRE binding activity of IRP1 leading to decreased TfR1 mRNA level. Taken together, these results suggest that hepcidin action on placenta is mostly through transcriptional downregulation of the iron uptake machinery.

AB  - A test to detect very early hemorrhage in acute cerebral infarct could offer a substantial increase in the safety and success of advanced stroke therapies, particularly when the use of thrombolytic therapies is contemplated. Currently, computed tomography is the standard test for the detection of cerebral hemorrhage but is not a valid predictor of potential areas of hemorrhagic transformation. A technique to evaluate the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in infarcted cerebral tissue has been conducted with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in various animal stroke models. Knight demonstrated Gadolinium-DTPA enhancement in the territory of occluded vessels immediately in rats after reperfusion. Gadolinium enhancement was thought to predict areas of hemorrhagic transformation. Yenari and associates demonstrated in rabbit models that contrast-enhanced T1-weighted scans can reveal regions of blood-brain barrier disruption, characterized as hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic tissue. The authors report a clinical example in which hyperacute contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was the first indication of hemorrhagic transformation within 24 hours of onset of an acute cerebral infarct.

AB  - Abstract Using two theoretical lenses?organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE) and supplies-values fit theory (SVFT)?the present study examines the influence of green human resource management (HRM) practices on environmental performance using data from higher education institutions. To this end, our research uses survey data from n = 214 employees to test the moderated mediation hypotheses. The study finds that green HRM practices positively enhance environmental performance via employees' environmental passion. Our study further reveals that the effect of green HRM practices on environmental passion is more important when an employee is high on green values than when s/he is low. The current study provides new theoretical insights into environmental management literature by linking green HRM practices to environmental performance. Our findings provide managers with guidance regarding how and when green HRM practices are more likely to lead to enhanced environmental performance.

AB  - Abstract A variety of bacterial enterocolitis in their active stages are characterized by the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) across epithelial surfaces. These mechanisms could explain some effects of enterotoxins observed in the intestinal mucosae. Here, using specific inhibitors, we investigated the potential role of CD10 (E.C. 3.4.24.11), present at the surface of human neutrophils, on formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced PMN migration across cultured monolayers of the human intestinal cell line T84. Transmigration of human neutrophils across T84 epithelial cells was observed for concentrations of fMLP as low as 10?9 M, whereas maximal effect was achieved at 10?7 M as determined by transepithelial resistances and PMN myeloperoxidase assays. RB25, a CD10 inhibitor, reduced by two orders of magnitude the concentration of fMLP required to obtain full neutrophil transmigration across T84 epithelial cell line. RB25 response was concentration dependent with half-maximal and maximal effect occurring at 10?9 and 10?7 M, respectively. These concentrations of RB25 corresponded exactly to the half-maximal and maximal inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11 at the neutrophil cell surface. However, the effect of CD10 inhibitors on PMN transmigration cannot be accounted for by a direct action on T84 epithelial cells, since these cells fail to express any detectable endopeptidase 24.11 activity. Moreover, blocking of CD10 enzymatic activity by various and selective inhibitors potentiated the effect of low concentrations of fMLP on PMN transmigration. Finally, RB25 failed to affect interleukin-8 (IL-8)-induced PMN transmigration across T84 epithelial cells, in agreement with the preference of CD10 for small peptidic substrates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of CD10 significantly reduced the concentration of fMLP needed for eliciting transmigration of PMN across intestinal epithelia. J. Leukoc. Biol. 63: 312?320; 1998.
