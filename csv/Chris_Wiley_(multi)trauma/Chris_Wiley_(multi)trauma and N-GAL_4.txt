AB  - Primary Familial Brain Calcification (PFBC) is a dominantly inherited cerebral microvascular calcifying disorder with diverse neuropsychiatric expression. Three causative genes have been identified: SLC20A2, PDGFRB and, recently, PDGFB, whose associated phenotype has not yet been extensively studied. We included in the largest published case series of genetically confirmed PFBC, 19 PDGFB (including three new mutations), 24 SLC20A2 (including 4 new mutations), and 14 PDGFRB mutation carriers, from two countries (France and Brazil). We studied clinical features and applied our visual rating scale on all 49 available CT scans. Among the symptomatic mutation carriers (33/57, 58%), the three most frequently observed categories of clinical features were psychiatric signs (72.7%, 76.5%, and 80% for PDGFB, SLC20A2, and PDGFRB, respectively), movement disorders (45.5%, 76.5%, and 40%), and cognitive impairment (54.6%, 64.7%, and 40%). The median age of clinical onset was 31 years, 25% had an early onset (before 18) and 25% a later onset (after 53). Patients with an early clinical onset exhibited mostly isolated psychiatric or cognitive signs, while patients with a later onset exhibited mostly movement disorders, especially in association with other clinical features. CT scans rating allowed identifying four patterns of calcification. The total calcification score was best predicted by the combined effects of gene (SLC20A2?>?PDGFB?>?PDGFRB mutations), sex (male), and (increasing) age, defining three risk classes, which correlated with the four patterns of calcification. These calcification patterns could reflect the natural history of the calcifying process, with distinct risk classes characterized by different age at onset or rate of progression. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The design, synthesis, and potential application of the pipecolic linker is presented. This new versatile handle can immobilize primary, secondary, and aromatic amines, as well as alcohols, phenols, and hydrazides, on a solid support. Compared with other linkers, the anchoring step is easy and efficient. The release of final products from the resin proceeds upon acidic treatment with high purities. The pipecolic linker offers the promise of being using in peptide chemistry to produce peptides modified at the N and C terminus, peptidomimetics, as well as small organic molecules.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Fluticasone furoate (FF) is a novel inhaled corticosteroid with 24-h activity. FF is in development as a once-daily treatment for asthma as monotherapy and in combination with vilanterol (VI), a long-acting ?2 agonist. Corticosteroids can have systemic effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, potentially resulting in cortisol suppression. Objectives To assess the effect of FF/VI compared with placebo on the HPA axis by evaluating 24-h weighted mean serum cortisol levels in adolescent and adult patients with persistent asthma. Methods One hundred eighty-five patients with >12 weeks history of asthma were randomised in a 4:4:4:1 ratio to one of two once-daily FF/VI treatments (100/25??g or 200/25??g), placebo or an active control group that received inhaled placebo plus one prednisolone 10?mg capsule daily for the last 7 days of the study. Twenty-four-hour serum and urinary cortisol was measured at baseline and on day 42. Results Non-inferiority in 24-h weighted mean serum cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment with once-daily FF/VI at either strength was shown. Treatment ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] to placebo for FF/VI 100/25??g [0.99 (0.87?1.12)] or FF/VI 200/25??g [0.97 (0.86?1.10)] indicated non-inferiority of both FF/VI doses to placebo as the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than the predefined 0.8. Prednisolone substantially reduced 24-h weighted mean serum cortisol [treatment ratio to placebo 0.34 (0.28?0.41)]. FF/VI was well-tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. Conclusions FF/VI was found to be non-inferior to placebo on HPA axis function, with no indication of significant cortisol suppression after 42 days.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an environmentally friendly and economically feasible technique used for reclamation of environment contaminated with toxic heavy metals. The present study was conducted to investigate the levels of heavy metals in chromite mining impacted soil and native plant species using atomic absorption spectrometry. The contaminated soil collected from mine-impacted sites showed multifold enrichment of heavy metals Cr, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, while the pollution load index value was >3. Heavy metal concentrations were significantly (p?<?0.01) higher in soil and plant species of chromite impacted sites as compared to the reference site. The high metal concentrations could be due to emission of dust during chromite mining and open dumping of mine wastes. High metal concentrations may cause potential threats to the local community as well as grazing animals (cows, sheep, and goats) of the study area. The plant species like Solanum surattense, Dodonaea viscosa, Rhazya stracta, Calotropis procera, and Artemisia scoparia showed good metal accumulation capacity grown in chromite mining impacted soils and could be used for phytoremediation.

AB  - Abstract In this work, primary, secondary and tertiary bis(amide) derivatives of DTPA have been synthesized and the residence time of the water molecule coordinated to their gadolinium complexes has been measured by variable temperature 17O NMR spectroscopy. The influence of substituent characteristics (molecular mass, hydrophobicity, volume) has been studied. For the primary and secondary bis(amide) complexes, increasing the length of the lateral chains decreases the water residence time. It varies from 1171±38 ns for [Gd(DTPA-BA)(H2O)] to 673±32 ns for [Gd(DTPA-BHeptA)(H2O)]. The activation volumes of 5 bis(amide) complexes {[Gd(DTPA-BA)(H2O)], [Gd(DTPA-BEA)(H2O)], [Gd(DTPA-BnBA)(H2O)], [Gd(DTPA-BAA)(H2O)], and [Gd(DTPA-BHA)(H2O)]} have been measured by a variable pressure 17O NMR spectroscopic study. No change in the activation volume is observed when the substituent size is increased. The inner sphere is therefore not disturbed by the substitution on the amide groups. The slight decrease in water residence time can be attributed to the hydrophobicity increase of the complexes which, in turn, leads to a hydrophobic environment favorable to water molecule exchange. The water residence time of tertiary bis(amide) complexes is similar to the fastest secondary bis(amide) complex. For the tertiary bis(amide) complexes, a length increase by the substituent does not change the residence time. According to these results, we suspect that a disruption of the hydration shell of the complexes by amide substituents occurs that can influence coordinated water exchange by a factor of two, at most.

AB  - Abstract Hexamethylenetetramine dinitrate (HDN) is a rather weak explosive but is used as a precursor for the synthesis of RDX, one of the most important secondary nitramine explosives. HDN has limited application because of its hygroscopic character. This paper reports on the synthesis and characterization of HDN in high yield and purity by the reaction of hexamine with nitric acid at temperatures below 15?°C. It was characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) measurements. The thermal characteristics of HDN were determined by DSC and TG/DTA. The DSC curve of HDN shows an endothermic peak at 170.5?°C corresponding to the melting point of HDN, followed by two exothermic peaks at 174.0?°C and 200.5?°C due to the decomposition. The differences in the thermal behavior of HDN samples, which were thermally aged at 50?°C, 100?°C, and 150?°C in a nitrogen atmosphere were examined. Additionally, some quantum chemical properties of the nitration of hexamethylenetetramine were calculated.

AB  - summary HsvG is a virulence factor that determines the host specificity of Erwinia herbicola pathovars gypsophilae and betae on gypsophila. We used the calmodulin adenylate cyclase reporter (CyaA) to demonstrate that HsvG is secreted and translocated into HeLa cells by the type III secretion system (TTSS) of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). A fusion of HsvG-CyaA containing 271 amino acids of the N-terminus of HsvG were introduced into a wild-type EPEC, espB mutant deficient in translocation and an escV mutant deficient in secretion. A significant secretion was detected in EPEC/HsvG-CyaA and its espB mutant, but not with the escV mutant. Translocation was only observed with the wild-type EPEC, and not with the other two mutants. To localize the secretion and translocation signals of HsvG, fusions containing 39, 11 and 3 amino acids of the N-terminus of HsvG were constructed and expressed in EPEC. A fusion containing the first 39 N-terminal amino acids of HsvG was secreted and translocated at significant level (31?35%) as compared to the original fusion. In contrast, fusions containing the 3 and 11 amino acids failed to be secreted and translocated.

AB  - Abstract The mode of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in patients who deny parenteral exposure is still not understood. Seroprevalence studies of anti-HCV in sexually promiscuous populations and in spouses of infected patients have given contradictory results. We investigated the role of sexual transmission of HCV in a case-control study of risk factors for infection in a series of 43 anti-HCV positive pregnant women and 172 matched controls (4 for each case). In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated significantly with anti-HCV seropositivity: low social class, unmarried, history of abortion, wounds which were sutured, tattooes, sharing toiletries with the partner, sexual contact outside the partnership without condom use, blood transfusion, and intravenous drug abuse, but only the last 3 factors remained significantly associated with HCV infection in multiple logistic regression analysis. The relative risk of HCV infection increased according to the increased number of sexual partners. Thus sexual transmission must be considered a possible mode of infection in HCV infected persons without parenteral exposures. J. Med. Virol. 52:164?167, 1997. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Prior research has broadly captured consumers' green behaviour by linking it to either intrinsic or extrinsic motives. Nonetheless, the detailed effects of middle-ground motives (i.e., external, introjected, and identified) on the formation of green consumer behaviour remain largely untapped in marketing literature. Using two theoretical lenses?organismic integration theory of self-determination theory and gender schema theory?this study investigates the effects of motivational regulations on consumers' green behaviour using data from Pakistani millennial consumers. To this end, two separate but related studies were conducted. Study 1 involved participants (n = 208) from Sindh province, whereas Study 2 recruited subjects from three other provinces of Pakistan: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan (n = 312). Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modelling, and multigroup modelling techniques were used as methods. Study 1 shows that when intrinsic motivation and three types of extrinsic motivations (i.e., external, introjected, and identified) were examined, identified motivation had the strongest effect on green consumer behaviour. The findings of Study 2 indicated that, compared with males, females responded much more strongly to motivation associated with intrinsic regulation. Likewise, male consumers tended to respond much more strongly to identified and external motivations with regard to their green behaviour. To conclude this study, the implications of these findings are discussed in great detail.

AB  - Summary Background Detection of Helicobacter pylori antigen in stool samples has been a subject of controversy. However, it has been included in several clinical guidelines as a recommended non-invasive testing procedure in dyspeptic patients. Aim To compare a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay for detection of H. pylori stool antigen (Amplified IDEIA HpStAR, DakoCytomation) with a polyclonal enzyme immunoassay (HpSA test, Premier Platinum HpSA, Meridian Diagnostics) in diagnosing infection and in determining H. pylori status after eradication treatment. Methods We evaluated stool samples of 198 patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection and of 41 patients without infection. The results of the monoclonal enzyme immunoassay HpStAR were compared with those of the polyclonal enzyme immunoassay HpSA. Results The sensitivity and specificity of HpStAR were 91.9% and 70.7%, while those of HpSA were 89.4% and 80.5%, respectively. In the 126 patients evaluated 6?weeks after eradication therapy, the overall agreement between urea breath test and HpStAR was 90.5% (P?=?0.710) and between urea breath test and HpSA was 76.9% (P?=?0.410). Conclusions HpStAR is a rapid and easy-to-perform test with similar sensitivity to HpSA in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection, although it had lower specificity. In contrast, HpStAR is more accurate after eradication therapy than HpSA.

AB  - Abstract Besides a fundamental structural role at the plasma membrane, spectrin- and actin-based skeletons have been proposed to participate in various processes including vesicular trafficking. Neuroendocrine cells release hormones and neuropeptides through calcium-regulated exocytosis, a process that is coordinated by a fine remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We describe here that calcium-regulated exocytosis is impaired in chromaffin and PC12 cells with reduced αII-spectrin expression levels. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we show that neuronal Wiskott?Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) is a partner of the αII-spectrin SH3 domain and demonstrate that secretagogue-evoked N-WASP recruitment at cell periphery is blocked in the absence of αII-spectrin. Additionally, experiments performed with ectopically expressed αII-spectrin mutant unable to bind N-WASP indicated that the interaction between SH3 domain and N-WASP is pivotal for neuroendocrine secretion. Our results extend the list of spectrin interactors and strengthen the idea that αII-spectrin is an important scaffold protein that gathers crucial actin-related players of the exocytic machinery.

AB  - Recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) is a hallmark of both urinary and digestive infections caused byEscherichia coli. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF-1) is a toxin produced by uropathogenic E. coli strains that mediates its effects via the activation of small GTP-binding proteins. However, the role and the consequences of CNF-1 on PMNL physiology remain largely unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that CNF-1 dramatically affects the PMNL cytoskeleton architecture by inducing an increased content of F-actin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CNF-1 increases functional features of PMNL, such as superoxide generation and adherence on epithelial T84 monolayers, but significantly decreases their phagocytic function. Our results suggest that CNF-1 may behave as a virulence factor in urinary or digestive infection by stimulating PMNL cytotoxicity as a result of its enhancing effect on their adherence to epithelial cells as well as the production of radical oxygen products. Moreover, the decreased phagocytosis of PMNL induced by CNF-1 likely facilitates growth of bacteria. In these conditions, CNF-1 would intervene in the initiation and in the perpetuation of the inflammatory process.

AB  - Abstract Hepcidin, a recently discovered iron regulatory peptide, is believed to inhibit the release of iron from absorptive enterocytes and macrophages. Liver hepcidin synthesis is induced in vivo by iron stores and inflammation. The molecular basis of the regulation of hepcidin gene expression by these effectors in hepatocytes is currently unknown, although there is strong evidence that indirect mechanisms are involved. The aims of this study were to gain insight into these mechanisms and to determine to what extent other liver cell types are responsible for transducing the signal by which hepcidin expression is regulated in mouse hepatocytes. For this, we depleted Kupffer cells by injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate and then studied iron- and inflammation-induced hepcidin gene expression. In addition, we directly evaluated the role of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) by using IL-6?deficient mice. Our results show that iron is able to induce hepcidin gene expression independently of Kupffer cells in the liver and circulating IL-6. In contrast, we show that hepcidin gene induction by inflammation is also independent of Kupffer cells, but involves, at least partly, IL-6. In conclusion, these results show that two independent regulatory pathways control hepcidin gene expression and suggest that hepatocytes play a key role in the regulation of hepcidin gene expression by sensing iron and inflammatory signals.

AB  - Abstract Aim? The aim of this systematic review was to compare laparoscopic and/or laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy (LRC) with open right colectomy (ORC). Many randomized clinical trial have shown that laparoscopic colectomy benefits patients with improved short-term outcomes and comparable overall survival in respect to the open approach. These results, however, could not be applied to right colectomy owing to its wide range of resection and more complicated vascular regional anatomy. Method? We performed a meta-analysis of the literature in order to compare LRC vs ORC by examining 21 end-points including operative and recovery outcomes, early postoperative mortality and morbidity, and oncological parameters. A subgroup analysis of patients undergoing right colectomy for cancer was carried out. The meta-analysis was conducted following all aspects of the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metanalysis (PRISMA) statement. The search strategies were developed using the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBM reviews and CINAHL until March 2011. We included randomized and non randomized studies that compared the LRC vs ORC for benign disease and malignant neoplasm irrespective of publication status. Only studies in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian languages were considered for inclusion. Emergency right colectomies were excluded. To perform the statistical analysis we used the odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results? Seventeen studies, 15 nonrandomized clinical trials and two randomized clinical trials, involving a total of 1489 patients, were identified. The mean operative time was longer in the group of patients undergoing LRC [weighted mean difference (WMD)?=?37.94, 95% CI: 25.01 to 50.88; P?<?0.00001]. Intra-operative blood loss (WMD?=??96.61; 95% CI: ?150.68 to ?42.54; P?=?0.0005), length of hospital stay (WMD?=??2.29; 95% CI: ?3.96 to ?0.63; P?=?0.007) and short-term postoperative morbidity (OR?=?0.64; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.83; P?=?0.0009) were significantly in favour of LRC. Conclusion? Laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy results in less blood loss, a shorter length of hospital stay and lower postoperative short-term morbidity compared with ORC.

AB  - Background:? Uncontrolled asthma is characterized by variability. Current asthma guidelines recommend focussing on the achievement and maintenance of control but few studies have examined in detail, using composite measures of control, the stability and potential duration of control once achieved. In this post-hoc analysis of the results of the Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) study, we examine the association between the level of asthma control achieved during the step-up phase of the study and the stability of control experienced during the maintenance phase. Methods:? GOAL was a 1-year, randomized, stratified, double-blind study of 3421 patients with uncontrolled asthma, which compared salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination with fluticasone propionate in achieving two composite, guideline-based measures of control: totally controlled and well-controlled asthma. We analysed the proportion and duration of time spent in control, the effect of treatment on asthma stability, and the impact of asthma control stability on unscheduled use of healthcare resources. Results:? In patients achieving well-controlled or totally controlled asthma, at least well-controlled asthma was maintained for a median of almost 3?and 6?months, and for more than 85% and 95% of weeks of follow-up, respectively. A high level of stability was confirmed in a Markov analysis investigating transitional probability of change in control status. Variability in control was associated with increased probability of an unscheduled healthcare resource use (odds ratio: 1.06, P?<?0.001). Conclusions:? Most patients achieving guideline-defined control can maintain at least a similar level of control with regular, stable dosing, with little likelihood of losing control.

AB  - Abstract Aim? The study aimed to compare robotic rectal resection with laparoscopic rectal resection for cancer. Robotic surgery has been used successfully in many branches of surgery but there is little evidence in the literature on its use in rectal cancer. Methods? We performed a systematic review of the available literature in order to evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of robotic versus laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. We compared robotic and laparoscopic surgery with respect to twelve end-points including operative and recovery outcomes, early postoperative mortality and morbidity, and oncological parameters. A subgroup analysis of patients undergoing full-robotic or robot-assisted rectal resection and robotic total mesorectal excision was carried out. All aspects of Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metanalysis (PRISMA) statement were followed to conduct this systematic review. Comprehensive electronic search strategies were developed using the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBM reviews and CINAHL. Randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials comparing robotic and laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer were included. No language or publication status restrictions were imposed. A data-extraction sheet was developed based on the data extraction template of the Cochrane Group. The statistical analysis was performed using the odd ratio (OR) for categorical variables and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables. Results? Eight non randomized studies were identified that included 854 patients in total, 344 (40.2%) in the robotic group and 510 (59.7%) in the laparoscopic group. Meta-analysis suggested that the conversion rate to open surgery in the robotic group was significantly lower than that with laparoscopic surgery (OR?=?0.26, 95% CI: 0.12?0.57, P?=?0.0007). There were no significant differences in operation time, length of hospital stay, time to resume regular diet, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and the oncological accuracy of resection. Conclusion? Robotic surgery for rectal cancer has a lower conversion rate and a similar operative time compared with laparoscopic surgery, with no difference in recovery, oncological and postoperative outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Pure water is becoming less available with increases in world population, so seawater desalination is becoming more important. For efficient seawater desalination, this paper proposes a novel mixed matrix membrane (MMM) based on the deposition of a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibrous active layer on a 3-triethoxysilylpropylamine-functionalized cellulose acetate substrate. The active layer is fabricated by utilizing a tetraethyl orthosilicate?crosslinked PVA incorporating zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and sodium alginate (NaAlg). The overall reverse osmosis performance of the MMMs is enhanced by the infusion of ZnO-NPs and NaAlg in PVA; we find the optimum concentration for the best performance to be ZnO-NPs at 0.1 wt % and NaAlg at 0.01 wt %. In terms of permeation flux, salt rejection, salt passage, stability, long-term rejection, membrane antifouling, reusability, and chlorine resistance, the proposed MMMs are examined using a dead-end reverse osmosis filtration setup. The results show that the active layer achieves an optimal permeation flux of 34.6 L/m2 h, a natural sea salt rejection of 97%, and a chlorine resistance of 93%, suggesting that the proposed MMMs can be useful for seawater desalination. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
