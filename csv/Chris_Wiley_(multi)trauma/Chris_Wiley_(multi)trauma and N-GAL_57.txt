AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - A novel biopolymer composed of porcine gelatin and dextran was used in a randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to treat diabetic foot ulcers to establish safety profile and evaluate effect on wound closure. Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized at 10 centers (control?=?25; E-Matrix?=?31). Control patients received routine sharp debridement, off-loading, and hydrogel dressings applied daily. E-Matrix patients received identical wound care with the addition of monthly subcutaneous injections of E-Matrix under the wound surface. Patients were monitored for 12 weeks using wound planimetry and photography. Primary endpoint was safety as measured by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory analysis. Secondary endpoint was wound closure based on intent to treat. There was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events between treated and control subjects. Overall closure rate for E-Matrix treated wounds was 42%(13 of 31 subjects) compared to 32%(8 of 25 subjects) for controls. Subgroup analysis suggested that E-Matrix may be more effective than control for treatment of larger (>2?cm2) and older (>17 weeks duration) wounds (see table). Parameter Treatment Group N Closed %Closed Size >2?cm E-Matrix 17 8 47% Control 14 4 29% Ulcer duration >17 weeks E-Matrix 15 6 40% Control 15 3 20% Although the study is insufficiently powered to evaluate statistical significance, E-Matrix demonstrated a similar safety profile to control treatment with trends toward improved healing in larger and older wounds. Further randomized trials are necessary to confirm these promising initial results.

AB  - The MRL mouse is the only known strain of mouse that can regenerate cardiac lesions and completely heal ear punches without scarring. To determine if the MRL also has greater regeneration capabilities in amputated digit tips, right paw digit tips of neonatal mice were dissected, with the left front paws as uncut controls. Controls used for regeneration comparison were the DBA, B6, C3H, and 129 inbred mouse strains. Consecutive X-ray images were captured of the left and right paws at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postamputation. MRL mouse digit tips regenerated greater in comparison to all strains tested (p?<?0.05). We next undertook whole genome microarray analysis to identify the genetic mechanisms that contribute to differences in digit tip regeneration. Over 400 genes out of 15,000 were significantly differentially expressed (p?<?0.05) in MRL and DBA mice at day 4 in comparison to day 0 control tissue. Of these, 170 genes were upregulated and 280 were downregulated in both mouse strains. Pathway analysis reveals that genes in the BMP/TGF pathway are differentially expressed in both mouse strains (p?<?0.05). Multiple differences between MRL and DBA strains were found in transcription factors that are implicated in gastrulation, including FMN2 and SHRM. Additional differentially expressed genes include NET1 in the WNT signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry indicates that these proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of chondrocytes in regenerating digits. We conclude that MRL mice show greater regenerative capacity to heal digit tips and that the increased regenerative capacity of MRL mice may be due to strain specific increased expression of genes involved in the WNT pathway and genes involved in embryonic pattern formation.

AB  - TGF?1 is a multipotent secreted cytokine that plays a pivotal role in wound healing. Previously, both positive and negative effects of TGF?1 on cutaneous wound healing have been reported. The mechanisms underlying these effects of TGF?1 remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of cutaneous wound healing, wherein the latent form of TGF?1 is constitutively expressed in basal keratinocytes of the mouse epidermis, targeted by the keratin 5 promoter (K5.TGF?1). In wild-type mice with 6-mm full thickness excisional cutaneous wounds, TGF?1 protein levels were elevated immediately after wounding, and reached a peak level on day 3 postwounding, which was 3?5-fold higher than that in the nonwounded skin, and sharply declined afterward. This elevated expression pattern suggests that only transient TGF?1 overexpression is required for normal wound healing. In contrast, K5.TGF?1 mice with prolonged TGF?1 transgene expression at the level equivalent to the above peak level in wild-type mice exhibited a significant delay in healing of 6-mm full thickness excisional wounds when compared to wild-type mice. Histological analysis of wounds revealed delayed reepithelialization, increased inflammation and prolonged granular tissue accumulation in K5.TGF?1wt mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed excessive leukocyte infiltration in transgenic wounds when compared to wild-type wounds. Understandably, the accumulation of leukocytes was also accompanied by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors and fibrotic factors as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Although the above factors override the growth inhibitory effect of TGF?1 on epidermal proliferation away from the wound edge, proliferation at the leading edge of the migrating keratinocytes was reduced in transgenic skin compared to the nontransgenic skin, evident by PCNA staining. Keratinocyte proliferation was also reduced in vitro when assessed by H3-thymidine incorporation. To assess the direct effect of TGF?1 on keratinocyte migration, we performed an in vitro migration assay and found that K5.TGF?1 keratinocytes had delayed migration when compared with wild-type cells. Our study suggests that prolonged TGF?1 expression in keratinocytes delays cutaneous wound healing by excessive inflammation, coupled to a direct inhibitory effect on keratinocyte proliferation and migration.

AB  - Background:? Essential parameters of wound healing are regulated by the wound environment., as reflected by the bathing wound fluid (WF). WF increases fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and also inhibits Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in wound-derived fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether WF influences NO metabolism in other wound cells, namely macrophages. Methods:? The mouse hybridoma macrophage cell line RAW 267.4 was employed. Cells were seeded at 2???105/well into 24 well plates or at 2???106 in Petri dishes. Cells were stimulated with 1??g/ml LPS and 10?U/ml IFN-gamma to induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS expression was investigated by Northern blotting after 6?h, enzyme secretion by western blotting after 20?h and NO production by nitrite synthesis in cell culture supernatants after 24?h. WF was harvested at different days postwounding from PVA sponges implanted into male Lewis rats. WF was added at 10%?v/v to the cell media. Cells were incubated in the presence of 60?mM L-valine, an arginase inhibitor, to rule out substrate (arginine) depletion by arginase as a mechanism. Results are expressed as mean?±?SD, n?=?5. Results:? Following inflammatory cytokine stimulation, RAW cells produced 57.36??mol nitrite/ml/24?h. Nitrite synthesis was significantly inhibited to 23.89?±?13.3 by day 7 and to 6.79?±?1.28 by day 10?WF, respectively. iNOS expression was almost completely blocked by addition of 10% WF from day 10 as assessed by Northern and western blotting. WF from the later days (day 10 and 14) had larger inhibitory effect than WF from early days (day 2, 5, and 7). Although omitting L-arginine from the media abolished iNOS expression, incubation of WF in the presence of 60?mM L-valine did not restore the inhibitory effect suggesting that arginase is not involved. Conclusion:? There is a factor in WF which strongly inhibits NO synthesis in RAW cells; the effect becomes more marked over time after wounding. The effect appears to be transcriptionally regulated since mRNA expression is impaired. Further characterization of this inhibitory factor is under way.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Introduction:? Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO?) plays an important role in wound healing. Not only does it possess cytotoxic properties, but also regulatory functions on various cells involved in inflammation and proliferation. In wounds, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) catalyzes arginine to citrulline and NO?, whereas arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular proliferation and repair. A model for regulation of wound healing proposes the importance of a strict reciprocal control of these enzymes in wounds. Human studies using impaired wound healing models, however, are lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate arginine metabolism in wound fluids of patients with pressure ulcers on Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy. Methods:? Wound fluid extracts from 11 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcer were analyzed for cytokines and metabolites of arginine. Sample age ranged from 31?92 years. Wound fluid was collected prior to V.A.C.? application and post-V.A.C.? within 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. Subjects served as their own control in this quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Spectrophotometric quantification of nitrates and nitrites using the Griess diazotization reaction method was performed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and proline were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results:? There was no significant differences between pre- and post-V.A.C.? concentrations of NO?, citrulline, ornithine, and proline. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in arginine levels measured at baseline and day'3 of V.A.C.? treatment. Also, NO? measured at 24 hours of V.A.C.? placement decreased significantly at day 7 of therapy. Furthermore, post-V.A.C.? levels of TNF-α decreased significantly from baseline. A less cytotoxic environment is created, thus indicating a healing wound following 1 week of V.A.C.? therapy. Discussion:? Arginine and its metabolites are detectable in wound fluids from patients with pressure ulcers. To our knowledge, the metabolism of arginine has not been described in human subjects with pressure ulcers on V.A.C.? therapy. The determination of NO? in these wound environments provides baseline information on the mechanisms involved in aberrant wound healing.

AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - The inflammatory phase of wound healing performs vital acts of host defense, removing invading microorganisms and or devitalized tissue. Characterized by an infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes, within hours of injury inflammation begins to effectively clear the wound in a strictly regulated manner in preparation for the following stages of repair and regeneration. Chronic wounds are varied in their etiology, resulting from many underlying pathologies. However, collectively they are often described as being in a persistent state of inflammation. Production of proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this unregulated manner can cause significant damage. By stopping the action of proinflammatory cytokines, further recruitment of neutrophils may be diminished, helping to stop protease production at its source. Chronic wound dressings that are able to help interrupt the self- perpetuating process may help to create the optimal wound healing environment. In this study we investigated the impact of silver and then an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccarhide (LPS) stimulated monocyte macrophages (THP-1 cells), an in vitro model of inflammation. The ability of the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC matrix to quench free radicals was also investigated. Results show that the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is capable of reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This dressing also has antioxidant activity, quenching ROS. These influences on the biochemistry of a chronic wound may have an antiinflammatory action, limiting the destruction of new tissue and promoting wound closure.

AB  - Chronic wounds fail to heal in the timely, ordered continuum demonstrated by acute wounds. The hostile biochemical environment of the chronic wound is one of the well-documented differences, which is thought to be responsible for the delay in healing. Overproduction of proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, are thought to destroy essential wound healing components including growth factors, shifting the balance in favor of tissue destruction rather than deposition. Chronic wound management must, therefore, aim to restore a more normal local wound environment. In wounds with an imbalance in bioburden, the origin of destructive proteolytic enzymes may be bacterial as well as host. Therefore, treatment to achieve a biochemical balance may need to address, not only, the level of microorganism, but also, the virulent factors they produce. An ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC addresses the wound micro'environment specifically targeting excess proteases. In this study we investigated the effect of ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on serine and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as, its ability to preserve growth factors, as exem'plified by Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) from host and bacterial 'proteolytic degradation. The ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC inactivated serine and matrix metalloproteinases from chronic wound fluids, as well as the proteolytic enzymes present in bacterial supernatants. It is also capable of preserving PDGF from proteolytic degradation. When compared to other commonly used wound dressings this is a unique characteristic of ORC/collagen, demonstrating their exclusive ability to absorb noxious components of wound fluid and restore a more normal wound healing environment.

AB  - Charcoal-based odor-absorbing dressings for management of odiferous chronic wounds have been marketed for many years. However, the presence of wound serum deactivates the charcoal and inhibits the adsorption of odor molecules. Charcoal dressings also generally need adjunct fixation to hold them in place. Avery Dennison Medical has developed a new series of hydrocolloid adhesives that provides an alternative technology for the adsorption of chronic wound odors. Dressings incorporating this technology are suitable for direct wound contact. In presence of serum, superior odor absorption with these new 'materials in comparison with charcoal dressings has been demonstrated in vitro. These new dressings have significant fluid absorption potential, are self-adhesive, and require no additional fixation. Some of the factors affecting performance of these new materials in vitro will be presented, as well as preliminary results from in vivo performance on chronic wounds. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - We have developed a human fetal digit model of response to tip amputation to simulate the clinical phenomenon of digit tip regrowth or regeneration in children. We reported previously that younger estimated gestational age (EGA) digits respond to tip amputation with several layers of cells covering the phalangeal anlage, compared to older digits where such coverage comprises fewer cell layers or is absent. The proximal cut end of excised digits does not demonstrate such a response. We report here that the transcription repressor MSX1 is expressed beneath the developing nailfield in younger human fetal digits (57 to 67 days EGA), as has been shown in the mouse, and that cells expressing MSX1 are found at the digit tip by 4 days postamputation. Further, expression of keratins K14 and K19 is found, suggesting reforming of an epithelium. These findings are consistent with the mouse model of digit tip regeneration where MSX1-expressing cells are hypothesized to migrate to the amputation site and reconstitute the missing tip, and with the general observation that a wound epidermis is required for either regeneration or wound healing. 57?d EGA digits; left, MSX1 expression, control; left center, MSX1 and center, K19 expression, day 4 posttip amputation; right center, MSX1 and right, K19 expression, day 7 postamputation

AB  - Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has found substantial clinical utility as a commercially available wound matrix. In the present study, the utility of two natural, nonsynthetic and noncrosslinked ECMs, porcine renal capsule material (RCM) and SIS, were compared to no-fill controls in a rat full thickness skin wound model. Groups of rats had surgically created wounds filled with SIS, RCM, or left unfilled (ten/treatment/time point). Wound diameters periodically measured at 3?30 days after wound creation and sites sampled at 3?56 days after wound creation were numerically graded for degree of histologic change including the formation of adnexa and for collagen content based on intensity of trichrome staining. Wounds in both ECM groups had statistically significant (P?<?0.001) greater wound diameters than unfilled controls at days 7, 12, and 17 with no differences between RCM- and SIS-treated wounds at any time point. At 56 days, SIS-filled and RCM-filled wounds were completely closed with cornified epithelium covered by a keratinized layer. Healing was largely complete, with normal numbers of adnexal structures present in most sections, while unfilled control wounds were similar though fewer adnexal structures were present. Though histology scores suggested more robust healing with either RCM or SIS, no significant differences with unfilled control wounds were found. From this study, it appears that RCM and SIS enhance wound healing in terms of wound tissue collagenization and maturation of adnexal structures while clearly impeding wound contraction. Natural ECMs have utility for dermal wound repair and may lessen clinical contracture formation caused by rapid wound contraction. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - There are only a few models for studying epidermal migration in vitro, and their interpretation is made difficult by reliance on cell monolayers and the choice of a specific substrate. In this study, the process of keratinocyte migration and epiboly were investigated by using a bilayered bioengineered skin construct, consisting of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (Apligraf, Organogenesis, Canton, MA). At baseline, 6-mm punch biopsies of the construct were placed in serum-free media (AIM-V) or DMEM with or without 10% FBS. At varying time points the bioengineered skin samples were processed and analyzed by histology and immunostaining. By 72 hours, in a time-dependent manner, the epidermis had migrated over and enveloped the entire dermis (full epiboly). Full epiboly was partially inhibited by serum and was maximal in serum-free medium. Epiboly was preserved 5 days after stated expiration date and was equivalent to that seen in unexpired construct when stored at room temperature. The process of epiboly was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by neutralizing antibodies to EGF and TGF-beta 1. The migrating epithelium was characterized by decreased keratinocyte proliferation (as per Ki67 immunostaining) and increased expression of vitronectin (epibolin). Increasing concentrations of antibodies of vitronectin blocked the process of epiboly, as did antibodies to the alpha5-betaV integrin receptor, which mediates vitronectin-driven keratinocyte locomotion. Interesting, epiboly was also blocked by preseeding human dermal fibroblasts on the dermal side of the construct. We propose that the process of epiboly in this model can be used to better understand and assess the mechanisms involved in keratinocyte migration and may be used as an assay for establishing construct functional viability.

AB  - We find that the ELR-negative CXC chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11(IP-9), expressed during wound repair, with IP-9 being produced by redifferentiated keratinocyte. Immunohistochemical analysis for IP-9 on human full thickness wound tissues collected from day 5 confirmed that IP-9 is a wound response protein. We have shown in in vitro coculture systems that IP-9 can serve as an autocrine factor promoting motility in keratinocyte while limiting motility in dermal fibroblasts. These effects occur via modulation of the intracellular proteases calpain isoforms that regulate cell adhesion during motility. Thus, the function of these chemokines in vivo is not obvious. To probe this, we have explored wound repair in mice lacking the receptor for these ligands, CXCR3. Quantitative analysis of IP-9 expression in wounds of these mice collected from day 2 to day 20 showed a significant increase in IP-9 levels in CXCR3-/- mice compared to wild type, which is expected if receptor-mediated feedback attenuation is lost. Full and partial thickness wound healing experiments on these mice showed a significant delay in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Histochemical analysis of tissues collected from both full and partial thickness wounds demonstrated differences in epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and angiogenesis in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Collagen, the major extracellular matrix protein organization were analyzed by trichrome and picrosirus red staining methods. We are also examining the effect of this lost receptor on promotility signaling from EGF receptors. These in vivo and in vitro studies confirm the pathophysiologic role of the chemokines IP-9 and IP-10 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 during wound repair.
