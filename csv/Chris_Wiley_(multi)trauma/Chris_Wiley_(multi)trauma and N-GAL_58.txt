AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Fibrin clot formation during normal wound healing is essential to hemostasis. Fibrin clots also serve as a scaffold for cells, such as fibroblasts, invading the wound bed. The mechanical characteristics of this fibrin ? fibroblast tissue over a period of time, as the fibrin is replaced with collagen, is not well understood. In this paper, we attempt to measure specific mechanical characteristics in these systems over a period of 10 days by using fibrin ? fibroblasts constructs prepared in a culture dish. We have also examined the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final fibrin clot on these characteristics. A well-established indentation protocol was used to determine the nominal elastic modulus of the cell-fibrin constructs at specified time points. Human fibroblast cell line CRL-2522 was used. Fibrin clots with different fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were prepared as described in Cox et al. (Tissue Engineering, Vol. 10 (5/6): 942) with cell concentration of 50,000 fibroblasts per fibrin clot. Four constructs were prepared for each of the following days 1, 5, and 10. 1?mL of a serum ? containing medium was added to each well, and plates were transferred to a 5% CO2 incubator at 37?°C. On days 1, 5, and 10, the fibrin ? fibroblast constructs were subject to a compressive indentation protocol. This involved applying a circular, flat-ended silica indenter to the surface of the cell/fibrin constructs through controlled displacements until reaching a specified maximum displacement, u*. An Instron 3365 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 2.5?N load cell with a load resolution of 0.1?mN was used. Displacement rates in the range of 5?10?mm/min were used with peak displacements, u*?=?0.1?5?mm. The force required to maintain these displacements was automatically recorded and analyzed for indentation stiffness over the fixed displacement range of 1.0?1.5?mm at 50?msec intervals. Our results indicate that for the unpopulated fibrin, there was a linear (R?=?0.983) relationship between the indentation stiffness and fibrinogen concentration. Also, there was a nonlinear relationship between indentation stiffness and concentration of collagen in the fibrin/collagen constructs. Finally, we found in one of the cell-populated formulations a steady decrease in the indentation stiffness with increasing incubation time (1?10 days), suggesting that the cells exerted a significant effect on the construct structure and hence mechanical function.

AB  - Wound healing involves many cell types whose functions are dependent upon the coordinated production of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Recent data show that behavioral stress disrupts the cytokine profile and slows wound closure. For example, in mice, restraint stress (RST) suppressed IL-1?, PDGF, and MCP-1 production, and delayed healing of a 3.5?mm circular wound by more than 3 days. The RST-induced delay in healing was due, in part, to elevated glucocorticoids (GC) and could be blocked by administration of the androgen hormone, androstenediol (AED). Therefore, it was hypothesized that AED would antagonize GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level, prevent RST-mediated/GC-dependent suppression of cytokine expression at the tissue level, and restore healing to that of controls. Total wound RNA was collected after injury, cDNA was synthesized, and real-time PCR was used to quantify IL-1? RNA as a measure of proinflammatory gene expression and I?Bα RNA as a measure of NF-?B transcriptional activation. Compared to controls, RST delayed wound closure (P?<?0.001) and decreased IL-1?(P?=?0.021) and I?Bα expression within 12?24 hours of wounding (P?=?0.021). In contrast, treatment of RST animals with AED restored IL-1? gene expression and restored wound closure to that of controls. Additionally, AED enhanced I?Bα RNA postinjury (P?<?0.001) suggestive of enhanced NF-?B activation. Because of the macrophage?s ability to coordinate inflammatory responses during healing, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were used to examine modulation of NF-?B activity in AED and GC-treated cells. The data showed that dexamethasone blocked translocation of active p65 which correlated with diminished cytokine gene expression. In contrast, AED restored cytokine gene expression and nuclear p65 levels in GC-treated cultures. In sum, these data suggest that AED antagonized GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level and restored cutaneous wound healing to that of unstressed controls.

AB  - Background:? Activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been linked to dermal wound healing in fetal and adult tissue. Activation of this pathway has been previously linked to interleukin (IL)-1? expression. This study addresses the mechanism by which IL-1? regulates both production of and response to PGE2 in cultured human fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts. Hypothesis:? IL-1? regulates fetal and adult dermal fibroblast PGE2 signaling. Methods:? Fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts were isolated from human skin explants. Secretion of soluble mediators was assayed using ELISA kits. Expression of COX-2 as well as the various PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4) was analyzed at both the mRNA and protein levels. Results:? Compared to adult fibroblasts, fetal fibroblasts produced decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but similar levels of PGE2. IL-1?1 caused up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. However, administration of IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor-α or interferon-? did not significantly alter the mRNA or protein levels of any PGE2 receptor subtype. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results. IL-1? causes up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts, but does not alter the expression of PGE2 receptors. Therefore, proinflammatory mediator-induced changes in both fetal and adult skin fibroblasts appear to act through increased production of the signal molecules and not through increased or altered receptor expression for PGE2. This finding raises the possibility of increased autocrine signaling in the context of dermal inflammation, such as that associated with a wound healing response. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Objective:? Following tissue vascular and oxygen delivery disruption, normal wound healing is a complex process requiring restoration of supplies of oxygen and other nutrients through blood vessel regeneration, or angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is stimulated by synergistic interactions of growth factors and cytokines secreted by damaged cells in wound tissues exhibiting hypoxia, high lactate levels, and inflammation. Chronic wounds, often complications of diabetes, are characterized by chronic hypoxia, inflammation, and insufficient growth factor secretion. To test growth factor sensitivity to reversed hypoxia in chronic human wounds, we administered pure oxygen topically to chronic foot ulcers in diabetic humans and used molecular probes to measure growth factors previously found to regulate angiogenesis and improve delayed healing, i.e., VEGF et?al. Methods:? By multiplex ELISA assays of growth factor cytokines, we quantified pg/ug levels of total proteins detectable in fluids collected from human diabetic plantar wounds after exposure to topical oxygen delivered in 0?50?mm?Hg pulses during 90-minute treatments 4 days per week over a 5 week protocol. Wounds that had failed to heal for at least 4 weeks were infused with a maximum of 1.06 ATM of oxygen at 1 minute intervals in a lower limb enclosing chamber. Findings:? Our initial data show increased expression in angiogenesis-related growth factors (bFGF, HB-EGF, HGF, KGF, VEGF) in wound fluid from chronic diabetic foot ulcers using the Topical Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber (Advanced Hyperbaric Technologies, Inc., Farmingdale, NJ). Secretion of the most crucial angiogenic factor, VEGF, was increased by 8-fold to well over 10-fold using the described protocol. Conclusions:? These data show evidence of a molecular mechanism for the scientific basis of topical hyperbaric oxygen-modulated growth factor expression in chronic diabetic wounds, previously unresponsive to standard wound care. We conclude that topically applied hyperbaric oxygen alters angiogenesis-related growth factor expression in wound fluids from chronic diabetic foot ulcers in a manner consistent with renewed healing.
