AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish an in vitro model that permits in vitro infection of bovine skin with Treponema spp. and enables to study the role of treponemes in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis (DD). In all experiments, incubation with T. denticola or T. brennaborense was carried out simultaneously. Keratinocytes obtained from the claw were cultivated on cover glasses without antibiotics until they reached sub-confluence. Then they were incubated with OMIZ Pat medium containing treponemes for up to 96?h. Every 24?h two cover glasses were fixed and stained with the DAPI method. Skin explants were obtained from typical sites of DD lesions. First the explants were maintained in medium with antibiotics to eliminate bacterial contamination. Subsequently, they were rinsed thoroughly with medium without antibiotics and incubated with Treponema suspensions for 48?h. The treponemes stayed vital under culture conditions for even up to 96?h. They were still showing their typical spiral shaped morphology and adhered to the cultured keratinocytes at all time points. With prolonged incubation time cultured cells began to show morphologic damage and some cells detached from the cover glasses. Light and electron microscopical investigations of the explants revealed that treponemes were adhering to the surface of the epidermis. They were visible in often-enlarged intercellular spaces. In addition treponemes could be detected in deep epidermal layers and in very high concentrations in the dermis. In periodontal disease, spirochetes were observed in enlarged intercellular spaces. Our results support these findings suggesting that treponemes invade the deeper claw tissue via the intercellular spaces of the epidermis. We suggest that the enlargement of the intercellular spaces can improve an increased infection of deeper tissue layers and facilitates the way for infection with other anaerobic bacteria.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Physicians, policy makers, and other interested parties require a synthesized, critical, and clear compilation of the following information to optimize spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for neuropathic pain: 1) indications and potential beneficial outcomes; 2) answers to key clinical questions; 3) cost/resource use implications; and 4) the quality and source of the evidence. This information must be nonjudgmental and noncoercive and have the sole objective of increasing the reader's expertise. Study Design.? Evidence-based literature review and consensus statement. Methods.? We consulted with experts to identify clinical-practice questions. Then, we conducted a critical literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, 1967 through March 2007) to grade treatment practices from ?options? to ?recommended.? We created a bibliographical database of all citations pertinent to each practice question. Several experts not otherwise involved reviewed the draft document. Results.? We answered 64 questions covering 1) indications; 2) potential beneficial outcomes; 3) prognostic factors; 4) patient selection for screening trial; 5) procedural risk management; 6) screening trial; 7) device options; 8) patient management; 9) factors affecting the delivery and quality of SCS treatment; and 10) cost-effectiveness. Most of our more than 300 references are cited multiple times (in each pertinent category). This is the first overview that seeks to categorize and place the entire SCS clinical literature at the disposal of the reader. It presents the first grading system that incorporates, among other evidence sources, an assessment of the likelihood of a favorable outcome based on the evidence provided by expert consensus combined with consideration of the risk and potential benefit of an action. Conclusions.? The Practice Parameters for Spinal Cord Stimulation in the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain answers important questions. It assesses supporting evidence and provides specific citations to enable the reader to conduct further study. The document will be updated regularly in a Web-based version.

AB  - Introduction:? There are several proposed animal models of hypertrophic scarring. However, most are quite dissimilar from the actual human event. It has been shown that wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars. We are attempting to fully validate this model. A fourfold increase in mast cells and formation of collagen nodules have been described as characteristics of human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized the occurrence of nodules and mast cells in Duroc scars is similar. Methods:? For nodules, we biopsied human hypertrophic scars (47 cases) taken 5 to 67 months from injury and Duroc scars (six animals) taken 0 to 5 months from injury. For mast cells, we biopsied human hypertrophic scar (five cases) taken 24 to 30 months from injury and Duroc scars (five animals) taken 5 months from injury. We stained the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (nodules) and Giemsa (mast cells) and counted intact mast cells in the upper papillary dermis in 20 and recorded nodules as present or absent. Results:? The results are included the table below. Tissue Month n Nodules mean?±?SD P Duroc Scar ?0?3 10 ?0 ?4?5 ?6 50% NODULES Human Hypertrophic ?5?12 ?9 33% 12?24 22 36% 24?67 16 81% MAST CELLS Duroc Scar ?4?5 ?5 ?41?±?26 <.05 Duroc Uninjured ?5 ?18?±?9 Human Hypertrophic 24?30 ?5 251?±?139 <.01 Human Uninjured ?5 ?60?±?24 Conclusion:? Collagen nodules and increased numbers of mast cells are present in Duroc scar giving further validity to the female, red Duroc pig as an animal model of hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - Epithelialization and vascularization are key elements involved in the repair of cutaneous wounds. One method of regulation for these pathways is expression of a signaling molecule known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which, in turn, is regulated by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). It has been suggested that chronic wounds, which are most commonly located in ischemic tissue among the elderly, may be the result of a loss of function in the VEGF regulation pathway. Using our rat back flap model, which demonstrates the negative influences of age and ischemia on wound healing, we examined the relative expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in aged and young rats at 3,7, and 10 days post-wounding. Four full-thickness biopsy punches (7?mm) were made on the back of each aged and young rat. The rostral wound pair was made ischemic by raising a transverse flap (1.8?cm wide???8?cm length). The caudal wound pair served as a non-ischemic control. Inserting a sterilized polyethylene sheet under both ischemic and nonischemic wounds prevented wound contraction. RNA was extracted from the tissue at the specified time points, and run on Real-Time PCR to determine relative expression of VEGF and HIF-1. Preliminary data suggest that, at the 3 day time point, there is a significant increase in both HIF-1 and VEGF expression in young rats under ischemic conditions and a significant increase in VEGF expression in aged rats under ischemia with a strong (but not significant) trend towards increase in HIF-1 as well. While the rat model does not produce significant differences between aged and young animals, this upregulation under ischemia indicates that HIF-1 and VEGF expression may play a vital role in the early signaling of ischemic wound repair.

AB  - Abstract Observations made in the last few years support the existence of pathways, in adult humans and rodents, that allow adult stem cells to be surprisingly flexible in their differentiation repertoires. Termed plasticity, this property allows adult stem cells, assumed, until now, to be committed to generating a fixed range of progeny, to switch, when they have been relocated, to make other specialized sets of cells appropriate to their new niche. Reprogramming of some adult stem cells can occur in vivo; the stem cells normally resident in bone marrow appear particularly flexible and are able to contribute usefully to multiple recipient organs. This process produces cells with specialized structural and metabolic adaptations commensurate with their new locations. In a few examples, the degree of support is sufficient to assist or even rescue recipient mice from genetic defects. Some studies provide evidence for the expansion of the reprogrammed cells locally, but in most it remains possible that cells arrive and redifferentiate, but are no longer stem cells. Nevertheless, the fact that appropriately differentiated cells are delivered deep within organs simply by injection of bone marrow cells should make us think differently about the way that organs regenerate and repair. Migratory pathways for stem cells in adult organisms may exist that could be exploited to effect repairs using an individual's own stem cells, perhaps after gene therapy. Logical extensions of this concept are that a transplanted organ would become affected by the genetic susceptibilities of the recipient, alleles that re-express themselves via marrow-derived stem cells, and that plasticity after bone marrow transplantation would also transfer different phenotypes, affecting important parameters such as susceptibility to long-term complications of diabetes, or the ability to metabolize drugs in the liver. This article reviews some of the evidence for stem cell plasticity in rodents and man. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Calreticulin (CRT) is a major classic Ca-binding chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, CRT has been recognized to have widespread extracellular effects as well. In the current study we show that CRT increases both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of porcine and murine wound repair. Partial thickness wounds were created on the paravertebral area of pigs (n?=?4) and 0.1% and 0.5% CRT, and PDGF (positive control) applied for 4 consecutive days. In wounds harvested at 5 days, CRT induced a 28 and 22% greater extent of reepithelialization than PDGF and Tris/Ca buffer control, respectively (% healed?=?56/CRT; 40.5/PDGF; 44/control). In addition, CRT stimulated earlier granulation tissue formation in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative dermal depth, microns: 1615/CRT; 1250/PDGF; 1325/control). A similar granulation tissue inducing effect of CRT was also observed in a steroid-impaired pig model. As a diabetic model of wound repair, two 5?mm circular full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db mice; the wounds were splinted open with silicone rings and covered with occlusive dressing (n?=?24). After 5 days of treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 5% CRT, a dose-dependent 8-, 4.5-, and 2-fold increase in granulation tissue formation was observed (p?<?0.05). However, there was no apparent effect on wound closure. Tissue sections showed a highly cellular dermis in the CRT treated wounds. In addition, CRT (50?pg/ml) stimulated wound closure in a scratch plate assay using fibroblasts by 45%, in 48?hrs, compared to 2% for the control. Therefore, CRT may be a novel agent for wound healing by acting as a chemoattractant for cells involved in wound remodeling and in epithelial migration. Suppported by Calretex, LLC.

AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - The arterial system of the gills of carp and its histological structure were studied light and electron microscopically by making Mercox or Neoplane Latex corrosion cast preparations. Four pairs of afferent and efferent branchial arteries, and a pair of afferent and efferent pseudobranchial arteries were identified in the branchial arterial system. The 1st and 2nd afferent branchial arteries are given off directly from the ventral aorta, and the 3rd and 4th afferent arteries originate from their common trunk, which is branched off from the ventral aorta caudal to the origin of the former branchial arteries. Numerous afferent filamental arteries are connected to the lamellar blood capillary networks in the gill lamellae via afferent lamellar arterioles, and efferent filamental arteries followed the efferent lamellar arterioles are converged into four efferent branchial arteries that are connected to the dorsal aorta. To the pseudobranchia, afferent pseudobranchial arteries are connected with the ventral branches of the 1st efferent branchial arteries to provide arterial blood to the organ through the afferent mandibular arteries. Afferent pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles originating from the afferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the blood capillary networks in the pseudobranchial lamellae, and blood in the capillary networks is drained into the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries via 2-4 pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles. Branches of the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the arteries to the eyeballs and provide blood to choroid of the vascular tunic of them. Pseudobranchial cells surrounding lamellar capillaries in the pseudobranchia are furnished with abundant mitochondria and tubular structures, and the histological findings suggest the cells may share an ability to exchange physiological materials between the cells and the blood in the capillary networks of pseudobranchia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the ultrastructure of three-dimensional keratinocyte colonies in relation to ex vivo bovine hoof epidermis. Keratinocytes were isolated from the claw and cultured in equal parts of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Taufkirchen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, Taufkirchen) and serum-free MCDB 153 complete medium (Biochrom, Berlin). Cells were allowed to grow until formation of colonies occurred. Then the colonies were isolated by removing the surrounding cells with a cell scraper every 3?days. The colonies were harvested when the reached diameters of 6?8?mm and were fixed in Karnovsky's solution. They were routinely processed for the embedding in Agar 100. Semithin and ultrathin sections were prepared and examined under the light and transmission electron microscope. These colonies revealed the morphological properties and tissue architecture, which are specific for claw epidermis in vivo. We detected up to 22 layers of keratinocytes and could discover between three stages of differentiation: a basal cell layer, followed by several cell layers corresponding morphologically to the cells of the stratum spinosum and a few cornified superficial cell layers. Throughout all layers cells were connected by desmosomes, which were linked to the cytoskeleton by dense bundles of filaments. In addition we observed the formation of desmosomes. The cells of the upper un-cornified layers generated an cornified envelope. In the following layers cell death and subsequent cornification accompanied by the characteristic alterations of the nuclei occurred. The cells at the superficial layers were filled by electron dense, solid horn masses. Additionally we detected intercellular cementing substance in the intercellular space between the upper layers. Our electron microscopical characterization of the colonies provides evidence that the bovine hoof keratinocytes invitro undergo basically a similar pattern of proliferation and differentiation like in the claw in vivo. These findings provided a basis for further studies like the long-term culture and differentiation of bovine hoof keratinocytes in perfusion chambers.

AB  - Introduction:? Today, the claims on the anatomical education have changed with the considerable increase of modern medical imaging. For the analysis of computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance (MR) images or ultrasound, the knowledge of cross sectional anatomy is an important prerequisite for proper diagnosis. Admittedly, it is difficult for students and also for practitioners to imagine three-dimensional objects in space. The possibilities and convenience of 3D-reconstructions were demonstrated by generating virtual casts of frontal sinuses. Methods:? Using a HiSpeed (DX/i Plus, General Electric) scanner transversal CT images of Persian and European Shorthair cats were acquired. The slice thickness and distance were set to 1?mm. With the software system VG Studio MAX 1.1, the obtained volumetric data was used to create volume graphics displaying object surfaces and interiors based on voxel data. Because of density value acquisition, it was possible to identify and label the objects of interest. The extension of the paranasal sinuses was analyzed and demonstrated in relation to the skull. For verification, conventional corrosion casting employing Technovit or Tensolcement, respectively, were carried out on the same specimens. Results:? The frontal sinuses of both feline breeds showed great variations in size, shape and symmetry. With models from the skull based on 3D-datasets including the virtual casts of the paranasal sinuses, it was easy to imagine spatial relations and localizations inside the head. The advantages of the virtually derived casting method are: creating the virtual casts in vivo; the method does not imply any health risks and is repeatedly applicable. Conclusion:? 3D-reconstructions based on CT-datasets are excellently suited for generating spatial sense. Additionally, a single scan series can be applied for different anatomical problems. The resulting digital 3D-objects are readily available and can be employed for educational purposes for better comprehension of the difficult spatial relations of the head.
