AB  - Abstract Background Water balance is achieved when water intake from solid and fluid foods and drinking water meets water losses, mainly in sweat, urine and faeces. Seasonality, particularly in Mediterranean countries that have a hot summer, may affect water loss and consequently water balance. Water balance has not been estimated before on a population level and the effect of seasonality has not been evaluated. The present study aimed to compare water balance, intake and loss in summer and winter in a sample of the general population in Greece. Methods The Water Balance Questionnaire (WBQ) was used to evaluate water balance, estimating water intake and loss in summer (n = 480) and in winter (n = 412) on a stratified sample of the general population in Athens, Greece. Results In winter, mean (SD) water balance was ?63 (1478) mL/day?1, mean (SD)water intake was 2892 (987) mL/day?1 and mean (quartile range) water loss was 2637 (1810?3922) mL/day?1. In summer, mean (SD) water balance was ?58 (2150) mL/day?1, mean (SD) water intake was 3875 (1373) mL/day?1 and mean (quartile range) water loss was 3635 (2365?5258) mL/day?1. Water balance did not differ between summer and winter (P = 0.96); however, the data distribution was different; in summer, approximately 8% more participants were falling in the low and high water balance categories. Differences in water intake from different sources were identified (P < 0.05). Conclusions Water balance in summer and winter was not different. However, water intake and loss were approximately 40% higher in summer than in winter. More people were falling in the low and high water balance categories in summer when comparing the distribution on water balance in winter.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate the prevalence and its clinical characteristics of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a specialized psoriasis clinic of a University Hospital. Methods In this retrospective study, 278 patients with psoriasis were evaluated between 2011 and 2013. Results The study included 278 patients with psoriasis: 144 (52%) were male and 134 (48%) female. Their median age was 51.41 with median psoriasis presenting age of 34.52 years. Referring to the type of psoriasis, 86% presented with plaque psoriasis, 5% guttate, 2% palms and soles, 2% inverse, 1% pustular and 4% with psoriasis of more than one type. Nail disease appeared in 121 patients (43.5%) and scalp disease in 175 (63%). Of these patients, 85 (30%) had PsA, whereas 51% of patients with PsA had psoriatic nail disease. With reference to the PsA type, 43 (51%) patients presented with polyarthritis, 10 (12%) with oligoarthritis, 7 (8%) with axial arthritis, whereas the rest 25 of them (31%) had PsA of more than one type. The subgroup of patients with PsA had significantly higher rates of comorbidities including arterial hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia compared to non-PsA patients with 41% vs. 17% (P = 0.001), 20% vs. 8% (P = 0.021) and 41% vs. 19% (P = 0.004), respectively. Conclusion The prevalence of PsA among patients with psoriasis was relatively higher in Greece compared to other ethnic-based studies. Comorbidities related to life expectancy were more frequent. As there is a high percentage of undiagnosed cases with active arthritis among patients with psoriasis, dermatologists should be aware of PsA clinical signs in order to recognize it earlier and provide successful treatment.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to assess the lifetime cost effectiveness of recombinant activated factor VII vs placebo as adjunctive therapy for control of bleeding in patients with severe blunt trauma in the UK. We developed a cost-effectiveness model based on patient level data from a 30-day international, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase II trial. The data were supplemented with secondary data from UK sources to estimate lifetime costs and benefits. The model produced a baseline estimate of the incremental cost per life year gained with recombinant activated factor VII relative to placebo of £12?613. The incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained was £18?825. These estimates are sensitive to the choice of discount rate and health state utility values used. Preliminary results suggest that relative to placebo, recombinant activated factor VII may be a cost-effective therapy to the UK National Health Service.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are soluble proteins produced by leukocytes and other cell types, which act as chemical communicators between cells and tissues within the body. These proteins mediate a number of functions, ranging from effects on cell growth, differentiation, survival, and a number of effector activities. The main purpose of this unit is to provide an easy-to-use reference summarizing some of the current information on well-established cytokine, growth factore, and chemokine ligands. The information provided is confined largely to alternative names, protein properties, genetic chracteristics, chromosomal localization, cellular expression patters, cellular-tissue targets, stimuli regulating expression, functional properties, expression analysis, and clinical utility.

AB  - Background: In the past few decades, more patients have been treated orthodontically, but no longitudinal study has compared orthodontic bands and brackets microbiologically and clinically. Methods: This longitudinal trial (split-mouth design) included 24 patients. Microbiology (sub- and supragingival), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and gingival crevicular fluid flow (GCF) were assessed at baseline (band placement) and at weeks 18 (bracket bonding) 20, 24, and 36. A statistical comparison was made over time and among the banded, bonded, and control sites. Results: The aerobe/anaerobe ratio of sub- and supragingival colony forming units decreased significantly (relatively more anaerobes) over the study period for the banded and bonded sites (P <0.001). This decrease was accompanied by significant elevations in PD, BOP, and GCF. These changes occurred faster after bonding compared to banding. No significant changes were observed 18 weeks after banding with the exception of increased PD (P <0.001). At week 36, all microbial and clinical variables at the bonded site had changed significantly in the negative direction (P <0.001) compared to week 18. The control sites did not show any significant changes over time, indicating that the effects were localized. Conclusions: The placement of fixed orthodontic appliances had a significant impact on microbial and clinical variables. The changes occurred faster at the bonded sites compared to the banded sites, probably because wire insertion caused difficulties in approximal cleaning. Over the long term, banding did not lead to more adverse microbial and periodontal effects than bonding.

AB  - Abstract Beta-thalassaemia is characterised by progressive anaemia necessitating regular blood transfusions to sustain life. With the advent of effective chelating agents that can reduce the iron burden and extend patients' survival, renal disease, as in other ageing populations, has become more prevalent. In recent years, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become overwhelming; indeed, approximately 8% or 6 million people of the UK population has evidence of CKD. Several factors, which occur in patients with thalassaemia, account for the relative explosion of renal disease in the general population including increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and the advent of novel measures of renal function facilitating early detection of kidney disease. In addition, some patients with thalassaemia develop renal tubular dysfunction related to the disease itself, the effects of iron overload and the effects of chelator therapy, while other patients have an increased creatinine clearance leading to hyperfiltration. More recently, there is a noticeable increasing prevalence of impaired renal function and proteinuria because of several putative factors including chelators. We review current data on the potential mechanisms leading to renal abnormalities seen in patients with thalassaemia, the potential effects of iron loading within the kidney and the potential renal effects of chelator therapy. This article gives a speculative account of possible mechanisms and theories to consider providing pause for thought and direct future research in this area.

AB  - Summary Bacterial infections associated with multidrug resistance are among the leading causes of death and represent a major threat to the human health of the new millennium. Several pathogenic bacteria have become resistant to several antibiotic classes, and strains resistant to all available antibiotics already exist. Therefore, in an era of the rise of multidrug-resistant superbugs, and where solutions are becoming scarce, there is an urgent need to find alternative and effective antibacterial agents. Bacteriophages, the viruses of microbes, due to their bacterial predatory nature represent a natural toolbox on promising antibacterial proteins. Here, we describe the most promising proteins (virion-associated lysins [VALs], endolysins, polysaccharide depolymerases, and holins) that can be used to treat bacterial infections, including those associated with high antibiotic resistance. The biological features and studies that demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of these enzymes on pathogens are demonstrated. The VALs and endolysins are enzymes with the ability to degrade the bacterial peptidoglycan (thereby compromising and lysing the cells) and are the most well-studied phage proteins with several successful studies reported in vitro and in vivo. There are however other promising phage-derived enzymes that target bacteria with a different mode of action. Polysaccharide depolymerases do not kill bacteria, but instead degrade their extracellular polymers that protect the cells from the environment. They have been found to be particularly useful to control bacterial infections in cooperation with the host immune system. Finally, the holins are also emerging as a new class of antibacterials. These enzymes permeabilize the inner bacterial membranes making holes on them, and although only few reports have demonstrated its antibacterial activity, their potential use as therapeutic agents is expected to be high. This chapter demonstrates the hidden antimicrobial potential of the phage proteome, with specific examples of phage-derived proteins that can be used to control drug-resistant bacterial infections.

AB  - The initial mineralization centers during human bone formation onto osteoblasts are composed of CaCO3. Those bioseeds are enzymatically formed via carbonic anhydrase(s) in close association with the cell surface of the osteoblasts. Subsequently, the bicarbonate/carbonate anions are exchanged non-enzymatically by inorganic phosphate [Pi]. One source for the supply of Pi is polyphosphate [polyP] which is a physiological polymer, formed in the osteoblasts as well as in the platelets. The energy-rich acid anhydride bonds within the polyP chain are cleaved by phosphatase(s); during this reaction free-energy might be released that could be re-used, as metabolic fuel, for the maintenance of the steady-state concentrations of the substrates/products during mineralization. Finally it is outlined that polyP, as a morphogenetically active scaffold, is even suitable for 3D cell printing.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - ABSTRACT? The intention of this review is to stress new information regarding the quite versatile functions of Kupffer cells. Although their main function is phagocytosis and defence of the liver against bacteria, endotoxaemia and viral infections, they also fulfil other important roles. They will phagocytose and partially degrade bacterial antigens before handing them on to the hepatocytes for excretion into the bile. They handle LDL lipoproteins, whilst the HDL proceed directly into the hepatocytes. They produce lymphokine mediators that direct protein synthesis by the hepatocytes. Also they normally produce prostaglandins that are cyto-protective for the hepatocytes. Conversely, if they are required to attack infected hepatocytes or cancer cells, then they switch to the production of leukotrienes. Thus they function as specialised macrophages, and it is not surprising that other ?activated macrophages? have to be recruited into the liver to support them in inflammatory reactions.

Firmicutes / ?Bacilli? / Bacillales / Bacillaceae / Bacillus Cells rod-shaped, straight or slightly curved, occurring singly and in pairs, some in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Endospores are formed, no more than one to a cell; these spores are very resistant to many adverse conditions. Gram-positive, or Gram-positive only in early stages of growth, or Gram-negative. A meso-DAP direct murein cross-linkage type is commonest, but L-Lys-D-Glu, Orn-D-Glu and L-Orn-D-Asp have occasionally been reported. Motile by means of peritrichous or degenerately peritrichous flagella, or nonmotile. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but a few species are described as strictly anaerobic. The terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, replaceable by alternatives in some species. Most species will grow on routine media such as nutrient agar and blood agar. Colony morphology and size very variable between and within species. A wide diversity of physiological abilities is exhibited, ranging from psychrophilic to thermophilic, and acidophilic to alkaliphilic; some strains are salt tolerant and some are halophilic. Catalase is produced by most species. Oxidase-positive or -negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultative chemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiring several growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates. DNA G + C content (mol%): 32?66 (Tm ). Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.

Depending on the growth medium, cells occur singly or in pairs with a gullwing appearance. Gram-stain-negative or Gram-stain-variable. Cells are motile by means of multiple subpolar flagella (exact numbers are yet to be determined, but are thought to be between one and eight), and possess a multi-layered Gram-stain-positive cell-wall type. Endospores are not formed. Anaerobic, growing best in an enriched CO2 atmosphere. Some strains become aerotolerant after several passages, being able to grow in a partially reduced atmosphere containing 5% O2. Optimum growth at 35?37°C, with no or poor growth at 20, 43, or 45°C. Growth is stimulated by horse or rabbit serum and by whole blood. Growth is not stimulated by formate/fumarate. Slow growth on solid media. After 3 d incubation at 37°C, colonies on peptone/yeast extract/glucose/sheep blood or Columbia agar supplemented with human blood are pin-point to 1 mm in diameter. After 5 d, the colonies are larger, 1?2.5 mm in diameter, and gray-white or slightly yellowish. Cells are killed by heating at 55°C for 15 minutes. Oxidase- and catalase-negative. Weakly (terminal pH 5.5?6.5) or strongly (terminal pH <5.5) saccharolytic. Fermentation products include acetic and succinic acids, with or without lactic acid, when grown in peptone/yeast extract/glucose medium. Propionic acid is not produced. Do not produce acid from L-arabinose, D-arabitol, lactose, mannitol, methyl-?-D-galactopyranoside, or sorbitol. Negative for alkaline phosphatase, α-arabinosidase, chymotrypsin, ?-galactosidase-6-phosphate, ?-glucosidase, trypsin, and urease (RapID 32Strep), cysteine arylamidase, lipase (C14), α-mannosidase, ?-mannosidase, N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase, glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid, and valine arylamidase activity. Variable activity for phenylalanine arylamidase (weak- to strong-positive reaction). Acid phosphatase- and pyrollydonyl arylamidase-negative. Acetoin is not produced. Gelatin is not hydrolyzed. Nitrate may be reduced. Sensitive to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, clindamycin, gentamicin, imipenem, moxalactam, penicillin G, rifampin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, and virginiamycin. Resistant to colistin, cycloserine, nalidixic acid, neomycin, and mezlocillin. Associated with the human vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis (BV).
