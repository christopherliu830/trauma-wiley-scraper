AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Background Tetrastarch can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) in humans with sepsis, but less likely to result in tissue edema than lactated Ringer's solution (LRS). Objectives Compare effects of volume replacement (VR) with LRS and 6% tetrastarch solution (TS) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) and markers of AKI in hemorrhaged dogs. Animals Six healthy English Pointer dogs (19.7?35.3 kg). Methods Prospective crossover study. Animals underwent anesthesia without hemorrhage (Control). Two weeks later, dogs hemorrhaged under anesthesia on 2 occasions (8-week washout intervals) and randomly received VR with LRS or TS at 3 : 1 or 1 : 1 of shed blood, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained until 4 hour after VR for EVLW measurements derived from transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine concentrations in plasma and urine were measured until 72 hour after VR. Results The EVLW index (mL/kg) was lower at 1 hour after TS (10.0 ± 1.9) in comparison with controls (11.9 ± 3.4, P = 0.04), and at 4 hour after TS (9.7 ± 1.9) in comparison with LRS (11.8 ± 2.7, P = 0.03). Arterial oxygen partial pressure-to-inspired oxygen fraction ratio did not differ among treatments from 0.5 to 4 hour after VR. Urine NGAL/creatinine ratio did not differ among treatments and remained below threshold for AKI (120,000 pg/mg). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Although TS causes less EVLW accumulation than LRS, neither fluid produced evidence of lung edema (impaired oxygenation). Both fluids appear not to cause AKI when used for VR after hemorrhage in healthy nonseptic dogs.

AB  - Abstract Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a condition that can develop in about half of the patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower limbs. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the early phases of DVT and their correlation with the onset of PTS. Patients were enrolled after the first episode of DVT and were followed up for 1, 4, 8, 12 and 18 months. At each visit, blood sample was collected to evaluate plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1,-2,-3,-7,-8 and -9 MMP inhibitors, TIMP-1,-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Analysis included 201 patients [86 males (42·79%) and 115 females (57·21%); average age 56 ± 7 years]. Of the 201 patients, 47 (23·38%; 21 males, 26 females) developed PTS during the follow-up period. The control group was made up of 60 individuals without DVT (22 males and 38 females). High plasma levels of MMPs, NGAL and cytokines were recorded during the acute phase after DVT. Moreover, patients with PTS showed higher levels of MMP-1 and MMP-8 with respect to patients without PTS. There is a close relationship between DVT, the individual risk of PTS and specific biomarkers such as MMPs and other related molecules, which may help guide prevention and therapy based on the patient's individual risk profile, and has to be studied in future.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF), a clinical syndrome associated with a dismal prognosis, occurs acutely in patients with chronic liver disease. An important feature of this syndrome is the potential for reversibility if it is recognized early and supportive measures are instituted before multi-organ failure ensues. There have therefore been recent efforts to better define and understand the pathophysiologic basis of the condition so as to aid early diagnosis and management. In this chapter, we aim to review the most recent data on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and management of ACLF.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.
