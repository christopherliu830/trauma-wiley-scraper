AB  - Inflammatory cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical step in the response to diverse insults, including infection, trauma and infarction, as well as immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite considerable advances in understanding immune surveillance and antigen recognition in the CNS, the signals resulting in parenchymal inflammation are incompletely understood. Members of a novel family of chemo-attractant cytokines, the chemokines, are made in the CNS and are emerging as likely mediators of inflammatory cell migration into the CNS.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Introduction Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology is a major diagnostic method for detecting exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) and inflammatory airway disease (IAD) in racehorses. Our hypothesis was that training and racing would increase the incidence of IAD and EIPH. Methods On three different occasions (day-1, ?30 and ?60), BAL fluid was obtained from both lungs of 14 Standardbred trotters with similar age and training level. Cytological inclusion criteria were neutrophils >10%, and/or mast cells ≥5%, and/or eosinophils ≥5% for IAD, and haemosiderophage/macrophage (H/M) ratio >20% for EIPH. Since previously found not to be equivalent, both samples from each horse were independently investigated. Horse status (?IAD?,?EIPH?, ?mixed?, or ?control?) at each time point was based on cytological profiles from both lungs. Cell proportions were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Haemosiderophage proportions and H/M were significantly higher on day-60 compared to day-1. No significant difference was observed for other cell proportions. On day-1, 5 horses were ?control?, 2 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-30, 3 horses were ?control?, 4 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH?, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-60, 3 horses were ?control?, 0 ?IAD?, 3 ?EIPH?, and 8 ?mixed?. Despite the different horses? distribution within each category, an overall increase in EIPH was observed. Five of the 7 horses classified ?control? or ?IAD? on day-1 presented EIPH on day-30 and/or ?60. EIPH was detected in 11/14 horses (78.6%) on day-60, versus 7/14 horses (50%) on day-1. Conclusions The incidence of EIPH, but not IAD, significantly increased during a racing season. This evolution should be considered when assessing BAL fluid cytology in racehorses. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the regional Animal Ethics Committee (n°CEEA.2012.179) and all owners signed a consent form. Sources of funding:?IFCE (National Studs) and SECF (French Trotters Racing Association). Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic and poly-aetiological autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies to autologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. The defective clearance of apoptotic material, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), provides abundant chromatin or self-dsDNA to trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In SLE patients, the immune complex (IC) of dsDNA and its autoantibodies trigger the robust type I interferon (IFN-I) production through intracellular DNA sensors, which drives the adaptive immune system to break down self-tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the potential resources of self-dsDNA, the mechanisms of self-dsDNA-mediated inflammation through various DNA sensors and its functions in SLE pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Background: High levels of endotoxin in patients with cirrhosis are thought to be responsible for the activation of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF)-α-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways involved in haemodynamic alterations. Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) is a protein found in neutrophils with endotoxin-binding and neutralization capacity. It is not known whether defective BPI production or release is present in cirrhosis. Aims: We investigated the levels of BPI in cirrhotic patients and its relation to other endotoxin-binding proteins and inflammatory markers. Methods: Plasmatic levels of BPI, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, soluble CD14, TNF-α and BPI mRNA expression in neutrophils were determined in 130 patients and 30 healthy controls. The capacity of patients' plasma to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated TNF-α production by monocytes from healthy donors was assessed in vitro. Results: Patients with cirrhosis exhibited an increase in BPI mRNA and plasma level of BPI when compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Child C group displayed the highest frequency of patients with a high concentration of BPI. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and plasma levels of BPI (P<0.01). High levels of BPI in plasma were able to significantly reduce in vitro TNF-α release by monocytes after a challenge with LPS (8.54 ± 1.04 vs. 10.44 ± 0.85?pg/ml, P=0.028). Conclusion: BPI is increased in cirrhotic patients, especially in those with more severe liver disease. The amount of BPI in the plasma correlated with the TNF-α level and was able to reduce LPS-mediated TNF production by monocytes. BPI possibly plays a regulatory role by antagonizing the pro-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by TNF-α.

AB  - We report unique histologic findings in scalp biopsies from two family members with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. Rapp-Hodgkin and the related AEC syndrome show a primary scarring alopecia and pili torti. The syndromes, which are related to ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome, have been credited to mutations in the TP63 gene. Most notable on biopsy is a primary scarring alopecia and abnormal hair shaft shape. Calcification in the outer root sheath epithelium, the basement membrane of the lower segment and within naked hair shafts is present. Neutrophils and bacterial rods and cocci are adjacent to the hair shaft in the superior segment, associated with dilated follicular ostia. Perifollicular fibrosis is associated with a variety of inflammatory cell types, mostly lymphocytic. One sample shows interfollicular irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, compact orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intraepidermal neutrophils. Follicular architecture is abnormal with abrupt and linear loss of nucleated matrical cells (B fringe of Adamson). The line of Ayber measures 0.30?mm on average. Hair shafts measure up to 0.16?mm, with variable abnormal cross sectional shape, usually square. Outer root sheath epithelium is disorganized with slight cellular pleomorphism, and the cuticle of the inner and outer root sheath is irregular in thickness.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACP), a member of the phenothiazine family, has antioxidant properties and interacts with reactive oxygen species produced by stimulated neutrophils (Serteyn et al. 1999). We found that ACP reduced the differentiation of monocytes induced by an overnight incubation with a crude Chlamydia pneumoniae extract (Serteyn et al. 2001). The same model was used to test the effects of phenothiazines on the TNF-α release by activated monocytes. A crude Chlamydia pneumoniae extract was obtained by mechanical disruption and centrifugation (1?minute, 1500?r.p.m.) of 78?hours infected McCoy cells. Monocytes (THP1 cell line; 2???106 cells by assay) were incubated overnight with 30?µL of Chlamydia pneumoniae crude extract (equivalent to an endotoxin charge of 3.5?pg) in the presence or absence of phenothiazines (from 10?6 to 10?4 M) (Mouithys-Mickalad et al. 2001). For estimation of TNF-α release, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged (to eliminate the undifferentiated monocytes) and used for TNF-α measurements (n?=?6) (Quantikine HS human TNF-α, R&D Systems, UK). Acepromazine was compared to other phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine) or to structural analogues of phenothiazines (phenoxazine, thioxanthen-9-one and methylene blue). For each assay, cytotoxicity was evaluated by microscopic examination and blue trypan exclusion method. Mean values of TNF-α were compared by a Student t-test (p?<?0.05). TNF-α release by Chlamydia-treated THP1 was significantly decreased by ACP in a dose-dependent manner, 378?±?30, 209?±?38 and 189?±?35?ng?mL?1 for 10?6, 10?5 and 10?4 M compared to the control values 385?±?9?ng?mL?1. Similar inhibitions of TNF-α release were obtained with trifluoperazine (313?±?25 and 265?±?14?ng?mL?1 at 10?6 and 10?5 M) and chlorpromazine (323?±?29 and 227?±?13?ng?mL?1 at 10?6 and 10?5 M), but at 10?4 M, these two drugs were cytotoxic. The other structurally parent compounds increased significantly the TNF-α production: 630?±?46 and 468?±?60?ng?mL?1 for thioxanthen-9-one and 547?±?17 and 331?±?111?ng?mL?1 for methylene blue at 10?5 and 10?6 (M). At 10?4 M, the two compounds were cytotoxic. Phenoxazine increased the TNF-α production, slightly at 10?6 and 10?5 M (444?±?39 and 424?±?16?ng?mL?1, respectively) and significantly at 10?4 M (959?±?30?ng?mL?1). Further studies are needed to verify if the inhibition of TNF-α release by some phenothiazines could be linked to a reduction of the signal transduction, especially the NF-?B pathway. These results could be interesting for the anaesthesia or treatment of animals suffering from a systemic inflammatory reaction.

AB  - Abstract Concern about the use of nanomaterials has increased significantly in recent years due to potentially hazardous impacts on human health. Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.

AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.

AB  - Summary A 22-year-old Friesian gelding was presented with a history of chronic, nonresolving lameness localised to the right front foot. Radiographs showed a smoothly marginated circular lucent area with a rim of increased opacity adjacent to the solar canal of the distal phalanx. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a reversed V-shaped smoothly demarcated space-occupying mass causing invagination of the solar laminae towards the solar canal arch and deformity of the adjacent surface of the distal phalanx. The mass was removed surgically and submitted for histopathology, which revealed a keratoma and periosteal fibrosis. Six weeks post-surgery the horse returned to the previous work level and 8 months follow-up showed no recurrence of keratoma. This report highlights the usefulness of MRI as a diagnostic modality for solar keratoma.

AB  - Abstract Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is an uncommon entity and challenging to distinguish from breast carcinoma, both clinically and upon imaging. Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) is a histologically distinct GM with clear ?cystic? spaces (CS) surrounded by neutrophils and may contain Gram-positive bacilli (such as Corynebacterium species). Cytologic features of GM, in particular CNGM, on ThinPrep (TP), are limited. We reviewed the cytological features of GM with a special focus on CNGM on TP. Ten cases with a concurrent/recent FNA and histologic diagnosis of GM or CNGM, or positive culture for Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, were identified over an 11-y period (2007-2017). A double-blinded review of the TP slides was performed by two independent cytopathologists. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Six cases were histologically proven CNGM and 1 FNA only case had a positive culture for C. kroppenstedtii. Three had a histological diagnosis of GM. TP from the 7 CNGM cases demonstrated CS, including 1 case with a cellblock (CB) study showing well-formed clear CS, while none of the non-CNGM cases had CS (P?= .01). Bacteria were identified within CS in 5 of 7 cases of CNGM. Multinucleated giant cells, granulomas, histiocytes, and neutrophils were variably observed. All histologically confirmed cases of CNGM showed distinct CS on TP. Cellblock study is a valuable adjunct to evaluate CNGM and for ancillary studies. Although our study was limited by a small sample size, our findings necessitate the need for studies with a larger cohort.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Contamination and infection of synovial cavities are a common occurrence in clinical practice and, if inadequately treated, may have career or life threatening consequences for affected horses. Hypothesis: The objectives in treating contamination and infection of joints, tendon sheaths and bursae are most effectively met by endoscopic surgery. Methods: Over a 6 year period, cases of synovial contamination and infection admitted to a referral clinic were evaluated and treated endoscopically. The horses received local and systemic antimicrobial drugs with minimal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication but no other medical or surgical treatment. All arthroscope and instrument portals and, when ever possible, all traumatic wounds were closed. Diagnostic information, endoscopic observations and results of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 140 affected animals were referred and 121 cases were treated endoscopically. These involved 70 joints, 29 tendon sheaths, 10 bursae and in 12 cases a combination of synovial cavities. The most common aetiologies were open wounds (n = 54) and self-sealing punctures (n = 41). Foreign material was identified endoscopically in 41 but predicted prior to surgery in only 6 cases. Osteochondral lesions were evident at surgery in 51 and recognised before surgery in 25 cases; 32 horses had intrathecal tendon or ligament defects. Follow-up information was obtained for 118 animals; 106 (90%) survived and 96 (81%) returned to their preoperative level of performance. The presence of osteitis/osteomyelitis, other osteochondral lesions and marked deposits of pannus were associated with nonsurvival. For those animals which survived, non-Thoroughbred horses, a combination of synovial structure involvement and regional i.v. antimicrobial administration were associated with reduced post operative performance. Marked pannus, regional i.v. antimicrobial administration and duration of systemic antimicrobial administration were associated with a group combining nonsurviving animals and those with reduced post operative performance. Conclusions: Endoscopic surgery makes a valuable contribution to the management of synovial contamination and infection. Potential relevance: The information obtained from and therapeutic options offered by endoscopy justify its early use in cases of synovial contamination and infection.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.
