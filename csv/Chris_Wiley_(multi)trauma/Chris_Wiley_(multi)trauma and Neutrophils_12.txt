AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in the dog. Methods: A retrospective study to evaluate the use of a GIA stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in 15 dogs. Results: Reasons for intervention included dehiscence of a previous enterotomy (four of 15), intestinal neoplasia (five of 15), vascular compromise (three of 15), intussusception (two of 15) and foreign body (one of 15). The mean time taken to perform the anastomosis was 7·7 minutes (range five to 12 minutes). No operative complications were recorded and all dogs recovered from the surgery. Major (two dogs) and minor (six dogs) short-term complications of pyrexia and anorexia were recorded in six dogs. In five of these, the cause was considered to be related to a pre-existing peritonitis. One dog was euthanased five months postoperatively for a multi-centric recurrence of intestinal lymphoma. Six month follow-up confirmed an unremarkable and complete recovery in all remaining dogs. No major or minor long-term complications were recorded in any individual. Clinical Significance: A modified stapled functional end-to-end intestinal anastomosis holds merit and should be considered a viable alternative to other stapled and sutured anastomosis techniques.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Summary Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequent cause of severe skin infections. The ability to control the infection is largely dependent on the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (PMN). To gain more insight into the dynamics of PMN migration and host?pathogen interactions in vivo, we used intravital two-photon (2-P) microscopy to visualize S.?aureus skin infections in the mouse. Reporter S.?aureus strains expressing fluorescent proteins were developed, which allowed for detection of the bacteria in vivo. By employing LysM-EGFP mice to visualize PMN, we observed the rapid appearance of PMN in the extravascular space of the dermis and their directed movement towards the focus of infection, which led to the delineation of an abscess within 1 day. Moreover, tracking of transferred labelled bone-marrow neutrophils showed that PMN localization to the site of infection is dependent on the presence of G-protein-coupled receptors on the PMN, whereas Interleukin-1 receptor was required on host cells other than PMN. Furthermore, the S.?aureus complement inhibitor Ecb could block PMN accumulation at thesite of infection. Our results establish that 2-P microscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the orchestration of the immune cells, S.?aureus location and gene expression in vivo on a single cell level.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in animals with anterior uveitis. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). Procedures Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. Results Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. Conclusions Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.

AB  - Vocal cord granulomas are rarely observed in brachycephalic breeds but often reported in humans as contact granulomas. Six French bulldogs were included in this retrospective descriptive study. Endoscopic laryngeal examinations were performed on all dogs under general anaesthesia. Vocal cord lesions were exclusively unilateral, exophytic, approximately 3-mm wide ulcerated mucosal nodules, arising from the vocal cord. Histopathological examination mainly revealed chronic inflammatory changes on the laryngeal epithelium which were consistent with laryngeal granulomas described in humans, except for the location: vocal cord in dogs versus vocal process in humans. In humans, granulomas result from chronic physical or chemical insult to laryngeal mucosa (chronic cough or throat clearing, vocal abuse, gastro-esophageal reflux). In brachycephalic breeds, chronic inspiratory efforts and air turbulences and gastro-esophageal reflux are suspected to result in chronic laryngeal inflammation.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.

AB  - Summary.? Infection frequently elicits a coagulation response. Endotoxin triggers the formation of tissue factor initiating coagulation, down regulates anticoagulant mechanisms including the protein C pathway and heparin-like proteoglycans and up regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor. The overall physiological result of this is to promote coagulation through enhancing initiation, suppressing negative regulation and impairing fibrin removal. The response to infection also leads to tissue destruction. Nucleosomes and histones released from the injured cells trigger further inflammation, protection from the pathogen but further tissue injury leading to multi-organ failure. Such a complex response to infection presumably arises due to the role of coagulation in the control and clearance of the infectious agent.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Avoiding abdominal incisions is one of the unique features of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) surgery. There has been no consensus on whether the avoidance of abdominal incisions can reduce the systemic inflammatory response after NOSE surgery. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transanal NOSE, especially the inflammatory response after transanal NOSE versus mini-laparotomy (LAP). Methods A total of 172 colorectal cancer patients who underwent transanal NOSE were matched with 172 patients who underwent LAP for colorectal cancer. Clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative parameters, and indicators of the inflammatory response were collected and compared. The inflammatory response was assessed by measuring body temperature, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels, and procalcitonin levels. Results Patients in the NOSE group had better short-term outcomes, such as lower incidence of wound infection, less postoperative pain, less need for anesthetic drugs, and faster recovery of intestinal function. Regarding the inflammatory response, the average body temperature of patients in the NOSE group was higher on postoperative day (POD) 2 than that in the LAP group. A higher median neutrophil count and C-reactive protein levels were observed in the NOSE group on POD3 and POD5 than was observed in the LAP group. Conclusions Transanal NOSE is safe and feasible for colorectal cancer, with better short-term outcomes. Although transanal NOSE produced a larger systemic inflammatory response than LAP in the early postoperative stages, this response did not appear to translate into infectious morbidity.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.
