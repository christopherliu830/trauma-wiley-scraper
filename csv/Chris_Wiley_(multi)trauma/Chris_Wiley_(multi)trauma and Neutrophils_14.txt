AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions.

AB  - The inflammatory phase of wound healing performs vital acts of host defense, removing invading microorganisms and or devitalized tissue. Characterized by an infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes, within hours of injury inflammation begins to effectively clear the wound in a strictly regulated manner in preparation for the following stages of repair and regeneration. Chronic wounds are varied in their etiology, resulting from many underlying pathologies. However, collectively they are often described as being in a persistent state of inflammation. Production of proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this unregulated manner can cause significant damage. By stopping the action of proinflammatory cytokines, further recruitment of neutrophils may be diminished, helping to stop protease production at its source. Chronic wound dressings that are able to help interrupt the self- perpetuating process may help to create the optimal wound healing environment. In this study we investigated the impact of silver and then an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccarhide (LPS) stimulated monocyte macrophages (THP-1 cells), an in vitro model of inflammation. The ability of the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC matrix to quench free radicals was also investigated. Results show that the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is capable of reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This dressing also has antioxidant activity, quenching ROS. These influences on the biochemistry of a chronic wound may have an antiinflammatory action, limiting the destruction of new tissue and promoting wound closure.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Abstract Dapsone is a sulfone-type drug used widely for different infectious, immune, and hypersensitivity disorders as an antibacterial treatment alone or in combination for leprosy and sometimes for infected skin lesions. DHS is a severe idiosyncratic adverse reaction with multi-organ involvement. However, acute necrotic hepatitis requiring an emergent LT is rare. Herein, we report a case of 12-yr-old girl who suffered from fulminant hepatitis and multi-organ failure due to DHS for PPD. She was saved by emergent LDLT. A high index of suspicion and rapid diagnosis are necessary not to miss this potentially lethal but rare disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study New therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in human and equine allergic airway diseases are under extensive investigation. Stimulation of Treg cells with immune modulating agents is a novel therapeutic option. Objectives The aim of this field study was to compare the effects of a nebulised nanoparticulate CpG immunotherapy (CpG-GNP) with and without specific allergens. Study design Longitudinal clinical study comparing 2 therapeutic options. Methods Twenty RAO-affected horses were divided into 2 treatment groups (CpG alone and CpG with allergens). Two specific allergens were selected for each horse according to anamnesis and a functional in vitro test. Treatments were given by nebulisation 7 times and the horses were examined 3 times: baseline (I), after the treatment course (II), and after 6 weeks later (III). Clinical parameters, indirect intrapleural measurement, arterial blood gas, amount of tracheal mucus and neutrophil percentage were evaluated. Results CpG alone resulted in a significant improvement in clinical parameters and a significant reduction of tracheal mucus after treatment and at 6 weeks post treatment. After CpG plus specific allergens, there was significant improvement of 70% of examined parameters. However, there were no significant differences in the results compared with CpG-GNP treatment alone. Conclusions There were no significant differences between treatment groups. CpG-GNP immunotherapy alone produced a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory parameters and may have potential as for treatment of equine and human allergic inflammatory airway diseases.

AB  - This study examined the performance of two subjective pain scoring systems for evaluating equine postoperative pain, and investigated differences in pain scoring tendencies of veterinarians and grooms. Fifteen horses were included in the study. Group 1 (n?=?8) had chronic lameness and was admitted for elective arthroscopy under general anaesthesia, on one or two femoropatellar, femorotibial or tibiotarsal joint or digital flexor tendons. The anaesthetic protocol for each horse was similar but not standardized. Multi-modal peri-operative analgesia comprised: romifidine (100?µg?kg?1 IV); flunixin (1.1?mg?kg?1 IV); ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV); morphine (0.12?mg?kg?1 IV); phenylbutazone (4?mg?kg?1 IV/PO). Group 2 (n?=?7) included pain free controls. At 6?hours post-recovery from anaesthesia (PR) (group 1) or at 20.00?hours (group 2 with one limb bandaged), horses were filmed undisturbed in their stables for 90?seconds (dynamic behaviour, DB); thereafter, the surgery site and pharynx of each horse were palpated (and filmed) in a standardized manner (interactive behaviour, IB). Two observer groups, seven veterinarians and eight grooms, watched video footage of each horse and assigned pain scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) and a numerical rating scale (NRS). Observers assigned a pain score (VAS and NRS) for DB and IB separately and overall. Statistical analysis (Minitab 13.0, Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann?Whitney U-tests) investigated differences in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 horses, compared pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms, and examined differences in the performance of VAS and NRS techniques. There were significant differences in the pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms to groups 1 and 2 horses. When using DB or IB separately (but not combined) to score perceived pain, grooms assigned higher scores to group 1 than group 2 (U?=?81.5, p?<?0.05; U?=?82.0, p?<?0.05) using the VAS. There was no difference in NRS scores attributed by grooms to groups 1 and 2. Using DB and IB separately or combined, there was no difference in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 by veterinarians using either VAS or NRS scoring systems. Using separate VAS scores for DB (W?=?32.5, p?<?0.05) and IB (W?=?26.5, p?<?0.05) and using combined (DB?+?IB) VAS scores, grooms awarded higher pain scores (W?=?27.0, p?<?0.05) than veterinarians to group 1. Using the NRS, vets and grooms did not score pain differently for group 1. For group 2, grooms scored pain significantly higher than vets when using the VAS to score IB separately (W?=?21.0, p?<?0.05); no other differences between grooms and veterinarians in pain scoring of group 2 (NRS or VAS, DB and IB separately or combined) were identified. The performance of subjective pain scoring systems for assessment of equine postoperative pain varies according to the scale used, the behaviour evaluated (dynamic or interactive) and the observer group. While data suggest that grooms distinguished post-surgery horses from controls more successfully than vets and assigned higher pain scores to these horses, the specific behavioral criteria on which scores were assigned requires future investigation and identification.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Abstract Our studies have shown that treatment with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the CD11d subunit of the leukocyte integrin CD11d/CD18 after spinal cord injury (SCI) decreases intraspinal inflammation, myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration, improving neurological function in rats. Using severe clip compression SCI in the rat, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were employed to assess the effects of an anti-CD11d mAb treatment on spinal cord cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, formation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a marker of RNA and DNA oxidation) and protein carbonylation (a marker of protein oxidation). We also assessed treatment effects on the expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (redox effector factor-1, APE/Ref-1), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the base excision repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA. The expression of COX-2 and formation of 8-OHdG and protein carbonyl groups were increased after SCI while APE/Ref-1 expression was decreased. Anti-CD11d mAb treatment clearly attenuated COX-2 expression and 8-OHdG and protein carbonyl formation and rescued APE/Ref-1 expression after SCI. This study suggests that anti-CD11d mAb treatment significantly reduces intraspinal free radical formation after SCI, thereby reducing protein and DNA oxidative damage. These effects likely underlie tissue preservation and improved neurological function resulting from the mAb treatment.

AB  - Inhibition of cAMP-dependent stimulation of vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium following haemorrhagic shock is mediated by reactive nitrogen species released within the airspaces of the lung. We tested here the hypothesis that the prior activation of the cellular heat shock or stress response, via exposure to either heat or geldanamycin, would attenuate the release of airspace nitric oxide (NO) responsible for the shock-mediated failure of the alveolar epithelium to respond to catecholamines in rats. Rats were haemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30?35 mmHg for 60 min, and then resuscitated with a 4 % albumin solution. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by change in concentration of a protein solution instilled into the airspaces 5 h after the onset of haemorrhage. Stress preconditioning restored the cAMP-mediated upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance after haemorrhage. The protective effect of stress preconditioning was mediated in part by a decrease in the expression of iNOS in the lung. Specifically, stress preconditioning decreased the production of nitrite by endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages removed from haemorrhaged rats or by A549 and rat alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers stimulated with cytomix (a mixture of TNF-α, IL-1? and IFN-?) for 24 h. In summary, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that stress preconditioning restores a normal fluid transport capacity of the alveolar epithelium in the early phase following haemorrhagic shock by attenuating NO-mediated oxidative stress to the lung epithelium.

AB  - Abstract Tissue approximation and repair are conventionally performed with sutures and staples, but these means are inherently traumatic. Tissue approximation using laser-responsive nanomaterials can lead to rapid tissue sealing and repair, and is an attractive alternative to existing clinical methods. Here, the use of laser-activated nanosealants (LANS) with gold nanorods (GNRs) embedded in silk fibroin polypeptide matrices is demonstrated. The adaptability of LANS for sealing soft tissues is demonstrated using two different modalities: insoluble thin films for internal, intestinal tissue repair, and semisoluble pastes for external repair, shown by skin repair in live mice. Laser repaired intestinal tissue held over seven times more fluid pressure than sutured intestine and also prevented bacterial leakage. Skin incisions in mice closed using LANS' showed indication of increased mechanical strength and faster repair compared to suturing. Laser-activated silk-GNR nanosealants rapidly seal soft-tissue tears and show high promise for tissue approximation and repair in trauma and routine surgery.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Abstract Glucan phosphate is a water-soluble, yeast-derived, (1 ? 3)-?-D-glucopyranose polymer that has been demonstrated to be a potent immune stimulant. Glucan phosphate administration is associated with stimulation of immunity and a concomitant increase in resistance to a variety of experimentally induced disease states. Preclinical safety evaluation indicates that glucan phosphate does not induce mortality or significant toxicity over a wide dose range. Phase I clinical data indicate that glucan phosphate will ameliorate immunosuppression, stimulate immunity, decrease susceptibility to infection and alter ultimate outcome in trauma patients following laparotomy or thoracotomy. This work reviews the development, characterization, preclinal and clinical evaluation of glucan phosphate.

AB  - Abstract Concentration gradients play an important role in controlling biological and pathological processes, such as metastasis, embryogenesis, axon guidance, and wound healing. Microfluidic devices fabricated by photo- and soft lithography techniques can manipulate the fluidic flow and diffusion profile to create biomolecular gradients in a temporal and spatial manner. Furthermore, microfluidic devices enable the control of cell-extracellular microenvironment interactions, including cell?cell, cell?matrix, and cell?soluble factor interaction. In this paper, we review the development of microfluidic-based gradient devices and highlight their biological applications.

AB  - Microsporum canis is a pathogenic fungus that typically causes dermatophytosis in cats. This report describes a cat with a Microsporum canis infection causing invasive fungal rhinitis that extended through the hard palate, resulting in adjacent stomatitis. Treatment with itraconazole and terbinafine resolved the infection.
