AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Abstract: Early postoperative infections and septic complications are predominant causes of morbidity and mortality in patients following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration after OLTx was found to decrease the number of sepsis episodes and sepsis-related mortality. Since polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are one of the major determinants of antimicrobial defense, alteration of their functions may influence the development of sepsis in these patients. Therefore, we investigated in vitro whether or not priming with G-CSF affects the neutrophils? respiratory burst (RB) in immunosuppressed liver-transplanted patients. Venous blood was drawn from liver allograft recipients (n=12) between the 5th and 15th day postoperatively. Patients without clinical signs of infection or rejection were included in this study. Leukocytes were obtained as supernatant following sedimentation and incubated with 1000 IE ml?1 G-CSF. The RB was measured by the intracellular oxidation of non-fluorescent dihydrorhodamine to the fluorescent rhodamine by flow cytometry. The results were expressed as a percentage of increasing stimulation compared to the control responses, which are made up of the percentage of cells with RB reaction after stimulation with phorbol ester (PMA), bacteria (E. coli), or the combination of a cytokine (TNF-α) and a bacterial peptide (FMLP) in the absence of G-CSF. In vitro priming with G-CSF resulted in significantly increased activity of the RB after PMA (from 71.7% to 85.6%) and TNF-α/FMLP (from 58.4% to 72.7%) stimulation. These data demonstrate that G-CSF in vitro augments the RB of PMNs, thereby suggesting a possible therapeutic role for G-CSF as immunomodulating agent during bacterial and fungal infections following OLTx.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

The patient developed fever and crusted, nodulo-ulcerative lesions of the skin after accidental superficial trauma to the forehead. The biopsy revealed suppurative granulomatous inflammation with intracellular and extracellular yeast-like cells with associated clear halo measuring 3?4 ?m in size. Systemic involvement was not found. The lesions cleared after treatment with itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. The medication was continued for a total period of 3 months, with no signs of recurrence after one-year of follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

Nonselective computed tomography angiography with contrast medium injected peripherally via the jugular veins was used to evaluate the vascular supply to the distal limb. The use of this imaging technique demonstrated either intact or disrupted distal limb vasculature. The imaging results were verified with a positive long-term outcome in the case with a diagnosis of an intact vasculature and with histological findings of avascular necrosis in the case with a diagnosis of disrupted vasculature.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Identifying differential responses between sexes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can elucidate the mechanisms behind disease pathology. Peripheral and central inflammation in the pathophysiology of TBI can increase sleep in male rodents, but this remains untested in females. We hypothesized that diffuse TBI would increase inflammation and sleep in males more so than in females. Diffuse TBI was induced in C57BL/6J mice and serial blood samples were collected (baseline, 1, 5, 7 days post-injury [DPI]) to quantify peripheral immune cell populations and sleep regulatory cytokines. Brains and spleens were harvested at 7DPI to quantify central and peripheral immune cells, respectively. Mixed-effects regression models were used for data analysis. Female TBI mice had 77%?124% higher IL-6 levels than male TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, whereas IL-1? and TNF-α levels were similar between sexes at all timepoints. Despite baseline sex differences in blood-measured Ly6Chigh monocytes (females had 40% more than males), TBI reduced monocytes by 67% in TBI mice at 1DPI. Male TBI mice had 31%?33% more blood-measured and 31% more spleen-measured Ly6G+ neutrophils than female TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, and 7DPI, respectively. Compared with sham, TBI increased sleep in both sexes during the first light and dark cycles. Male TBI mice slept 11%?17% more than female TBI mice, depending on the cycle. Thus, sex and TBI interactions may alter the peripheral inflammation profile and sleep patterns, which might explain discrepancies in disease progression based on sex.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.
