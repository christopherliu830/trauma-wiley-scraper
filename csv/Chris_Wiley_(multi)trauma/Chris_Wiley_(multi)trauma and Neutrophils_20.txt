AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma in 1948, it has been investigated as a non-invasive screening tool for many diseases, especially solid tumours and foetal genetic abnormalities. However, to date our lack of knowledge regarding the origin and purpose of cfDNA in a physiological environment has limited its use to more obvious diagnostics, neglecting, for example, its potential utility in the identification of predisposition to disease, earlier detection of cancers, and lifestyle-induced epigenetic changes. Moreover, the concept or mechanism of cfDNA could also have potential therapeutic uses such as in immuno- or gene therapy. This review presents an extensive compilation of the putative origins of cfDNA and then contrasts the contributions of cellular breakdown processes with active mechanisms for the release of cfDNA into the extracellular environment. The involvement of cfDNA derived from both cellular breakdown and active release in lateral information transfer is also discussed. We hope to encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic view of cfDNA research, taking into account all the biological pathways in which cfDNA is involved, and to give serious consideration to the integration of in vitro and in vivo research. We also wish to encourage researchers not to limit their focus to the apoptotic or necrotic fraction of cfDNA, but to investigate the intercellular messaging capabilities of the actively released fraction of cfDNA and to study the role of cfDNA in pathogenesis.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Abstract Various biodegradable hydrogels have been employed as injectable scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery. We report a double-crosslinking strategy of biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels derived from aminated and oxidized hyaluronic acid (HA) with genipin (GP), a compound naturally derived from the gardenia fruit. Fast gelation is attributed to the Schiff-base reaction between amino and aldehyde groups of polysaccharide derivatives, and the subsequent crosslinking with GP results in ideal biodegradability and mechanical properties. The gelation time, morphology, equilibrium swelling, compressive modulus and degradation of double-crosslinked hydrogels were examined. The double crosslinked hydrogels were examined in vivo via subcutaneous injection into a mouse model. Histological results indicated favourable biocompatility, as revealed by an absence of neutrophils and macrophages. These studies demonstrate that double-crosslinked HA hydrogels are potentially useful as injectable, biodegradable hydrogels in tissue-engineering applications.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Objective To-determine the feasibility of a single paracostal abdominal approach for thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and cisterna chyli ablation (CCA) in dogs with chylothorax. Study Design Observational study and prospective case series. Animals Normal dogs (n = 5) and dogs with chylothorax (n = 8). Methods A single paracostal approach with transdiaphragmatic extension for TDL and CCA was developed experimentally (n = 5) and used in 8 clinical cases with subtotal pericardectomy (SPE) performed in 4 dogs. Surgery time, complications, hospitalization time, outcome, and follow-up of clinical cases were recorded. Results Exposure of relevant anatomy was excellent; vital lymphatic staining facilitated identification of lymphatic structures. In clinical cases, mean surgery time for TDL + CCA was 136 minutes. Mean hospitalization time was 3.1 days. Seven of 8 cases survived, with 1 dog dying of heart failure shortly after discharge. One dog required a second (left) paracostal approach to ligate 2 more lymphatic vessels. On follow-up (median, 7 months; range, 2?20 months), there was complete resolution of chylothorax in 6 dogs. Conclusions A single paracostal approach provides excellent exposure of cisterna chyli, caudal thoracic duct, and intestinal lymphatics. This approach eliminates the need for repositioning during combined TDL + CCA procedures and avoids an intercostal thoracotomy.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is an infection of the pleural space. It occurs in dogs and cats and is characterized by a septic suppurative pleural effusion. Animals with the pyothorax can have severe systemic signs, and despite a variety of potential causes the principles of therapy are relatively similar between species and etiologies. The pyothorax is most often associated with a bacterial infection. Clinical history and physical examination abnormalities in animals with the pyothorax relate to respiratory and systemic illness. Clinical signs can be present in animals for weeks to months prior to presentation. The principles of treatment of animals with the pyothorax include removal of the septic effusion and long-term treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Indications for surgical treatment of the pyothorax include evidence of a surgically resectable lesion thought to be responsible for the pyothorax, such as an abscess, mass, or foreign body, or inadequate response to medical management.
