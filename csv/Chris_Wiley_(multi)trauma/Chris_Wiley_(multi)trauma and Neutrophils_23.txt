AB  - Five centimeter segments of the linea alba in mature, female, mixed breed dogs were incised and then approximated with either stainless steel fascial staples or size 0 polypropylene suture material. Breaking strength of the linea alba closures was determined at 0 (Phase I, 18 dogs) and at 7,14, and 31 days (Phase II, 18 dogs). Histology and videointeractive planar morphometry were used to evaluate healing of the linea alba. Breaking strength and histologic and morphometric variables were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance in a split plot design. In a clinical trial, 20 cm linea alba incisions were approximated with stainless steel fascial staples after elective ovariohysterectomy in mature, female, mixed breed dogs (Phase III, eight dogs). The dogs were evaluated at 1, 2, 7,14, 31, 90, and 180 days. Linea alba incisions approximated with polypropylene suture material were significantly stronger than linea alba incisions approximated with stainless steel fascial staples on day 0. There was no significant difference between breaking strength values, histologic, and morphometric appearance of linea alba incisions closed with stainless steel fascial staples or polypropylene suture material when compared 7,14, and 31 days after surgery. All of the dogs in the clinical trial appeared to be normal at all evaluation times. Approximation of linea alba incisions with stainless steel fascial staples compares favorably to closure with a simple continuous pattern of polypropylene suture material with regard to breaking strength, clinical, histologic, and morphometric appearance.

AB  - ABSTRACT The lifespan of the US population is increasing, with the elderly desiring successful aging. This goal is jeopardized as multiple systemic conditions and their treatments become more prevalent with age, causing impaired systemic and oral health and influencing an older person's quality of life. To obtain successful aging, a compression of morbidity must be obtained through prevention and management of disease. This paper describes the most common systemic diseases causing morbidity and mortality in persons aged 65+ years: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, influenza, diabetes mellitus, trauma, Alzheimer's disease, renal diseases, septicemia, and liver diseases. Disease prevalence and the impact of medications and other therapeutic measures used to treat these conditions are discussed. Oral sequelae are reviewed with guidelines for early detection of these deleterious consequences, considerations for oral treatment, and patient management. An understanding of the impact of systemic diseases and treatment on oral health is imperative for dental practitioners to appropriately treat and manage older patients with these conditions. With a focus on early detection and prevention, oral health care providers can improve the quality of life of this population and aid in the attainment of successful aging.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrastructure, and autopsy findings are reported for four Greyhounds with a myeloproliferative disorder. In all dogs abnormalities were found in the granulocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, resulting in granulocytic leukaemia, impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryocytic dysplasia. The presence in blood of many small platelet producing cells (micromegakaryocytes) led to initial diagnostic confusion in three dogs with two of them suspected of having lymphatic leukaemia. An approach to the diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, including the awareness of other clinical possibilities, is presented. The significance of the presence of micromegakaryocytes in the peripheral blood stream is discussed with reference to other veterinary reports and similar findings in man.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Inhaled ozone can induce oxidative injury and airway inflammation. Horses affected by recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) have a decreased pulmonary antioxidant capacity, which may render them more susceptible to oxidative challenge. It is currently unknown whether RAO-affected horses are more susceptible to oxidative stress than those unaffected by RAO. Objectives: To determine whether ozone exposure induces greater oxidative stress and airway inflammation in RAO-affected horses in remission than in healthy horses. Methods: Seven healthy control horses and 7 RAO-affected horses were exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone for 2 h at rest. Results: At baseline, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) ascorbic acid concentrations were lower in RAO-affected horses than healthy controls. Ozone appeared to preferentially oxidise glutathione rather than ascorbic acid 6 h after exposure. Individual healthy and RAO-affected horses demonstrated oxidation of BALF glutathione after ozone exposure. Overall, RAO-affected horses did not demonstrate increased oxidative stress following ozone exposure, compared with healthy horses. Ozone did not induce significant airway inflammation in either group. Conclusions: RAO-affected horses in remission are not more sensitive to ozone despite a decreased pulmonary antioxidant capacity. Sensitivity to ozone appears to be independent of initial pulmonary antioxidant status. Potential relevance: Horses with high susceptibility to oxidative stress may benefit from antioxidant supplementation.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary Myriads of wound-care products are on the market, and making the right choice for a specific wound can be complex, especially because the scientific literature on wound-care products in horses is sparse. To select the best possible dressing, the veterinarian must decide which material is needed to enhance healing. The clinician must then determine if antimicrobial therapy is required. Several antibacterial compounds are available for topical use and are often more effective than systemically administered antibiotics in the management of severe contamination, critical colonization, or infection. To serve the requirements of specific wounds, several combinations of antimicrobial drugs and dressings are available. The wound milieu changes as healing progresses and so do the requirements for dressings. Continued assessment, based on a thorough clinical examination and sound knowledge of the healing process, is indicated, therefore, to maintain an optimal environment for healing.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary The priority in treating the equine patient with acute diarrhoea is to stabilise the haemodynamic aberrations secondary to the fluid and electrolyte losses. Once this has been initiated and the patient is stabilised ancillary treatments may be beneficial. Besides the well established effects of NSAIDs and polymixin B on systemic inflammation, recent studies suggest that the use of DTOS to bind bacterial toxins and Saccharomyces boulardii to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea may be beneficial. The justification for using probiotic products is scant. There is no evidence to suggest that systemic use of antimicrobials benefits equine patients with colitis, with the exception of metronidazole in cases of clostridial diarrhoea. In light of their potentially detrimental effects, their use can, in the opinion of the authors, not be advocated. Better understanding of the pathways of systemic inflammation and more selective anti-inflammatory drugs may be of great benefit in the future.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown complement activation as a possible mechanism for trichloroethylene (TCE) sensitization, leading to multi-organ damage including the kidneys. In particular, excessive deposition of C5 and C5b-9-the membrane attack complex, which can generate significant tissue damage, was observed in the kidney tissue after TCE sensitization. The present study tested the hypothesis that anaphylatoxin C5a binding to its receptor C5aR mediates renal injury in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized through skin challenge with TCE, with or without pretreatment by the C5aR antagonist W54011. Kidney histopathology and the renal functional test were performed to assess renal injury, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescent labeling were carried out to assess C5a and C5aR expressions. TCE sensitization up-regulated C5a and C5aR expressions in kidney tissue, generated inflammatory infiltration, renal tubule damage, glomerular hypercellularity and impaired renal function. Antagonist pretreatment blocked C5a binding to C5aR and attenuated TCE-induced tissue damage and renal dysfunction. TCE sensitization also caused the deposition of major pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? in the kidney tissue (P?<?0.05); this was accompanied by increased expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05). Pretreatment with the C5aR antagonist attenuated the increase of expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05) and also consistently reduced the TCE sensitization-induced increase of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? (P?<?0.05). These data identify C5a binding to C5aR, MAP kinase activation, and inflammatory cytokine release as a novel mechanism for complement-mediated renal injury by sensitization with TCE or other environmental chemicals.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the interpretation of radiographs and blood tests from a rheumatological perspective. Multi-system disease implies concurrent signs and symptoms in multiple organ systems. Its identification is often followed by tests to exclude infections and malignancy since their treatment and prognosis varies. The diagnostic pathway then goes down the route of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). SARDs include conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitides and so on. This diagnosis often involves treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs which, if an infection has not been excluded can cause serious harm. Focusing on the bones, one will have to look for evidence of demineralisation, erosions, joint space narrowing and new bone formation, for example osteophytes.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the dermatological consequences of bed bug bites along with the immunological basis for the reaction in humans. With the recent rise in bed bug infestations, there has also been an increase in the number of patients presenting with allergic responses, and systemic reactions that have beentreated with an immunosuppressant. The signs and symptoms developing from the bite are due to the host's response to the trauma, the subsequent inflammatory response, and immune system reaction to antigens present in the saliva. When a patient is bitten by large numbers of bed bugs, multiple separate lesions can coalesce to mimic generalized maculopapular exanthema. The lesions may be further modified by excoriations and lichenification from persistent scratching, complicating the differential diagnoses. The first step is bed bug eradication from the patient's living environment and prevention of reinfestation. Eradication can be challenging and in most cases requires a licensed and trained pest management professional (PMP).
