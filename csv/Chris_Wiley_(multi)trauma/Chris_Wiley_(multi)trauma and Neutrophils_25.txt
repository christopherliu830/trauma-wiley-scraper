AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been found to prolong survival in selected patients with peritoneal disease, but the extent of cytoreduction and chemoperfusion can result in systemic toxicities. We evaluate the incidence of perioperative hematological complications and its associated risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of CRS-HIPEC cases between April 2001 and October 2016 was performed. Patients were stratified based on the clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative incidence, grade, and duration of leukopenia (white blood cells < 4000/mm3), neutropenia (absolute neutrophils < 2000/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (platelets < 140 000/mm3). Results Two hundred and thirty-five CRS-HIPEC were performed in 220 patients with peritoneal metastasis of colorectal, ovarian, primary peritoneal, appendiceal, or mesothelioma origins. The incidences of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were 15.3%, 3.8%, and 37.9%, respectively. Median time to onset was 1 day (0-16 days), 0 day (0-2 days), and 1 day (1-2 days), respectively, after operation. Median duration of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was 1 day (1-3 days), 1 day (1-2days), and 3 days (range 0-16 days), respectively. Age > 60 (odds ratio [OR] 0.229 [95% CI: 0.105-0.502], P < .001) and the use of prior chemotherapy (OR 2.46 [95% CI: 1.24, 4.83], P = .010) were independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia on multivariable logistic regression. Conclusion Hematological toxicities are common after hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with thrombocytopenia being most common. Patients with age > 60, and who have undergone chemotherapy, are at risk of these toxicities and should be closely monitored post CRS-HIPEC.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - This case series describes four cases of concomitant dermoid sinus and spina bifida in a Chinese crested dog, two Swedish vallhunds and a Burmese cat. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography, computed tomography fistulography and pathology. Two dogs that showed abnormalities during neurological examination underwent magnetic resonance imaging. One of them had imaging findings interpreted as syringohydromyelia. All the dogs underwent surgery and the outcome was considered good in all the cases. Based on clinical and pathological examination as well as diagnostic imaging findings, two of the dermoid sinuses were classified as type IV, and two of them showed a previously unreported type of dermoid sinus. This new type is suggested here as type VI.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Summary Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial inhibition plays a major role in the development of multiple organ failure during sepsis. Early correction of tissue hypoxia, strict control of glycaemia and modulation of oxidative and nitrosative stress may protect mitochondria during the acute inflammatory response. Once mitochondrial dysfunction has developed, the regulated induction of a hypometabolic state, analogous to hibernation, may protect the cells from severe bioenergetic failure and a critical fall in ATP. Though this is clinically manifest as organ dysfunction, it may actually represent an adaptive response to a prolonged, severe inflammatory stress. Repair of damaged organelles, stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and re-activation of cellular metabolism may accelerate the recovery phase and thus improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss putative interventions aimed at preventing or reversing mitochondrial dysfunction that may have possible clinical relevance, and to stress the importance of the correct timing of intervention.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Abstract A new periodontitis classification scheme has been adopted, in which forms of the disease previously recognized as ?chronic? or ?aggressive? are now grouped under a single category (?periodontitis?) and are further characterized based on a multi-dimensional staging and grading system. Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentation as well as on the complexity of disease management, while grading provides supplemental information about biological features of the disease including a history-based analysis of the rate of periodontitis progression; assessment of the risk for further progression; analysis of possible poor outcomes of treatment; and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect the general health of the patient. Necrotizing periodontal diseases, whose characteristic clinical phenotype includes typical features (papilla necrosis, bleeding, and pain) and are associated with host immune response impairments, remain a distinct periodontitis category. Endodontic-periodontal lesions, defined by a pathological communication between the pulpal and periodontal tissues at a given tooth, occur in either an acute or a chronic form, and are classified according to signs and symptoms that have direct impact on their prognosis and treatment. Periodontal abscesses are defined as acute lesions characterized by localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket/sulcus, rapid tissue destruction and are associated with risk for systemic dissemination.

AB  - A three-year-old, 30-kg, spayed female German wirehaired pointer was presented for coughing, pyrexia and lethargy. Thoracic radiographs showed mild right-sided pleural effusion, moderate pneumothorax and a pulmonary lesion in the right middle or caudal lung lobe. A diagnosis of pyothorax was established by fine needle aspiration of the pleural effusion. Thoracoscopic exploration was performed using one-lung ventilation. A vegetal foreign body (grass awn) and an abscess were observed in the distal part of the right middle lung lobe. The foreign body was removed and a right middle lung lobectomy was performed, both thoracoscopically. No complications were noted. The dog was discharged 48 hours after surgery, and no recurrence of the clinical signs was observed during the follow-up time period (three years and three months). Thoracoscopy is a minimally invasive alternative to thoracotomy to explore and successfully treat some non-chronic pyothoraces in dogs, including lesions affecting the right middle lung lobe.

AB  - Summary Largely based on the fact that administration of purified lipopolysaccharide induces many of the signs of circulatory insufficiency that occur in horses with a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, these signs have been linked with the term endotoxemia. However, differences between experimentally induced endotoxemia and the clinical syndrome of endotoxemia have been recognized by veterinary clinicians. A similar situation exists in human medicine where the term ?systemic inflammatory response syndrome? (SIRS) was coined for the clinical responses of human patients to nonspecific insults (i.e., in the absence of a documented infection). Our current knowledge regarding the systemic inflammatory response to bacterial ligands provides the basis for reconsidering the widespread usage of the term endotoxemia in equine clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

In this study, effect of the CDS for the treatment of fresh DDB wounds was tested. Methods: Six cases of second-degree burns, diagnosed as DDB by observation of blood stream of the dermal capillary using Compact Micro Vision System (Hi-Scope?, Hi Rox Co., Japan), were treated with the cultured allogenic fibroblasts, CDS. Results: The epithelialization of the wounds was obtained on 8.2?±?2.6 (mean?±?SD) days after the application. Conclusion: The results of our clinical experiences suggest that the allogenic cultured fibroblasts have beneficial effect on the wound healing of the DDB.

Because of the high prevalence of cruciate ligament rupture, and the popularity of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO), more studies have focused on this procedure than on any other stifle procedure. Extracapsular techniques for cruciate ligament stabilization have generally been associated with a lesser risk of infection. Even though SSI can occur up to a year postoperatively, most infections are diagnosed within the first couple of months after surgery. Radiographic signs of infection are generally mild and non-specific unless the infection is severe and chronic. Infections associated with the implant that develops after bone consolidation is often treated by implant removal, followed by a short course of antibiotics.

AB  - Abstract A new periodontitis classification scheme has been adopted, in which forms of the disease previously recognized as ?chronic? or ?aggressive? are now grouped under a single category (?periodontitis?) and are further characterized based on a multi-dimensional staging and grading system. Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentation as well as on the complexity of disease management, while grading provides supplemental information about biological features of the disease including a history-based analysis of the rate of periodontitis progression; assessment of the risk for further progression; analysis of possible poor outcomes of treatment; and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect the general health of the patient. Necrotizing periodontal diseases, whose characteristic clinical phenotype includes typical features (papilla necrosis, bleeding, and pain) and are associated with host immune response impairments, remain a distinct periodontitis category. Endodontic-periodontal lesions, defined by a pathological communication between the pulpal and periodontal tissues at a given tooth, occur in either an acute or a chronic form, and are classified according to signs and symptoms that have direct impact on their prognosis and treatment. Periodontal abscesses are defined as acute lesions characterized by localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket/sulcus, rapid tissue destruction and are associated with risk for systemic dissemination.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.
