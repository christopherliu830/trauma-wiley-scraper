AB  - Summary A 10-year-old Warmblood gelding presented with a left hindlimb lameness. Diagnostic analgesia located the lameness to the stifle. Radiography showed an unusually large cyst in the distal femur. Diagnostic arthroscopy of the stifle did not reveal any significant abnormalities. An extra-articular transcortical approach to the cyst was performed for drainage, curettage, and provision of an autologous, cancellous bone graft, gentamicin-impregnated collagen fleeces and injectable steroid. The horse returned to a higher level of competitive dressage than prior to surgery. This report describes a large cyst in the distal femur of a horse.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center's clinical study, using allogeneic CDS are proceeded in 30 hospitals as the Millennium Project of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The clinical trial in our hospital was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of refractory skin ulcers. Methods: The application of CDS on the debrided wound was repeated at an interval of 3 to 5 days. The evaluation was performed according to the protocol, especially focused on granulation tissue formation, wound size reduction, and epithelialization. Results: The clinical trials were conducted in 6 cases, including 5 cases with various complications, i.e., diabetes (2 cases), collagen diseases (1 case), renal failure (1 case), and skin defect after resection of tumor (1 case). According to the comprehensive judgement, 5 cases were evaluated as achieving excellent, and 1 case was evaluated as achieving good. Conclusion: The successful application of CDS is dependent on the control of wound conditions free from infection. Appropriate debridment was necessary prior to application of CDS.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

AB  - Abstract A 25-year-old Thai housewife had a history of tuberculosis of the lymph nodes for six years that had been successfully treated with a course of anti-TB drugs. She developed several red, circumscribed, infiltrative plaques composed of umbilicated papules and pustules on her face and upper part of the body with cervical lymphadenopathy six months later. A pus smear from the lesion grew acid fast bacilli (AFB). Histopathological examination showed a mixed cell granuloma suggestive of infection. A T cell study showed a low CD4 count, and multi skin tests indicated cutaneous anergy. Culture from a biopsy specimen taken from the skin lesion grew M.chelonae; the cultures from blood, urine, and bone marrow. The lesions were not responsive to an anti TB drug given for 2 months based upon the results of the AFB positive pus smear before the culture and sensitivity reports were obtained. Since then the patient was treated with antibiotics according to the results of the sensitivity tests. A combination of amikacin and clarithromycin was started and hyperthermic therapy was later added with a partial response. Based upon the sensitivity test, kanamycin was introduced but had to be stopped because of ototoxicity. Sparfloxacin was used with an effective result but was discontinued for economic reasons. Finally, clarithromycin in combination with clofazimine and cryotherapy were given for a year before the lesions healed completely. It took a three years duration for the total course of treatment for this patient. She is still in remission after two years of follow-up period. This extensive cutaneous M.chelonae infection needed a prolonged combination of antibiotics with the addition of cryotherapy for the non-responsive lesions.

AB  - Summary In this article we report 3 horses that developed an extraperitoneal abscess after colic surgery at the incision site. All 3 horses presented with nonspecific clinical signs and extraperitoneal abscess was diagnosed from ultrasound evaluations and cytological examination of abscess aspirates. One horse developed dehiscence of the incision after drainage of the abscess through the incision. In 2 cases a small standing paramedian incision was performed through which the abscess was drained and lavaged; complete resolution of the abscess and healing of the incision was achieved in both cases. Extraperitoneal abscess is a previously unreported incisional complication after colic surgery in horses. Early and careful ultrasonographic examination of the abdominal incision is required for diagnosis in cases with nonspecific clinical signs. A paramedian incision through the rectus abdominis muscle into the abscess cavity permitted adequate drainage and debridement of the abscess in 2 cases.

AB  - Summary Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, whilst highly effective in the treatment of neoplasia, can also cause damage to healthy tissue. In particular, the alimentary tract may be badly affected. Severe inflammation, lesioning and ulceration can occur. Patients may experience intense pain, nausea and gastro-enteritis. They are also highly susceptible to infection. The disorder (mucositis) is a dose-limiting toxicity of therapy and affects around 500?000 patients world-wide annually. Oral and intestinal mucositis is multi-factorial in nature. The disruption or loss of rapidly dividing epithelial progenitor cells is a trigger for the onset of the disorder. However, the actual dysfunction that manifests and its severity and duration are greatly influenced by changes in other cell populations, immune responses and the effects of oral/gut flora. This complexity has hampered the development of effective palliative or preventative measures. Recent studies have concentrated on the use of bioactive/growth factors, hormones or interleukins to modify epithelial metabolism and reduce the susceptibility of the tract to mucositis. Some of these treatments appear to have considerable potential and are at present under clinical evaluation. This overview deals with the cellular changes and host responses that may lead to the development of mucositis of the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, and the potential of existing and novel palliative measures to limit or prevent the disorder. Presently available treatments do not prevent mucositis, but can limit its severity if used in combination. Poor oral health and existing epithelial damage predispose patients to mucositis. The elimination of dental problems or the minimization of existing damage to the alimentary tract, prior to the commencement of therapy, lowers their susceptibility. Measures that reduce the flora of the tract, before therapy, can also be helpful. Increased production of free radicals and the induction of inflammation are early events in the onset of mucositis. Prophylactic administration of scavengers or anti-inflammatories can partially counteract or limit some of these therapy-mediated effects, as can the use of cryotherapy. The regular use of mouthwashes, mouth coatings, antibiotics and analgesics is essential, prior to and during loss and ablation of the epithelial layer. Granulocyte?macrophage colony-stimulating factor/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or the use of laser light therapy may aid restitution and repair. Glutamine supplements may be beneficial in the repair/recovery phase.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Fungal endometritis is a relatively rare cause of infertility in the mare, accounting for only 1?5% of all cases of endometritis. However, it remains a challenge to the clinician due to difficulties in diagnosing and effectively treating affected mares, resulting in a high rate of recurrence and a guarded prognosis for ongoing fertility. Often occurring as an opportunistic infection, the most common causes of fungal endometritis in the mare are yeasts (Candida spp.) and moulds with septated hyphae (Aspergillus spp.). Early detection and identification of the causative agent are vital when choosing appropriate treatment as sensitivities to commonly used antifungals vary significantly. Assessing in vitro sensitivity for each isolate is accordingly recommended. Treatment of mares with fungal endometritis is multifaceted and includes; correction of any anatomical defects, uterine lavage and systemic and/or intrauterine infusion of antifungals. Concurrent bacterial infection is common so anticipation and subsequent treatment of bacterial endometritis is also often required.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - ABSTRACT The spatiotemporal analysis of the proteomic profile during human wound healing is a critical investigative step that can establish the complex interplay of molecular events that comprise the local response to burn injury. Partial-thickness wound samples with adjacent ?normal? skin were collected from twenty-one patients with burn wounds and examined across a time spectrum ranging from the acute injury period at 3, 6, 11 days to the later hypertrophic scar period at 7 and 15 months. The techniques used for histology-directed tissue analyses highlighted inflammatory protein markers at the early time points after injury with diminished expression as burn wounds progressed into the proliferative phase. The datasets show the usefulness of MALDI MS and imaging mass spectrometry as discovery approaches to identify and map the cutaneous molecular sequence that is activated in response to the unique systemic inflammatory response following burn trauma. This information has the potential to define the unique factors that predispose human burn victims to disfiguring hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Background Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comes with a significant risk of life-threatening infection during periods of prolonged severe neutropenia. We studied the impact of preventive intravenous (IV) antibiotic administration at onset of absolute neutropenia on the incidence and outcome of life-threatening infections during treatment of childhood AML. Procedures This is a retrospective study on pediatric patients (aged 0?18 years) consecutively diagnosed with de novo AML and treated at a single institution from April 2005 through February 2013. Patients were treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0531 protocol or with a modified United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML 10 regimen. Pertinent data were extracted from hard copy or electronic chart review. Results A total of 76 chemotherapy phases were analyzed from 29 patients. In each phase reported, preventive antibiotics were initiated when the daily absolute neutrophil count was <500?cells/mcl, before onset of fever. Seven episodes of bacteremia were documented with predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci and viridans group streptococci. One infection-related death occurred, attributed to progressive respiratory failure occurring months after documented candidal pneumonia. Conclusions Initiation of preventive antibiotics at the onset of absolute neutropenia was associated with no mortality from bacteremia. This preventive approach appears feasible and safe.

Herein, we evaluate the efficacy of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for retinoblastoma associated with >50% retinal detachment. Procedure Retrospective review of 37 eyes of 34 retinoblastoma patients who had extensive (>50%) bullous non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and received ophthalmic artery chemosurgery either as primary treatment or as ?salvage? treatment after failed multi-cycle intravenous chemotherapy and/or external beam radiation (mean follow-up, 21 months). Data on patient and ocular survival, complications of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery treatments, time course of retinal reattachment, and serial electroretinograms (ERG) were collected. Results A total of 134 ophthalmic artery chemosurgery injections were performed. All children survive. Five eyes (5/37; 14%) were enucleated for progression of disease. The Kaplan?Meier enucleation-free survival rate at 2 years was 87.9% (95% confidence interval, 76.5?99.3%). The retina reattached in 28 eyes (28/37; 76%) and the 30-Hz flicker ERGs improved by >25?µV in seven eyes (7/37; 19%), remained stable (change?<?25?µV) in 26 eyes (26/37; 70%), and decreased by >25?µV in four eyes (4/37; 11%). The Kaplan?Meier retinal reattachment rate was 58% after 3 months and three ophthalmic artery chemosurgery infusions (95% confidence interval, 41.9?74.1%). Conclusions Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery is effective in preventing enucleation, promoting retinal reattachment and preserving or improving retinal function in the majority of eyes with advanced retinoblastoma and >50% retinal detachment that would otherwise be considered for enucleation.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.
