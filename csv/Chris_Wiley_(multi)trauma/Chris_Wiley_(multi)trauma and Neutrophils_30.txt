AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Abstract Despite recent advance in bioinspired adhesives, achieving strong adhesion and sealing hemostasis in aqueous and blood environments is challenging. A hyperbranched polymer (HBP) with a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic adhesive catechol side branches is designed and synthesized based on Michael addition reaction of multi-vinyl monomers with dopamine. It is demonstrated that upon contacting water, the hydrophobic chains self-aggregate to form coacervates quickly, displacing water molecules on the adherent surface to trigger increased exposure of catechol groups and thus rapidly strong adhesion to diverse materials from low surface energy to high energy in various environments, such as deionized water, sea water, PBS, and a wide range of pH solutions (pH = 3 to 11) without use of any oxidant. Also, this HBP adhesive (HBPA) exhibits a robust adhesion to fractured bone, precluding the problem of mismatched surface energy and mechanical properties. The HBPA's adhesion is repeatable in a wet condition. Intriguingly, the HBPA is capable of gluing dissimilar materials with distinct properties. Importantly, introducing long alkylamine into this modular hyperbranched architecture contributes to formation of an injectable hemostatic sealant that can rapidly stop visceral bleeding, especially hemorrhage from deep wound.

AB  - Summary Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is an important component of the first-line defence against infections. Evidence has shown that MBL deficiency, reducing phagocytosis and internalization of intracellular pathogens may protect the host against intracellular infections such as leprosy. In this study, we speculated whether genetically determined low MBL serum levels confer protection against Mycobacterium leprae infection. One hundred and ninety-one patients with leprosy, presenting lepromatous (n?=?118), tuberculoid (n?=?31), dimorph (n?=?30) and indeterminate (n?=?12) clinical forms and 110 healthy controls matched with the patients according to sex, age and ethnic background were investigated. MBL concentrations were measured in a double-antibody enzyme immune assay and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels by nephelometry. A significant negative association of MBL low values (<?100?ng/ml) was observed with lepromatous patients when comparing with controls and tuberculoid patients [10/118, 8·47%versus 21/110, 19·09%P?=?0·03 ?2 with Yates? correction, odds ratio (OR) 0·39, confidence interval (CI) 0·18?0·88 and 8/31, 25·81%, P?=?0·02, OR 0·27, CI 0·09?0·75, respectively]. There was no significant difference in the distribution of MBL levels between patients and controls or among the clinical forms. The concentration of CRP was significantly increased in the patients (P?=?0·0002) and in the lepromatous form (P?=?0·0001) when compared to controls. A weak positive correlation between MBL and CRP levels was observed in the patients (P?=?0·010, R?=?0·255). These data suggest a protective role for MBL deficiency against the development of the most severe and multi-bacillary form of leprosy.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - Summary A low platelet count is a frequently encountered haematological abnormality in patients treated in intensive treatment units (ITUs). Although severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ? 109/l) can be associated with bleeding, even moderate-degree thrombocytopenia is associated with organ failure and adverse prognosis. The aetiology for thrombocytopenia in ITU is often multifactorial and correcting one aetiology may not normalise the low platelet count. The classical view for thrombocytopenia in this setting is consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, but other concepts, including platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and leucocytes, platelet aggregation by increased von Willebrand factor release, red cell damage and histone release, and platelet destruction by the complement system, have recently been described. The management of severe thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion in the presence of active bleeding or invasive procedure, but the risk-benefit of prophylactic platelet transfusions in this setting is uncertain. In this review, the incidence and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITU, its prognostic significance and the impact on organ function is discussed. A practical approach based on the authors' experience is described to guide management of a critically ill patient who develops thrombocytopenia.

AB  - ABSTRACT A two-year-old spayed female shih-tzu was referred with a 10-month history of lethargy, chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. On presentation, a partial response to antibiotics was noted. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass, and serum biochemistry and haematology revealed a mature neutrophilia, hypoalbuminaemia and a non-regenerative anaemia. Contrast radiography and abdominal ultrasound were suggestive of an intraluminal foreign body. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a surgical swab in the lumen of the jejunum that was associated with severe adhesions. Histopathology showed evidence of transmural migration of the swab from the peritoneal cavity to the lumen of the jejunum.

AB  - Background Anecdotal reports suggest a recent high prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in Irish wolfhounds, prompting further investigation into the incidence of the disease in this breed. Objectives To investigate the possibility that Irish wolfhounds have an increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and to consider possible predisposing causes in this breed. Methods Retrospective review of medical records from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Sydney, from January 2008 to December 2012 inclusive to determine the total hospital incidence and individual breed incidences of aspiration pneumonia. Results The total hospital incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 0?·?5%. The Irish wolfhound had the highest breed incidence, with 9 of 25 dogs (36%) diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Four of the Irish wolfhounds had a predisposing cause identified; one having a choking episode, one having gastric bloat, while two were diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis after it was specifically investigated because of clinical suspicion. Five had no underlying cause of their aspiration pneumonia determined. Clinical Significance On the basis of the hospital population studied, the Irish wolfhound has a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation into the possible predisposing cause(s) in this breed is warranted.

AB  - The authors have developed a CDS by culturing fibroblasts on the two-layered spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid (HA) and atelo-collagen (Col). This CDS is designed to promote wound healing by synergistic effect of fibroblasts and matrix. Both HA and Col molecules seem to function biologically in the process of wound healing. HA molecules play a critical role in several cellular functions such as migration and proliferation by promoting adhesion and disadhesion between the cell and the tissue substrate. Besides providing structural support and strength to the new tissue, Col molecules have a profound effect on the cells within and on its matrix. Col and Col-derived peptides act as chemoattractants for fibroblasts in vitro and may have a similar activity in vivo. Fibroblasts seeded on the Col surface of two-layered spongy matrix were found to attach, proliferate, and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as fibronectin. The cryopreserved CDS was found to keep the original potency to release VEGF after thawing followed by re-culturing. Multi-center's clinical research using allogeneic CDS has been proceeded as a national millennium project for regenerative medicine. These products are able to be stored in a freezer and transported to other hospitals in a frozen state. The clinical evaluation involving 180 cases has been already conducted using allogeneic cryopreserved CDS at 30 hospitals across Japan since April 2001. The results obtained in our clinical study suggest that this type of allogeneic CDS is able to provide an effective therapy for patients with severe full-thickness skin defects. These excellent clinical evaluations seem to be closely related to the results obtained in this fundamental study, especially related to the potency of cryopreserved allogeneic CDS to release VEGF and fibronectin.

AB  - Intra-abdominal cryptococcosis was diagnosed in two young dogs. The first, an entire male border collie, was presented with vomiting. An abdominal mass detected during physical examination proved to be cryptococcal mesenteric lymphadenitis on exploratory laparotomy. The second dog, a female neutered giant schnauzer, was presented with neurological signs suggestive of encephalopathy. Intestinal cryptococcal granulomas were detected in an extensive diagnostic investigation which included abdominal ultrasonography. The gastrointestinal tract was considered the most likely portal of entry for cryptococcal organisms in both cases. Both dogs were treated using surgery and multiagent antifungal chemotherapy. The first case succumbed despite therapy, while the second dog was treated successfully as gauged by return to clinical normality and a substantial decline in the cryptococcal antigen titre which continued to fall after cessation of treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary to work in the emergency and unscheduled care setting for treating infectious diseases, and sepsis. It then highlights key history/assessment knowledge, identifying red-flags, and defining and assisting with making a diagnosis. The chapter also explores these ailments, with core information on definition, aetiology, epidemiology, history, examination, investigations and management. Malaria is one of the most common causes of fever and illnesses in the tropics. History of malaria includes foreign travel to endemic area, fever, and flu-like symptoms. Sepsis causes a number of abnormal physiological processes. ABCDE assessment and interventions are preferred for sepsis treatment. Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. Typhoid fever is a symptomatic bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body. IV antibiotics are considered for this kind of infections.

AB  - Summary An investigation of 78 cases of typical Australian Stringhalt from 52 properties in Victoria was carried out from 1985 to 1987. Horses were either examined in the field (n = 52), referred to the Veterinary Clinical Centre (n = 13) or clinical details were obtained verbally (n = 13). In addition 10 cases of false or atypical stringhalt were examined. Detailed soil and pasture analysis was carried out on 14 properties where Australian Stringhalt had occurred. Information was also obtained on epidemiology of the condition from a survey of practitioners. Fifty of the 52 cases examined in the field occurred in horses that were dependent upon poor quality unimproved dry pasture. In all but a few cases, there was no pasture improvement or fertiliser application, leading to the development of weed-dominated pastures, particularly by flatweed, Hypochaeris radicata. The range of clinical signs exhibited by horses with Australian Stringhalt was described and a grading system proposed to classify horses according to severity of signs. Laryngeal abnormalities were present in 10 of 11 cases examined endoscopically and these horses exhibited increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in the long digital extensor muscle at rest and during hindlimb flexion. To a large extent, the EMG changes disappeared and digital extensor muscle atrophy improved in two horses that were monitored to recovery. Deep peroneal nerve conduction studies in four horses with Australian Stringhalt showed a substantial reduction in nerve conduction velocity and when stimulated at 50 Hz were unable to sustain activation of the long digital extensor muscle. EMG and evoked responses appeared to be sensitive indicators of the state of the disease. Spontaneous recovery over a period ranging from a few days to over 18 months occurred in 78 per cent (45 out of 58) of field cases available for follow up, although eight horses were destroyed on humane grounds or for pathological investigation.

AB  - Summary The present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) in mice. Antinociceptive activity was assessed by employing different pain models, such as formalin test, acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, in mice. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was evaluated in CGP-treated mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using paw oedema induced by carrageenan, compound 48/80, serotonin, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and analyzed by plethysmometry. Quantitation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the paw was carried out to analyze the presence of neutrophils in the tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of CGP produced a significant inhibition in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of formalin-induced pain. The antinociceptive effect of CGP, evaluated in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, was detected for up to 6 h after treatment. Further, in the hot plate test, antinociceptive behaviour was evoked by CGP, and this response was inhibited by naloxone. Animals treated with CGP did not present changes in motor performance. In CGP-treated mice there was an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the periaqueductal gray. In another set of experiments, CGP attenuated the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan. Furthermore, CGP also reduced the carrageenan-increased MPO activity in paws. In addition, CGP also reduced the paw oedema evoked by compound 48/80, serotonin, and PGE2. Taken together, these results may support a possible therapeutic application of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro toward alleviating nociception and damage caused by inflammation conditions.

AB  - Objectives: To characterise dogs with meningomyelitis and to compare signalment, body temperature and vaccination status to a representative control group. Methods: Dogs with meningomyelitis were identified retrospectively. Signalment, history, vaccination status, body temperature, severity of neurological dysfunction (modified Frankel score), diagnostic procedures, aetiology, survival to discharge and long-term survival were analysed. Results: Affected dogs were younger (P<0·05) and more frequently hound or toy breeds (P<0·05) when compared with controls. Hound and toy breed dogs less than or equal to three years of age had a 13 times higher odds of meningomyelitis compared with other breeds (P<0·001). General proprioceptive ataxia, limb paresis and paraspinal hyperaesthesia were the most common clinical signs. Meningomyelitis of unknown aetiology and granulomatous meningomyelitis were the most common diagnoses. The median time to death or continued follow-up in dogs alive at discharge was 213 days. Meningomyelitis resulted in death or euthanasia in 14 of 28 dogs. Clinical signs improved or resolved in seven of 28 dogs. Clinical Significance: Meningomyelitis is a differential diagnosis for dogs with clinical signs of myelopathy. Young dogs and toy or hound breeds seem to be predisposed. Clinical signs of meningomyelitis improve or resolve in some dogs.

One dog was observed ingesting a piece of meat. Analysis of urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from each of the dogs identified the presence of barbiturates. Both dogs recovered with supportive treatment. This is the first report to describe the use of toxicological urinalysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the diagnosis of barbiturate intoxication in dogs.

AB  - Summary An adult Quarter Horse gelding (Case 1) was evaluated for tachypnoea and acute dysphagia. A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding (Case 2) was evaluated for respiratory stertor and severe, acute swelling of the head in the submandibular region. A physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, upper airway endoscopy, and peripheral blood Anaplasma phagocytophilum polymerase chain reaction were completed for both horses. Both horses tested positive for A. phagocytophilum. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 1 revealed a feed contaminated pharynx, absent swallowing reflex, and left laryngeal hemiplagia. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 2 revealed severe diffuse pharyngeal swelling occluding the airway. Due to increased respiratory effort in Case 2, a tracheotomy was performed. In both horses, treatment consisted of intravenous oxytetracycline 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 2?3 days followed by minocycline 4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h for 10?14 days. Both horses made full recoveries.

AB  - A two-year-old Rottweiler presented for acute onset of a right hindlimb lameness 20 weeks after a cementless total hip replacement (THR) and 16 weeks after open reduction to address luxation of the THR. Radiographs revealed periosteal proliferation of the medial acetabulum and a stable implant. Synovial fluid cytology was consistent with inflammatory joint fluid. Treatment consisted of surgical debridement and intravenous and oral antibiotics. THR implants were not removed. Culture of tissue removed from the THR site yielded growth of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus species. Lameness resolved 2 months after surgery. Twenty months after surgery, the dog was exercising normally with no clinical lameness and pelvic radiographs revealed no evidence of implant loosening and markedly decreased periosteal reaction. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an infected THR site successfully treated without prosthesis explantation in the dog.
