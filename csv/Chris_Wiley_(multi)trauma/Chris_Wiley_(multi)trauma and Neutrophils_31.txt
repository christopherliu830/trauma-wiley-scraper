AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - A case of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in a six-month-old male Maremma shepherd dog is reported. The dog was referred with a four month history of progressive weakness and depression with loss of trained habits. Tendency to recumbency, disorientation, visual impairment, bilaterally decreased menace response and hindlimb conscious proprioception deficits were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse hypointense signal involving the cerebral grey matter with enlargement of the cerebral sulci on T1-weighted and fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences consistent with a diffuse necrosis or atrophy of the cortical grey matter. Histological examination revealed severe inflammatory infiltration mainly composed of eosinophils and macrophages in the subarachnoid space and in the superficial layer of the cerebral cortex where parenchymal rarefaction and necrosis of neurones were also evident. No parasites, cysts or fungi were detected, and an immunologically mediated disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging may represent a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis from other inflammatory brain diseases of young dogs.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary artery thrombosis (PAT) is involved in lung vascular dysfunction during acute chest syndrome (ACS) complicating sickle cell disease (SCD). No clinical score is available to identify patients eligible for multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography during ACS. This retrospective study aimed to develop a risk score for PAT during ACS (PAT-ACS risk score). Patients with SCD were investigated by MDCT during ACS. A logistic regression was performed to determine independent risks factors for PAT and to build the PAT-ACS risk score. A total of 43 episodes (11·9%) of PAT were diagnosed in 361 episodes of ACS. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors, which were included in the PAT-ACS risk score: a baseline haemoglobin >82 g/l, the lack of a triggering factor for ACS, a platelet count >440 ? 109/l and a PaCO2 <38 mmHg at ACS diagnosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the PAT-ACS risk score was 0·74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0·69?0·79) and differed from that of the revised Geneva score (0·63 (95% CI 0·58?0·69); P = 0·04). The negative predictive value of a PAT-ACS risk score ≥2 was 94%. In conclusion, we propose a simple clinical risk score to identify SCD patients at high risk of PAT during ACS.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating and often progressive condition leading to exercise intolerance and frequently the demise of the animal. Although uncommonly encountered in horses, the condition is intensely researched both in human medicine and animal models. Viral infections have long been suspected to play a part in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions in other species. In 2007, an association between equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection and nodular pulmonary fibrosis in horses was suggested and the name equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) was introduced. Recently, the presence of EHV-5 in equine lymphoma has also emerged. The case report by Schwarz et?al. in this issue describes a horse suffering from concurrent T cell leukaemia and EMPF in association with EHV-5. This article summarises current knowledge about EMPF and EHV-5 infections in horses, recent developments in the understanding of pulmonary fibrosis in man and the proposed contribution of viral infections to pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions.

AB  - Summary There is limited information on long-term follow-up and prognostic indicators for horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF). The objectives of this study were to describe the signalment, clinicopathological data, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads, clinical outcomes, and pathologic lesions associated with EMPF. Medical records from 2008 to 2016 were reviewed for this retrospective case series of 14 horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis on lung histopathology. Independent variables associated with survival to hospital discharge (short-term survival) were determined using Chi-square or Fisher?s exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated when applicable. Short-term survival was 57%, with only 14% of cases surviving longer than 6 months after discharge. The odds of short-term survival were higher in horses administered corticosteroids (OR = 0.029, 95% CI 0.002-0.615; P = 0.026). Severity of thoracic radiographic changes and equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads measured by quantitative PCR in the lung on presentation were not associated with survival time. Severity of thoracic radiographic changes was also not correlated to equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads in the lung ante-mortem. Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis for survival, with horses frequently displaying severe radiographic and histopathological changes at the time of diagnosis. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids reduced the odds of short-term mortality.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex remains a significant cause of calf morbidity and mortality in both dairy and beef production in the UK. The respiratory tract offers a vulnerable interphase between the animal and the viruses and commensal bacteria involved in the complex. The defence systems of the respiratory tract are described and the main factors that impair these are explained, allowing a systematic farm specific approach to the management and prevention of BRD to be developed. The article is further informed by the experience and views of four bovine practitioners.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of ciclosporin in cats with allergic skin disease. Methods: Ten cats with signs of allergic skin disease were administered ciclosporin daily at a dose of 3·6 to 8·3 mg/kg for one month. None of these cats had previously responded to a hypoallergenic diet trial, and all animals had previously been treated with endectoparasiticidal drugs, with no improvement two weeks before entering the trial. On days 0 and 30, owners assessed pruritus with a visual analogue scale, and veterinarians evaluated cutaneous lesions. Results: All the cats had pruritus and erythema, five had alopecia, two had an eosinophilic plaque, one had miliary dermatitis and two had both alopecia and an eosinophilic plaque. Good or excellent improvement was observed in 40 per cent of cats for pruritus, 57 per cent of cats for alopecia and 60 per cent of cats for erythema. A significant decrease in mean scores was observed for pruritus only, while for erythema and alopecia, it was close to being significant (P<0·052). Clinical Significance: Ciclosporin may be helpful in symptomatically treating signs of feline allergic skin disease. However, it is important to remember that ciclosporin is not licensed for use in cats.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides the interventional oncology (IO) clinician with the basics of veterinary oncology in regards to the current tumor staging systems for relevant tumors. The most common staging system is the World Health Organization (WHO) TNM staging system. Specifically this is based on the size and/or extent of the primary tumor (T), presence or absence of lymph node involvement (N), and whether metastasis (M), has occurred. The chapter presents an understanding of the chemotherapy basics, including commonly used drugs, proper administration, disposal, toxicities and their associated grading schemes, and the basics of radiation therapy (RT). RT may be used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, as well as a single modality or concurrently to chemotherapy. The chapter also provides an introduction to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their expanding use in veterinary medicine, and standard criteria for defining responses in an effort to further standardize studies that evaluate cancer therapies.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) remains a major clinical problem and is often refractory to current treatments. New analgesic medications and strategies for pain relief are needed. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to be a multi-functional growth factor and regulates various biological activities. Methods We investigated the analgesic effect and underlying mechanism of plasmid pUDK-HGF encoding human HGF gene on CPSP induced by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in rats. The possible changes of inflammatory factors, glial cell activation and pain sensitivity after pUDK-HGF administration were investigated by ELISA, western blot and Von Frey tests, respectively. Results In behavioural assays, we found that a single intramuscular or intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF significantly attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation of plantar ipsilateral hind paw after SMIR. Intramuscular injection of pUDK-HGF promoted blood flow and proliferation of satellite cells and inhibited inflammatory cells recruitment, collagen accumulation and expression of pronociceptive factors. Intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF inhibited activation of spinal glial cells and production of inflammatory mediators induced by SMIR. Conclusions pUDK-HGF has a strong analgesic potency and efficacy in CPSP induced by SMIR in rats. This study highlights a new strategy for the treatment of CPSP. Significance The CPSP occurs following various surgical procedures and remains a major clinical problem due to the lack of study on the mechanisms of CPSP. Our findings provide the first evidence that pUDK-HGF attenuates SMIR-induced pain behaviuors through peripheral or central mechanisms. The peripheral analgesic effect of pUDK-HGF is associated with promoting tissue repair and inhibiting inflammatory response; furthermore, pUDK-HGF inhibits activation of spinal glial cells and overexpression of inflammatory mediators in spinal cord. Therefore, naked pUDK-HGF may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of CPSP in clinic.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - Double layer dermal substitute (DS) consist of a 3-dimensional collagen structures and a superficial silicon layer that are positioned within the defect provide to promote tissue regeneration in skin wounds. DS often have unique physical characteristics due to differences in manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study is the clinical and histological comparison of Nevelia and Integra double layer DSs in patients with post-traumatic injury wounds. Thirty patients with post-traumatic wounds localised on the inferior limbs were randomised in 2 groups Nevelia or Integra, followed by autologous dermal epidermal graft (DEG). Clinical results were evaluated through the healing time; Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks and after 1 and 3 years. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation were performed at 0, 2, and 3 weeks. The difference in healing time between groups (P?=?.467, log-rank test), pain and self-estimation was not statistically significant after 35, 42, and 49 days and at 1-year follow up. Histological data showed evident healing of wound after 2 weeks compared with preoperative with both DSs. At 3 weeks reepithelialisation and dermal regeneration were evident with both substitutes; however Nevelia showed early regenerative properties in terms of epidermal proliferation and dermal renewal compared with Integra. Nevelia showed also a more evident angiogenesis vs Integra evaluated as α-SMA immunohistochemistry. Differences in the MSS score were statistically significant at 3 years follow up in favour of Nevelia group (P?=?.001). At long-term follow up, Nevelia showed a better clinical outcome measured as MSS score vs Integra measured as MSS. Histological and immunohistochemistry data showed that Nevelia allows faster neoangiogenesis and tissue regeneration with neoformed tissue architecture closer to the physiology of the skin.
