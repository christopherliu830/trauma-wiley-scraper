AB  - Double layer dermal substitute (DS) consist of a 3-dimensional collagen structures and a superficial silicon layer that are positioned within the defect provide to promote tissue regeneration in skin wounds. DS often have unique physical characteristics due to differences in manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study is the clinical and histological comparison of Nevelia and Integra double layer DSs in patients with post-traumatic injury wounds. Thirty patients with post-traumatic wounds localised on the inferior limbs were randomised in 2 groups Nevelia or Integra, followed by autologous dermal epidermal graft (DEG). Clinical results were evaluated through the healing time; Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks and after 1 and 3 years. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation were performed at 0, 2, and 3 weeks. The difference in healing time between groups (P?=?.467, log-rank test), pain and self-estimation was not statistically significant after 35, 42, and 49 days and at 1-year follow up. Histological data showed evident healing of wound after 2 weeks compared with preoperative with both DSs. At 3 weeks reepithelialisation and dermal regeneration were evident with both substitutes; however Nevelia showed early regenerative properties in terms of epidermal proliferation and dermal renewal compared with Integra. Nevelia showed also a more evident angiogenesis vs Integra evaluated as α-SMA immunohistochemistry. Differences in the MSS score were statistically significant at 3 years follow up in favour of Nevelia group (P?=?.001). At long-term follow up, Nevelia showed a better clinical outcome measured as MSS score vs Integra measured as MSS. Histological and immunohistochemistry data showed that Nevelia allows faster neoangiogenesis and tissue regeneration with neoformed tissue architecture closer to the physiology of the skin.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Insulin resistance (IR) can be difficult to diagnose from basal insulin and glucose concentrations, so a field-based oral sugar test (OST) is preferred. However, the repeatability of this test has not been reported. Objectives To determine the repeatability of an in-feed OST in ponies. Study design A repeated measures, longitudinal study. Methods Eight mixed-breed ponies received an in-feed OST at 08.00?h, after an overnight fast, once weekly for 3 weeks. D-glucose powder (0.75?g/kg bwt), wheat bran (200?g) and water (500?ml) were combined, and mixed with lucerne chaff (0.3% bwt). Blood samples were taken before, and 90 and 180?min after, feeding. All meals were consumed. Blood glucose concentration was determined immediately and serum was obtained for insulin determination by equine-specific ELISA. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose:insulin ratios were used to classify ponies as IR, compensated IR or normal on each occasion and the results were compared to the OST. Results Diagnosis of IR from basal values was consistent in only 3/8 ponies, with a large mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 51% for baseline insulin, across tests. The OST results were repeatable in 7/8 ponies, with mean CV at 25% for the 90?min insulin sample (CV for 7 ponies: 19%). The OST was repeatable on 2/3 occasions in the eighth pony, however, resting hyperinsulinaemia meant that IR was diagnosed on 3/3 occasions using basal values in this pony. There was significant (P<0.05) variability in insulin concentration at 180?min, but not 90?min, across tests. Conclusions An OST is more repeatable when assessing IR in ponies than basal values/ratios. Both resting hyperinsulinaemia and insulin responses to oral sugar can be assessed with the OST, which increases the likelihood of accurately diagnosing IR. Blood sampling at 90?min post feeding is recommended for more consistent results.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Pretoria (Study V040-13). Informed, written consent for participation was obtained from the owners of each of the studs included in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are approximately 100 million working equids in developing countries worldwide. These animals? role in impoverished communities is generally unrecognised by national and international policy makers and their needs are overlooked in national animal health systems. Additionally, despite increased international development attention on women and livestock, the specific contributions of equids to poor womens? lives are also unquantified and overlooked. Objectives This study aimed to document the relationship between working equids and women in equine owning communities in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Pakistan. Study design Qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions elicited opinions from small groups of women (up to 12/group) in selected rural and peri-urban areas in each country. Methods An experienced local language-speaking community facilitator guided each discussion using a standardised questionnaire based on UK Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods framework asset categories. Women's experiences of working equids? roles in their lives were audio-recorded, transcribed in local language and key themes summarised in English. Results Twenty-two discussions (7 in India, 5 each in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan) comprising 259 women took place between February and October 2013. When asked to rank their livestock, all 12 groups in India and Kenya and 17 out of 22 groups overall ranked equids most important, due to their income generation and contribution to household chores, including transporting feedstuffs and water for other livestock species. Whilst specific responsibilities varied between communities, women reported undertaking many equine husbandry activities but lacked access to equine-specific knowledge and skills training. Conclusions The study findings can inform development of targeted training interventions for female working equid owners and users. Further work is required to quantify the contribution to livelihoods of working equids in developing countries to underpin engagement with government stakeholders on the benefit of providing for their needs in animal health and welfare systems.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Real-time tissue elastography (RTE) can provide objective information associated with mechanical properties of tendon tissue and add value to the structural information obtained by greyscale ultrasound. Serial RTE assessment would be useful for monitoring and optimising safe rehabilitation for horses with tendon injury. Objectives To test the hypothesis that RTE could measure change in tissue stiffness in the healing process of injured superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses. Study design Prospective field study. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses with SDFT injury and standardised rehabilitation were used. Both greyscale and RTE images were recorded approximately every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks from occurrence. Greyscale ratio (GR: dividing the grey-value of injured area by it of surrounding noninjured area) and strain ratio (SR: dividing the strain value of stand-off gel pad, which can be a standard, by it of injured area) was calculated at each examination. Tissue strain is displayed by colour which suggests hard (blue), intermediate (yellow), soft (red) on RTE image. Strain of injured area was evaluated by colour-scale grade (CSG) of 1 to 3 (1; blue to green, 2; yellow and 3; red) by 3 veterinarians who didn't know the case history. Results GR was returned to nearly 1 quickly within 8 weeks and it was unchanged thereafter. This continuous change of GR was best-fitted to logarithmic trendline (r2?=?0.66). SR increased gradually up to the last examination and was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.89). CSG was decreased gradually and it was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.84). Both change of SR and CSG suggested that an injured tissue would gradually increase in stiffness. Conclusions RTE could provide useful information regarding monitoring and optimising restoration of the tissue stiffness of tendon, even if GR was unchanged by progress of scar formation, for safer and more effective rehabilitation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is limited information on tarsocrural arthroscopy for osteochondrosis dissecans lesions (OCD) in Great Britain, and routine examination of the plantar pouch has not been described. Objectives To describe clinical features of cases undergoing tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD and estimate the prevalence of abnormalities within the plantar pouch. Study design Retrospective case review. Methods Case records of all horses that had tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD at Rossdales Equine Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included (n?=?99). Descriptive data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed in Microsoft Excel. Results Warmbloods/Warmblood-crosses were significantly over-represented compared to the normal hospital population, comprising 42.4% (CI 32.7?52.2%) of the study (P<0.001), followed by Thoroughbreds/Thoroughbred-crosses (33.7%, CI 25.0?43.7%), 22 other horse breeds and one pony. Cases were predominantly male (70.7%, CI 63.6?81.3%) with 48.5% geldings, 19.2% colts and 3.0% stallions. Median age was 2.9 years (0.1?13.5 years) and median weight was 523?kg (112?919?kg). Most were nonracing sports horses (40.4%, CI 30.7?50.1%), or unbroken (27.0%, CI 18.5?36.0%) with the remainder used for breeding, general purpose or racing. Reasons for presentation were lameness (52.7%, CI 42.5?63.0%), effusion (36.3%, CI 26.4?46.1%), or survey radiographs (11.0%, CI 4.6?17.4%). Tarsocrural arthroscopy was most frequently performed bilaterally (41.8%, CI 32.1?51.6%), followed by left hind (35.7%, CI 26.2?45.2%), then right hind (22.4%, CI 14.2?30.7%). Irrespective of pathology in the dorsal pouch, examination of the plantar pouch was performed in 70 joints (50 horses), and in 78.0% (CI 66.5?89.5%) abnormalities were found. Of these, 10 required removal of organised fibrinous debris or osteochondral fragments (25.6% CI 11.9?39.3%), none of which were recorded using diagnostic imaging presurgery. Conclusions Investigation of the plantar pouch is indicated in routine tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD as it often reveals additional pathology, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Further work will evaluate how plantar pouch pathology may influence prognosis. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained, project number AHT48-2013.

AB  - A five-year-old, male crossbreed rabbit was referred for acute caudal abdominal swelling. On physical examination, the rabbit was slightly depressed and showed an enlarged subcutaneous cyst in the caudal abdomen and an adjacent small, ulcerated solid mass. A drainage tube was placed in the cystic area, and surgical resection of the solid mass was performed. The histopathological diagnosis of the mass was apocrine adenocarcinoma. To the authors? knowledge, this report describes the first case of spontaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma of possible sweat gland origin in a male rabbit.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of perioperative fatality compared with humans and companion animals. Multiple studies have examined the risk factors associated with general anaesthesia, most notably the ongoing confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF) studies initially published by Johnston et?al. [1]. Desflurane is a modern inhalational anaesthetic with low solubility and potentially beneficial reduced cardiorespiratory effects, but its use in a large number of horses has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the perioperative mortality rates of horses undergoing general anaesthesia maintained using desflurane. Study design Retrospective analysis. Methods Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing general anaesthesia over a 4-year period at a single hospital were retrospectively examined. Horses were excluded if general anaesthesia was not maintained using inhaled desflurane. Outcome variables of dead (anaesthetic related), alive or euthanased (for other reasons) were recorded consistent with previous CEPEF studies. Results 427 horses met the inclusion criteria, of which 406 (95.1%) were alive at 7 days post operatively, 16 (3.7%) were euthanased and 5 (1.2%) died. Four of the perioperative fatalities suffered cardiac arrest, one suffered a catastrophic fracture. Mean age was 7.6 years (range 1 month?26 years), mean weight was 503.3?kg (range 60?828?kg). Mean duration of anaesthesia was 63.0?min (range 15?200?min). Mean recovery time to standing was 28.3?min (range 5?70?min) with mean recovery score 1.4/5 (range 1?4). Conclusions Use of desflurane led to comparable mortality rates to other inhalational anaesthetics in this small number of horses at a single hospital. Further multicentre studies with larger numbers are warranted to examine any potential benefits.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of equine lameness frequently requires a period of rest and restricted exercise. The financial impact of restricted exercise should be considered when making investigation and treatment decisions. Objectives To describe and quantify the cost and time commitment associated with horse maintenance in the UK and to quantify the incidence of lameness and number of days of exercise lost. Study design Online survey of UK horse owners. Methods An online survey was performed between June and November 2013. The questionnaire contained 35 open and closed questions related to 1) owner age, gender, geographical location; and 2) type and use of horse, purchase price, location, travel, healthcare and maintenance costs; and 3) lameness episodes within the last 12 months. Results 560 respondents fully completed the questionnaire, 98.2% were female aged between 16 and 54 years old. Horses (62.5% geldings, 37.1% mares, 0.8% stallions) were of mixed breed with a median age of 13 years. Horses were predominantly used for general purpose riding. Most horses were kept on or within 5 miles of the owner's residence (77.4%) and 65% of owners spent >10?h per week on horse maintenance. Median basic maintenance cost was £2660 per year or £7.29 per day including routine healthcare, dentistry, farriery, feed, housing, and insurance fees. Most horses (71.3%) experienced an episode of lameness within the previous 12 months. The median duration of restricted exercise (days wasted) was 70 (range 0?880) days. Conclusions This unique dataset quantifies the financial and time outlay required with horse ownership. Determining the number of wasted days and basic average cost per day has allowed us to quantify the cost of inactivity. Considerable cost is associated with a period of inactivity following an episode of lameness, which should be taken into account when considering investigation and treatment options.

AB  - This study was performed primarily to clarify whether pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection is possible using postmortem imaging (PMI), and whether this is worthwhile. A total of 33 cadavers that underwent systematic anatomical dissection at our medical school also underwent PMI. Fixative solution was injected into the corpus 3?4 days after death. PMI was then performed using an 8-slice multi-detector CT scanner 3 months before dissection. Before dissection, a conference was held to discuss the findings of the PMI. First, two radiologists read the postmortem images without any medical information and deduced the immediate cause of death. Then, the anatomy instructor revealed the medical information available. Based on this information, the radiologist, anatomy instructor, and pathologists suggested candidate sampling sites for pathological examination. On the last day of the dissection period, the pathologists resected the sample tissues and processed them for pathological examination. In 12 of 33 cases, the presumed causes of death could be determined based on PMI alone, and revision of the cause of death described in the death certificate was considered in five (15.2%) cases, based on PMI and pathological analysis. This article presents a novel method of pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection using PMI without disturbing the anatomy education of medical students.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Soaked grass hays are recommended for the nutritional-management of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Forage provision is commonly restricted to promote weight-loss and insulin-sensitivity. When EMS animals were fed hay at ?1.25% body mass (BM) as daily dry matter (DM) (presoaking) animals lost weight at 1.1% of outset BM weekly. This doubled weight-losses recorded when horses were fed fresh/?un-soaked? hay to the same level [1]. Objectives To compare the composition and digestibility of fresh/soaked grass-hays to improve nutritional-guidance for the management of EMS. Study design Following 6 weeks of dietary restriction to 1.25%BM as hay-DM, 6/12 horses which had participated in an earlier study [2], were used to determine the digestibility of the soaked (n?=?3) and fresh (n?=?3) hays. Methods Samples of fresh grass-hay (n?=?6) and hay from the same batch which had been water-soaked overnight (16?h, n?=?6) or by day (7?h, n?=?6) were dried for the measurement of DM content, pooled and ground. Nutrient and gross energy (GE) compositions were determined by proximate analyses. Animals were fed hay as 2 daily meals. Soaked-hay was equal-parts long/short-soaked. Apparent digestibilities were determined after total faecal collection for 72?h. Results Soaking hay; did not alter GE (17.6?MJ/kg DM), increased acid detergent fibre (ADF) (30?35%), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (68?74%) and crude protein (CP, 8.4?10.6%), decreased water soluble carbohydrate (WSC, 18.2?12.2%), and mineral contents (5.7?4.2%). Digestibilities of GE, DM, ash, NDF and WSC were unaltered by soaking. Conversely, soaking increased CP (55.6?66.8%) and ADF (37.5?50%) digestibility. However, hay-soaking elicits un-quantified losses of DM. Previous studies report hay ADF and CP as ?water-insoluble?. When DM losses were retrospectively calculated from the ADF and CP content of fresh and soaked-hays, daily DM provision decreased from 1.25 to 1.14%. Consequently DE decreased by 25% (119.5?89.7?kj/kg BM/day). Conclusions Dry matter losses from hay-soaking have marked impacts on energy/nutrient provision and increase the severity of dietary restriction.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To introduce and assess the feasibility of multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in horses. Objectives To assess latency times of muscular motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the m. extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the m. tibialis cranialis (TC), elicited by transcranially applied multipulse stimulation in 12 healthy horses. Study design Prospective observational study applied in 12 healthy horses. Methods Horses with a mean age of 11.0 (range 3.6?20.5) years and a height of 160 (s.d.?±?10.0) cm were studied. Horses were sedated with detomidin (1.5??g/kg bwt) and butorphanol (1.5??g/kg bwt) i.v. A subcutaneous ring block with lidocaine 2%?+?adrenaline was placed on the forehead. TES was performed using biphasic high frequency multipulse voltage trains (pulse width: 0.1?ms, interpulse interval: 1.3?ms, 3 pulses/train) applied to 2 subcutaneous needle electrodes bilateral from the centre of the forehead. Latency times (30?V above motor threshold (MT) and amplitude of MEP were recorded bilaterally at the ECR and the TC muscles. Motor latency times are expressed as mean?±?2?s.d. Results Mean latency times (at MT?+?30?V) for the ECR muscles were respectively 20.18?±?1.85?ms (left side) and 19.7?±?1.69?ms (right side) and for the TC muscles respectively: 34.6?±?2.01?ms (left) and 34.9?±?2.43?ms (right). Conclusions TES is well tolerated. Interestingly, recorded motor latency times at the level of front and hind legs appear to be shorter for TES when compared to TMS from literature data [1].

AB  - Reasons for performing study We have already demonstrated that vaccination with empty BPV1 capsids termed virus-like particles (VLP) protects horses from experimental infection with BPV1 virion. Long-term monitoring of antibody titres in experimental horses and data from other species suggest that this protection is long lasting. Objectives To test protection against experimental infection with BPV-1 virion in horses that were vaccinated with BPV-1 L1 VLP approximately 5 years earlier. Study design Controlled experiment. Methods Seven horses, vaccinated 3 times (boosters after 4 weeks and 6 months) in 2007/2008 with doses of BPV1 L1 VLP ranging from 50??g to 150??g/dose and 3 unvaccinated control horses were challenged by intra-dermal inoculation with cow wart derived BPV1 virion (5???107 BPV-1 virions per wheal, 10 wheals per horse). Inoculation sites were monitored for 10 weeks. Blood for serum antibody titre determination by pseudovirion neutralisation assay was taken on the day of challenge and after 6 months. Results Six of 7 vaccinated horses had measurable serum antibody titres (1:50 to 1:400). These titres were boosted by inoculation (about one step of dilution). Two of 3 unvaccinated controls remained sero-negative. One control horse showed sero-conversion. All control horses developed tumours at all 10 inoculation sites. Tumours appeared approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and reached maximum sizes of up to 8?mm. Regression was complete by 8 weeks after their first appearance in all horses. All vaccinated horses remained completely free from tumours. No influence of dose rate or antibody titre on the level of protection could be determined. Conclusions BPV-1 L1 VLP vaccination proves to be fully effective in protecting horses from experimental infection and tumour formation 5 years post immunisation. The protection was complete even in horses with low or unmeasurable antibody titres. This is another step towards establishing a vaccination against equine sarcoids.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Most complications in equine castrations result from insufficient ligation and contamination. Objectives Stapling instruments reduce tissue handling, decrease surgical time, minimise contamination and provide secure visceral and vascular closure when used correctly. Using a stapler device might therefore increase ligation security and decrease contamination, and by this, reduce the complication rate seen in routine castration. Study design The applicability and safety of a TA-30 premium stapler as a ligation method in castration of the horse was tested in 15 horses under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Three horses were cryptorchids, one horse suffered a scirrous chord, and one horse suffered an infectious orchitis. Methods The vaginal process was approached inguinally. A noncutting emasculator was applied to compress the closed vaginal process. Consecutively a TA-30 Premium stapler was applied to the compressed site. The distal part of the vaginal process was then removed, the stapler device was released and the incision was closed. The TA-30 stapler accommodates 3 different staple cartridges of 30?mm width, accommodating 1.0 to 2.5?mm tissue thickness. The thickness of the vaginal process after compression was measured to be 1.0?mm (0.9?1.1?mm) in 10 fresh specimens. The 30-V3 cartridges (triple row, 1?mm closed diameter) were chosen in 9 horses with smaller vaginal processes and the 30-3.5 cartridges (double row 1.5?mm closed diameter) in 6 other horses with larger vaginal processes. Results All horses recovered without intra- or post operative complications. Conclusions A TA-30 stapler is a safe ligation instrument in equine castrations. The use of titanium staples may reduce infection rate in routine castrations, even more in ligation of precontaminated vaginal processes in cases of post operative haemorrhage control after practice castrations or in closing the vaginal process after the removal of an infected testis or scirrous chord.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It is unknown how students develop lameness assessment skills. Objectives To quantify student performance, visual approaches and attitudes to lameness evaluation. Study design Comparison of student cohorts. Methods Twenty 3rd year (inexperienced cohort) and thirteen 4th to 5th year (experienced cohort) students evaluated 30 video clips showing horses on the straight line or circle, followed by a general questionnaire. Eyetracking records (Tobii X102) were collected in parallel. The percentage of correctly evaluated horses was calculated based on verified expert opinion. From the eyetracking records on the straight line, the percentage time spent on different regions on the horse was calculated and compared between cohorts. Results For both cohorts, while the correct detection of lameness per se was high (median ≥92%), detection of the correct limb was lower (median 40?80% depending on quarters and cohort) and detection of sound horses was at chance level (median?=?50%). The correct limb was indicated significantly more often by the experienced cohort (P?≤?0.032) except for forelimb lameness on the circle (P?=?0.053). The inexperienced cohort dedicated more time to looking at limb movement, while the experienced cohort focused on head and pelvis movement. Students judged their expected task performance realistically, on average underestimating themselves slightly by around 8%. The task difficulty was rated as a mean (s.d.) of 4.10 (0.48) out of 5 by the inexperienced and 3.35 (0.47) by the experienced cohort. Conclusions Lameness detection skills evolve and improve over the course of the curriculum, with a shift from limb assessment to upper body assessment. Students must learn to reliably determine soundness, and hindlimb lameness proved more difficult than forelimb lameness. Students find lameness detection comparatively difficult, but have a realistic understanding of their skill level, suggesting that they can determine their needs for further practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in horses has not been evaluated. Objectives 1) To establish a technique for measuring MPS?in vivo in the horse using a labelled amino acid tracer and 2) to determine basal MPS in the horse using this technique. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg bwt D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) i.v. and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?h. Pharmacokinetic modelling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% plasma enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6?h of infusion and the effect of treadmill exercise and sedation (0.4?mg/kg bwt) were also determined. Horses subsequently received the calculated D5-Phe infusion rate and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected after 1 and 3?h, allowing basal MPS to be calculated. Precursor intramuscular phe labelling was measured by GC-MS and tracer phe incorporation into muscle myofibrillar protein was determined using GC-pyrolysis-IRMS to calculate fractional synthetic rate. Results The mean rate of whole body phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56??mol/kg bwt/h (s.d. 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41??mol/kg bwt (s.d. 8.8). From this a priming dose of 3.3??mol/kg bwt and an infusion rate of 4.5??mol/kg bwt/h D5-Phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently confirmed to achieve steady state tracer enrichment from 5.6?9.1 APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). D5-Phe incorporation revealed a basal FSR of 0.029%/h (s.d. 0.013) in the horse. Conclusions D5-Phenylalanine is a suitable amino acid tracer for measurement of MPS in the horse yielding rates of MPS in line with other large mammals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Combinations of α2-adrenoceptor and opioid agonists are commonly used in equines, but there is little scientific information on this topic in donkeys. Objectives To compare the sedative and hypoalgesic effects of 4 dosages of butorphanol in xylazine-premedicated donkeys. Study design In vivo experiment. Methods Six donkeys received intravenous treatments: saline and saline (S-S); xylazine (0.5?mg/kg bwt) and saline (X-S); xylazine and butorphanol 10??g/kg bwt (X-B10); xylazine and butorphanol 20??g/kg bwt (X-B20); xylazine and butorphanol 30??g/kg bwt (X-B30); and xylazine and butorphanol 40??g/kg bwt (X-B40). Sedation score (0?3), head height above ground (HHAG), and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) of the left metacarpus were assessed before and for 120?min after treatment. Areas under the curve (AUC) for 0?30, 30?60 and 60?120?min post treatment were computed for sedation scores (SS-AUC), HHAG (HHAG-AUC) and MNT (MNT-AUC). Differences between treatments were analysed using the Friedman test followed by Dunn's test and repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results All treatments except S-S induced sedation. Butorphanol treatments induced significantly greater SS-AUC0?30 values than those for S-S (P<0.05), but S-S and X-S SS-AUC0?30 values were not significantly different. The HHAG-AUC0?30 values for all treatments were smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.001). For HHAG-AUC30-60, only X-B40 values were significantly smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.05). Compared to S-S, all treatments increased MNT and yielded significantly higher MNT-AUC0?30 values (P<0.001). Treatment X-S yielded significantly lower MNT-AUC0?30 values than those for X-B30 and X-B40 (P<0.05). Only MNT-AUC30?60 values for X-B30 and X-B40 were higher than those for S-S and X-S (P<0.05). Conclusions Xylazine induced sedation and mechanical hypoalgesia that were enhanced by adding butorphanol at 40??g/kg bwt. This drug combination may be suitable for chemical restraint of donkeys undergoing clinical procedures.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.
