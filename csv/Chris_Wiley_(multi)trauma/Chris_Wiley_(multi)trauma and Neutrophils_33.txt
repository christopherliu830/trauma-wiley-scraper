AB  - Reasons for performing study Cervical spine lesions are often suspected in horses with neurological signs, abnormal head/neck position and obscure forelimb lameness. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to image the cervical spine in 3 dimensions in superior anatomical detail; e.g. lesions that cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, small fragments, and osteoarthritis of the articular process joints may be more easily detected. Objectives To investigate if CT and CT myelography of the entire cervical spine is possible in horses, describe the technique used, the type of horses and distribution of cervical lesions detected. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Horses undergoing cervical CT and CT myelography from June 2013 to February 2014 were reviewed. The horses were anaesthetised in left lateral recumbency using continuous intravenous anaesthesia. A Philips Brilliance Big Bore 16 slice scanner and a custom made equine CT table (Solving, Finland) were used. Results Cervical CT was performed on 16 horses, 11 of which also had CT myelography: 12 Warmblood, 2 ponies, 1 Standardbred and 1 Paint Horse. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, and in weight from 406 to 670?kg. Presenting complaints were: neurological symptoms (n?=?8), abnormal head/neck position (n?=?5), forelimb lameness (n?=?4), Horners syndrome (n?=?1). In all cases (n?=?16) the cervical spine from the skull to C7 could be imaged, in 3 cases T1 was imaged and in one case T3. Significant lesions were detected in 14 horses. The sites of the most significant lesions were: C4?C5 (n?=?3), C5?C6 (n?=?2), C6?C7 (n?=?5) and C7?T1 (n?=?2), cervical stenosis C5?T2 (n?=?1) and muscle injury (n?=?1). Length of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 70?min (median 60?min), with one complicated recovery. Conclusions Cervical CT and CT myelography can be performed in large adult horses. CT may be the future gold standard to evaluate equine cervical lesions. Further studies are needed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recommendations for prophylactic vaccination against tetanus in horses vary greatly between countries and have scarce scientific support in the peer-reviewed literature. In human medicine, recommended booster vaccination intervals are also very variable, but are considerably longer than for horses. Objectives To investigate if the duration of antibody titres previously determined to be protective against tetanus are likely to be longer than indicated by several recommended vaccination intervals for horses. Study design Prospective clinical trial. Methods Thirty-four horses were enrolled for basic immunisation with an ISCOM Matrix-combination vaccine (Equilis? Prequenza TE). Horses received the first vaccination at 5?11 months of age, and the second dose 4 weeks later. A third vaccine dose was given 15?17 months after the second dose. Serum tetanus antibody titres were analysed by ToBi ELISA 2 weeks as well as 14?16 months after the second dose. After the third vaccine dose, titres were checked once yearly for 3 years. Results Two weeks after the second dose all horses (34/34) had antibody levels that exceeded 0.03?iu/ml. After 16 months the levels were below 0.03?iu/ml in 5/33 horses. After the third vaccine dose antibody levels remained above 0.03?iu/ml in 25/26 horses for 1 year, 17/17 horses for 2 years, and 9/9 horses for 3 years. Conclusions Horses that undergo basic immunisation with 3 doses of vaccine after the age of 6 months are likely to have serum antibody titres consistent with protection against tetanus for more than 3 years.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Embryo transfer (ET) is an increasingly common component of commercial sport-horse breeding. While many variables affect the success of ET, optimal selection of recipient mares is essential. Ideally, adequate corpus luteum (CL) function would be evaluated by measuring plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations (≥2.0?ng/ml). In practice however, P4 is rarely measured because it would increase costs, and there is a delay to obtaining a result. Colour-flow Doppler sonography (CF) has been described as a rapid means of assessing CL function because luteal blood flow correlates with circulating P4 concentrations. Objectives To use CF to assess luteal blood flow at the time of ET in recipient mares, and assess its relationship to P4 concentrations and pregnancy outcome. Study design Cohort study. Methods Fifty-eight Day 8 horse embryos were transferred as part of a commercial programme. B-mode and CF sonographic examinations were performed immediately prior to ET (ET+0), and blood was collected to measure plasma P4. Measurements were repeated at 4, 11, 18 and 25 days after ET in pregnant mares. Mares scanned not pregnant at Day 4 were re-checked 2 days later. The CF image of each CL was frozen at peak total area of flow, and repeated 3 times. The cross-sectional area (corrected for presence of lacunae) and the total area of colour pixels within the CL were analysed using ImageJ software. Results Plasma P4 correlated positively (P<0.05) with area of colour pixels (range r?=?0.40?0.55) and total CL area (range r?=?0.41?0.51) at all time-points. None of plasma P4, CL area, or CF pixel area were predictive of pregnancy outcome. Conclusions CL blood flow is not predictive of pregnancy outcome but should help identify mares with an inadequate CL and not therefore suitable for receiving an embryo.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horseshoe studs are commonly used to increase traction between the foot and the ground in competition horses. Here we investigate the question of how hindlimb studs alter limb function by quantifying upper body kinematics during circular motion (lungeing). Objectives This study quantified the effects of studs placed in the hind shoes on head and pelvic movement symmetry parameters commonly used for objective assessment of lameness. Study design Prospective longitudinal interventional study. Methods 15 horses were trotted on the straight and lunged on left and right circles on turf with/without a pair of studs in both hind shoes. Movement symmetry was assessed using inertial sensors mounted on poll, os sacrum and left and right tuber coxae. To eliminate the influence of the number of left/right asymmetrical horses in the sample, symmetry values were standardised to show left fore and/or right hind asymmetry on the straight. Differences in standardised head and pelvic symmetry index (SI) with and without studs were calculated and paired t tests were used to compare SI values with and without studs on the straight and on both reins. Results Use of studs resulted in a significant difference (P?=?0.02) in pelvic SI on the right lunge only but no difference for straight line and left lunge (both P>0.05). No significant difference was found for head movement symmetry (all P>0.05). Conclusions Pelvic movement was altered with the ?weaker? right hindlimb (based on the calculation of standardised SI values) on the inside of the circle creating an increased ?hip hike?. In general, horses show increased limb angles and lower peak vertical force with the inside limb; our kinematic results show that this effect is exacerbated with studs. Future studies should investigate whether this ?intervention? is of diagnostic potential in sub-clinically hindlimb lame horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Anthelmintic resistance is a global problem and constitutes a major threat to the welfare of equids worldwide. The cyathostomins are the most numerous and pathogenic gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) of equids in the developed world. Cyathostomins show widespread resistance to 2 out of 3 of the major classes of anthelmintic and recently there are reports of reduced efficacy to the potent macrocyclic lactones (MLs). None of the 3 novel classes of anthelmintic that have emerged in the last decade are licensed for use in equids. The cysteine proteases (CPs) are plant proteins that have shown potent activity against GINs?in vivo in sheep and pigs. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of the CP papain on cyathostomins in vitro using the egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval migration inhibition test (LMIT). Methods Samples of cyathostomin eggs and third stage larvae were collected and cultured from a population of equids that have recently shown reduced ML efficacy in vivo. The EHA and LMIT were performed on repeated samples with increasing concentrations of papain. Dose?response curves were plotted and PROBIT analysis performed on the data to give EC-50 values (concentration that gives 50% of the maximal response). Results Papain caused a dose dependent inhibition of both egg hatch and larval migration. The EC-50 values were 2??mol/l and 100??mol/l in the EHA and LMIT respectively, indicating a more potent effect on egg hatch. Conclusions The CP papain shows potent anthelmintic activity against cyathostomins in vitro. Good evidence of anthelmintic effect against GINs in other host species is supportive of its potential use in equids. Further work is indicated to evaluate safety and in vivo efficacy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Topical administration of atropine is an important part of the treatment of equine uveitis. However, very high doses of topically administered atropine have been associated with decreased gut motility and colic in horses. Objectives To evaluate systemic effects of topical atropine in doses used clinically in horses, with emphasis on gut motility and ability to induce colic. Study design Randomised, blinded, controlled crossover study. Methods Four horses received placebo eye drops (saline) and 2 different protocols of topical atropine administration during 120?h with 35 days washout periods in between different treatments. One drop of 1% atropine solution was administered unilaterally at 3-h intervals for 48?h and at 12-h intervals for another 72?h (high dose), whereas the low dose group was given alternating treatment with atropine and saline according to the same protocol. In the placebo group, saline was administered at 3-h intervals for 48?h and at 12-h intervals for another 72?h. All horses were walked for 10?min 3 times a day. Pupillary light reflexes, heart rate, respiratory rate, gut sounds and clinical signs of abdominal pain were monitored every 3?h and faecal output once daily. Results None of the horses showed any signs of abdominal pain. Gut sounds were present at every auscultation in all horses. Gut sound scores were significantly lower during the high dose regime (P?=?0.0007) compared to placebo, but not during the low dose regime (P?=?0.17). Conclusions Topically administered atropine in clinically relevant doses temporarily reduced gut motility, but did not cause ileus or colic in healthy horses receiving a small amount of daily exercise. However, this effect may be additive to other factors that reduce gut motility in horses with uveitis, such as pain and stress in relation to hospitalisation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used to evaluate the distal aspect of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of lame horses. There is paucity of information comparing interobserver agreement of this imaging modality. Objectives To determine the interobserver agreement for assessment of the DDFT on sMRI using a newly developed grading system. It was hypothesised that different lesion types would be more frequently observed at different anatomical locations of the DDFT, and that interobserver agreement would be better for the presence of a lesion compared to lesion grading. Study design A retrospective study assessing interobserver agreement. Methods sMRI studies of 40 equine front feet were retrospectively graded by 2 observer teams using a newly developed grading system based on previous studies. Individual DDFT parameters and an overall DDFT grade were scored. A Pearson's Chi-square test quantified the association between anatomical location and lesion type and interobserver agreement was quantified by calculating weighted-kappa statistic. Results Observer team B found a statistically significant association between anatomical location and lesion type but observer team A did not. Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the majority of individual DDFT parameters. For most parameters, better interobserver agreement was found for presence of a lesion than for lesion grading. Interobserver agreement was fair for the overall DDFT grade. Conclusions Interobserver agreement was acceptable for overall DDFT grade and was better for the presence of an overall grade. Interobserver agreement was also acceptable for most DDFT parameters and was better for assessing whether a lesion was present compared to the grading of lesions. This study highlights the value of a standardised grading system for assessing the DDFT on sMRI, and provides a method to improve the repeatibilty and reliability of future studies using sMRI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of microscopic pancreatic, hepatic and renal lesions in post-mortem samples from cavalier King Charles spaniels. METHODS The prevalence of microscopic lesions was determined by routine histopathology and compared to ante-mortem clinical signs. RESULTS There was evidence of chronic pancreatitis in 51·9% of the cases, and age correlated with severity. Renal lesions were diagnosed in 52·2% of cases, most of which were inflammatory. Ante-mortem diagnosis of pancreatic and renal disease was 25 and 16·7%, respectively. Primary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 11·1% of cases; secondary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 64·8%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pancreatic and renal lesions are common in cavalier King Charles spaniels, but they have similar rates of hepatic disease as the general population. The increasing prevalence of pancreatic lesions with age suggests that it might be a progressive condition.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There have been no detailed descriptions of the radiological appearance of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament in horses with and without distal hock joint pain. Objectives 1) To describe the normal radiological appearance of the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament; 2) to determine the frequency of occurrence of mineralisation or ossification of the interosseous ligament and to describe radiological abnormalities surrounding the interosseous space; 3) to describe concurrent radiological abnormalities in the tarsus. It was hypothesised that ossification of the interosseous ligament will be associated with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint. Study design Systematic radiological analysis using a predefined grading system, after a repeatability study, and descriptive statistics. Methods Case records and radiographs of all horses which underwent radiographic examination of one or both tarsi over 7 years were reviewed. Results There were 700 horses, including 470 examined bilaterally. The normal interosseous space was an oval-shaped radiolucent area surrounded by subchondral bone of uniform opacity and thickness. Changes in the region of the interosseous ligament of the centrodistal joint were evident in 190/1170 (16.2%) tarsi, including 50 horses examined bilaterally. In 33/190 (17.4%) tarsi there was complete loss of the oval-shaped radiolucent area, together with increased thickness of the adjacent subchondral bone, endosteal irregularity and increased opacity of the adjacent trabecular bone. In addition 157/190 tarsi had patchy increased opacity within the interosseous space and alterations of the adjacent subchondral and trabecular bone. There was radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint in 27/33 (81.8%) of tarsi with complete ossification of the centrodistal interosseous ligament, 17 of which (51.5%) had distal tarsal pain, and in 29/157 (18.5%) tarsi with other abnormalities of the centrodistal interosseous ligament. Conclusions When evaluating the tarsus radiologically the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament should be assessed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are no reports of proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) and concurrent injuries of the proximal aspect of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT). Objectives To describe clinical features, response to local analgesia and ultrasonographic features. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Review of case records, January 2009?2014. Results There were 8 horses with forelimb lameness, 4 unilateral and 4 bilateral (2 with bilateral injuries of the suspensory ligament [SL] and ALDDFT and 2 with PSD and injury of the ALDDFT in one limb and injury of the ALDDFT alone in the other). One horse had pain on palpation of the proximal aspect of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks in 10/12 limbs; in 2 limbs an ulnar nerve block was required to abolish lameness. There were 5 horses with bilateral hindlimb lameness; concurrent desmopathy of the ALDDFT and PSD was identified in one horse. In the other 4 horses there was a history of bilateral PSD which had undergone treatment. Recurrent lameness was associated with unilateral (n?=?3) or bilateral (n?=?1) PSD and desmopathy of the ALDDFT. In 2 horses there was soft tissue swelling in the proximomedial aspect of the metatarsus in the region of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by local infiltration of mepivacaine in the proximoplantar aspect of the metatarsus in 3 limbs; in one limb a tibial nerve block was required to eliminate lameness. In all horses lesions were characterised ultrasonographically by enlargement of both the ALDDFT and the proximal aspect of the SL and a diffuse decrease in echogenicity. There was echogenic material between the SL and ALDDFT in 5 limbs. Conclusions All soft tissue structures in the proximal aspect of the metacarpus/metatarsus should be evaluated ultrasonographically if pain is localised to this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adipose tissue deposited along the crest of the neck has been associated with altered metabolic states and with an increased risk of laminitis in equids. Thickness of the neck is a phenotipic characteristic in Andalusians; however, there are no studies evaluating this condition in this breed. Objectives To evaluate morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements in the neck area for assessment of neck adiposity and its associations with adiposity scores and biochemical variables. Study design A sample of 115 Andalusian horses (46 barren mares and 69 stallions, 2?15 years old) was evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Methods Cresty neck score (CNS) was determined. Two groups were created: cresty neck (CNS?≥?3) and noncresty neck (CNS<3) horses. Neck circumference (NC) (cm) and ultrasonography (US) of subcutaneous fat (mm) at 25% (NC0.25?US0.25), 50% (NC0.50?US0.50) and 75% (NC0.75?US0.75) of neck length were measured. Middle neck circumference (NC), neck length and height at the withers were taken to calculate neck ratios (NC0.50:height, NC0.50:neck length). Plasma was analysed for insulin and leptin. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as insulin ≥20??iu/ml. Correlations using Pearson and Spearman coefficients were evaluated. Mean comparisons were carried out with Student's t or Mann-Whitney tests. Results Cresty neck condition was present in 73.9% (n?=?85) of the horses and 2.6% (n?=?3) were hyperinsulinaemic. Cresty neck horses had significantly higher plasma leptin, morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements. NC0.50:height was the most correlated parameter with CNS. Insulin was correlated with leptin levels and all morphometric measurements. Insulin and leptin were correlated only with US0.75. Conclusions Andalusian horses? neck score, despite their thick necks in the majority of individuals, does not have a good correlation with plasma insulin and leptin levels. Since in Andalusian horses, neck scores may be overestimating obesity, further studies on ultrasonographic fat measurements are needed. Ethical animal research:?The university committee for the ethical use of animals approved all procedures. Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Advanced imaging modalities enable assessment of the equine skull and brain. Horses are susceptible to neurological dysfunction of the cranial nerves; however, our understanding of these structures? imaging anatomy is limited. Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine the prevalence of EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5 in respiratory samples from a large number of horses using quantitative PCR methods. Samples from horses with, and without mild signs of respiratory disease provided an opportunity to examine associations with single or multiple herpesviral infections. Objectives To determine any correlation between quantitative detection of these equine herpesviruses and mild clinical respiratory disease in horses. Methods Nasal swabs were taken from horses with, and without, clinical respiratory disease. Nucleic acid was extracted from all swabs prior to PCR testing for EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5. Clinical signs of respiratory disease included coughing, fever (temperature >38.5°C) or nasal discharge. Results Of the 409 horses, 250 (61%) were clinically normal, 121 (30%) presented with clinical signs consistent with mild respiratory disease and 38 (9%) horses had no traceable clinical history. One-fifth (83/409) of horses sampled were infected with EHV-2 and almost two-thirds 249/409 (60.9%) with EHV-5. Infection with EHV-5 was significantly associated with mild respiratory disease (85/121; 70.2%) compared to nondiseased horses (137/249; 55%) P?=?0.005. The proportion of EHV-2 infected horses, however, did not differ significantly between those in the diseased (18/121) and nondiseased (61/250) groups. Too few horses were detected with alphaherpesviruses to determine any association with clinical signs of disease. Mean nasal shedding loads of herpesviruses were not significantly different between diseased and nondiseased horses. Conclusions There was a significant association between horses displaying clinical signs of mild respiratory disease and infection with EHV-5, however, no such association was evident for neither horses with EHV-2 nor the alphaherpesviruses EHV-1 and -4. The clinical significance of respiratory gammaherpesvirus infections in horses remains yet to be determined; however, these findings add to the mounting body of evidence incriminating EHV-5 in association with equine respiratory disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Some ponies are predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis, but the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically active tissue that secretes mediators which affect vascular function, insulin signalling and inflammation, all of which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of laminitis. Objectives To determine whether the gene expression of adipose tissue from previously laminitic ponies (LP) differs from nonlaminitic ponies (NL). Study design Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected by biopsy from the neck region of healthy LP and NL (n?=?6 each group) in the summer and winter. Methods Gene expression was determined using a 44?K equine expression microarray. Data were analysed using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes with >2-fold difference, P<0.01 were considered significant using a t test to analyse group and/or season. Results The most significant differences in global gene expression in adipose tissue were observed between summer and winter in both groups, with 244 (NL) and 174 (LP) genes differentially expressed. There was a significant difference between LP and NL groups in the summer (141 genes differentially expressed), whereas the 2 groups were more similar in the winter (40 genes differentially expressed). Eight of the top 10 upregulated genes and 3 of the top 5 canonical pathways that differed between LP and NL in the summer were associated with inflammation and/or immunity. Conclusions Laminitic ponies appear to have a different adipose tissue gene expression profile to NL, particularly in the summer. Inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in the LP group suggesting higher levels of inflammation or priming of inflammatory pathways which may contribute to a predisposition to laminitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Since 2010, the OIE expert surveillance panel (ESP) recommends that EI vaccines contain representative equine influenza virus (EIV) strains from the Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages for optimal protection against EIV currently circulating worldwide. To date, no EI vaccine commercially available in the EU meets this recommendation. Objectives This report summarises the development process of a fully updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, including clinical efficacy results against EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. Study design The EI vaccine ProteqFlu containing 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of EIV strains was updated by replacing the A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 strain with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 isolate (Florida clade 2 sub-lineage) and keeping A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 sub-lineage), to meet the last OIE recommendations. The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy in the Welsh mountain pony model. Methods The mode of action, production steps and efficacy of the updated EI vaccine will be presented. Efficacy was tested in a group of 7 ponies vaccinated twice, 5 weeks apart. Protective antibody response were measured and challenged by experimental infection with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 EIV strain. Clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with control unvaccinated ponies (n?=?7). Results Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. Conclusions The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was already the first EI vaccine to meet the 2004 OIE ESP recommendations and was successfully used in Australia during the 2007 EI outbreak. This new version will be the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift. EI vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to prevent or limit the impact of EI, as clearly illustrated by the limited frequency and scale of EI outbreaks.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinicopathological and laboratory investigation of horses showing severe neurological signs during the 2010 WNV-lineage 2 human epidemic in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece). Implementation of preventive measures was also addressed. Objectives To describe the clinical signs, supportive treatment and outcome in WNV cases and report the use of an inactivated WNV vaccine used for the protection of horses during the following epidemic periods. Study design Clinical study. Methods Laboratory testing included serology, real-time RT-PCR and histopathology. All affected animals received supportive treatment (furosemide, dexamethasone, B-complex vitamins and NSAIDs). The Equip WNV vaccine was used for immunisation of horses. Results WNV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 17 horses with neurological signs. The specificity of the detected antibodies was confirmed by seroneutralisation tests. The maximum duration of IgM was determined to be 60 days. Clinical signs included weakness of hindlimbs, ataxia and tremors (17/17), altered mental state (10/17), hypersensitivity (7/17), inability to swallow (3/17), recumbency (3/17) and convulsions (3/17). Supportive treatment was successful in 14/17 horses. The 3 recumbent horses died as a result of the infection, or were subjected to euthanasia. Histopathological findings observed in the CNS were mild perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, axonal swelling, glial nodules, microhaemorrhages and neuronal necrosis. None of the vaccinated horses showed clinical signs. Three unvaccinated horses showed clinical signs and developed WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Conclusions The Nea Santa-Greece-lineage 2 strain responsible for the massive human epidemic of 2010 was also highly pathogenic for horses. Timely administration of supportive treatment is important to the prognosis of the cases. WNV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with encephalitis in Greece. Vaccinations can effectively protect horses, especially in areas of Greece where the virus seems to have become endemic.
