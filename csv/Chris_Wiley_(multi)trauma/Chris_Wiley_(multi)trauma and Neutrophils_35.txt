AB  - Reasons for performing study Epidemiological investigations suggest that soil macro- and micro-nutrients may be a trigger for the occurrence of equine grass sickness (EGS). However, there is limited information regarding relationships between exposure to geochemical elements and the occurrence of EGS. Objectives To determine whether the geographical distribution of EGS cases referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies was associated with the presence or absence of particular geochemical elements in the environment. Study design A retrospective time-matched case?control study. Methods 455 EGS geo-referenced cases were identified between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2006. Each case had 2 time-matched geo-referenced controls (n?=?910). For study purposes, cases or controls originating outwith Scotland were excluded. Environmental concentrations of a range of elements, most with known biological function, were collated from 2 geochemical point datasets and spatially extrapolated giving continuous cover across Scotland: the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) stream sediment dataset and the James Hutton Institute (JHI), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS). Data were analysed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Results Statistically significant associations were obtained between the distribution of EGS cases and (i) higher environmental levels of Ca, K, Mo, Na, Se and Ti, and (ii) lower environmental levels of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. This study identified no association between EGS cases and the environmental concentrations of Ba, Ga, Fe, Mg, Mn, P or Sr. Conclusions A number of statistically significant associations were identified between EGS cases and element concentrations in the spatially extrapolated stream sediment and soil data. This information will assist future studies on the aetiology of EGS, with further research suggested to focus on those identified significant associations with greatest biological plausibility such as reduced levels of Cu and Zn, and higher levels of K and Se.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colostrum acts as a source of immunomodulatory molecules for the neonate. Little information is available about the transfer of cytokines via colostrum in the foal. Objectives To investigate the transfer via colostrum of IL-4, IL-13, IL-8 and IFN-?. Study design Prospective observational study. Methods Jugular venous blood pre- (T0) and post suckling (T24) and colostrum were collected from 14 healthy foals and their dams. The cytokines? concentration was measured with an ELISA test. Serum IgG concentration was measured in foals at T24 with an immunoturbidimetric assay. Since data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests for statistical analysis were used. The Wilcoxon t test evaluated the difference in each cytokine concentration between T0 and T24. Spearman rank correlation tested the association between cytokines? concentration in T24 serum and in colostrum, between T24?T0 (?T) serum concentration and colostrum concentration, and between cytokines serum concentration at T24 and IgG concentration. Results All the foals had a complete transfer of passive immunity. A statistically significant difference was found between serum IL-4 concentration at T0 and at T24. The significant correlations found were: serum IL-4 concentration at T24 with IL-4 concentration in colostrum, serum IL-13 concentration at T24 with IgG serum concentration, and IL-4 concentration in colostrum with ?T serum IL-4 concentration. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that IL-4 is transferred via colostrum to the foal, as reported for TNF-α [1]. The presence of IL-8 in the foal's serum at T0 suggests an endogenous production. The IL-13 concentration is close to zero for the major part of serum and colostrum samples suggesting a subject-dependent immunologic response. The IFN-? is present both in colostrum and in T0 serum suggesting that foals are not deficient at birth.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of different formulations of omeprazole have not been published. Objectives To compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of 4 commercially available formulations of omeprazole to an existing reference formulation. Study design A single dose cross-over bioequivalence study. Methods Six adult Thoroughbred horses were used. Two generic buffered formulations (OG and AG), one commercial enteric coated formulation (GZ) and one compounded enteric coated formulation (BO) were compared to the reference buffered formulation (GG). Each formulation was administered at a total dose of 2?g (equivalent to 4?mg/kg bwt for a 500?kg horse) in a cross-over design. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300 and 360?min, the plasma was separated and frozen. Plasma omeprazole concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using PK Solver. Results The mean (± s.d.) area-under-the-curve (AUC0-t/0-inf_obs) (?g/ml*min), Cmax (?g) and Tmax (min) for each formulation was; OG ? 59.4?±?20.1, 0.37?±?0.12, 87.5?±?38.4; AG ? 77.3?±?53.7, 0.34?±?0.24, 170.0?±?62.0; GZ ? 102.9?±?51.1, 0.86?±?0.68, 67.5?±?29.6; BO ? 88.0?±?37.4, 0.59?±?0.39, 95.0?±?47.1; GG ? 57.5?±?35.3, 0.41?±?0.22, 57.5?±?19.9. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that differences are present between commercially available formulations of omeprazole. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating results of clinical studies from one formulation to another.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A nonchemical method of restraint to facilitate neonatal foal handling and minimally invasive procedures would be highly useful. Objectives To investigate squeeze-induced somnolence for providing adequate restraint of healthy neonatal foals for the purpose of plasma administration. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Squeeze-induced somnolence of neonatal foals was performed by use of a soft rope restraint as previously described [1] to allow intravenous catheterisation and plasma administration. Physiological and clinical parameters were monitored pre-, during and post squeeze-induced somnolence. Results Squeeze-induced somnolence and plasma administration was performed on 14 foals within the first day of life without any adverse effects. Mean time to recumbency during squeeze restraint was 53?s, mean time to stand and mean time to nurse from dam following release of restraint were 46?s and 163?s, respectively. Over 50% of foals gave some reaction to subcutaneous injection of local anaesthetic but only one foal reacted strongly. The restraint technique was performed without any difficulty in 8/14 foals, 5/14 foals became less somnolent latterly in the procedure (around 17?18?min) and one foal never became fully somnolent. Conclusions Squeeze-induced somnolence provides adequate restraint for plasma administration, without the need for sedation, in the majority of neonatal foals. Squeeze-induced somnolence can be used to allow nonchemical restraint of neonatal foals for routine procedures. Further refinement of the technique is required to maximise its potential usefulness.

AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - An intrathoracic mass was discovered as an incidental finding in a 14-year-old, spayed, female Rottweiler cross during evaluation of urinary incontinence. Computed tomography suggested a pericardial or pleural location and high adipose content of the mass. The mass was removed via lateral thoracotomy with partial pericardectomy and was diagnosed as a pericardial lipoma. The dog recovered well, and there was no evidence of recurrence approximately one year later. Adipose tumours of the heart and its associated structures are rare in dogs and have been associated with both successful and fatal outcomes.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - There is an increasing number of inherited disorders in which excessive telomere shortening underlies the molecular defect, with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) being the archetypal short telomere syndrome. DC is classically described as a mucocutaneous triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and abnormal skin pigmentation. However, excessive telomere shortening can affect almost any organ system, so the clinical manifestations are protean, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, exudative retinopathy, aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis, head and neck cancer and dental abnormalities, and may be multi-systemic. Undiagnosed patients may be seen by essentially any medical subspecialist. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure appropriate management, and for initiating investigations to identify affected family members. Treatment is often supportive, with transplantation offering cure for pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. Higher rates of mortality and morbidity with transplantation often require regimen alterations, underscoring the need for correct diagnosis. Short telomeres result from mutations in genes essential for telomere maintenance (e.g. genes encoding subunits of the telomerase enzyme complex). Disease severity reflects not only the severity of the defect, but also the inheritance of short telomeres, giving rise to incomplete penetrance and genetic anticipation. Attendees of the inaugural Australian Short Telomere Syndrome Conference were updated on the current scientific and clinical understanding of these disorders, and discussed the best approach for management of these patients in the Australian context. This review will include recommendations from the conference and aims to increase awareness of short telomere disorders.

AB  - Objectives To characterise the signalment, clinical presentation and therapy of pemphigus foliaceus in cats treated by primary care practitioners. Materials and Methods Retrospective evaluation of patient and treatment factors with the following case outcomes: remission (achieving remission, time to remission), treatment-related adverse effects (number, severity) and final disease outcome (medical control, cure, death or euthanasia). Results Data were obtained from 48 cats with biopsy-confirmed pemphigus foliaceus managed by practitioners from six countries and 47 hospitals. Clinicians prescribed oral prednisolone most commonly for immunosuppression (median dose 2·2 mg/kg/day). Disease remission information was available in 40 cats; 90% achieved disease remission, which did not appear related to the doses of oral glucocorticoid administered in this study. Disease relapse occurred in 29 (73%) cats after achieving remission, necessitating medication adjustments. Severe treatment-related adverse effects occurred in eight cases, including both cats treated with long-acting injectable glucocorticoids. Of 31 cats treated with glucocorticoid monotherapy, 27 achieved remission, as did eight of 11 ciclosporin plus glucocorticoid-treated cats. Eleven cats experienced adverse effects: five receiving ciclosporin plus glucocorticoid and six receiving glucocorticoid monotherapy. Clinical Significance Pemphigus foliaceus remission with treatment is highly likely in cats but relapse is common, necessitating close monitoring and individualised therapy modifications. Clinicians should focus on the judicious use of glucocorticoids to minimise treatment-related adverse effects, such as avoiding injectable glucocorticoids, combining glucocorticoids with steroid-sparing medications, and regularly rechecking patients to adjust drug dosages in response to disease status.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - A 12-year-old, entire, nulliparous crossbreed female dog was presented with a history of vulval bleeding, bulging of the perineum and faecal tenesmus. A firm, non-painful perineal mass, measuring 9·11?5·4 cm, with erythema was detected. Abdominal radiography showed compression and elevation of the rectal ampulla. A dose of 10 mg/kg aglepristone was administered subcutaneously on days 1, 2, 8, 15, 28 and 35. An incision biopsy was taken on day 15 and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the majority of neoplastic cells expressed progesterone receptors. Both the cutaneous erythema and the faecal tenesmus had resolved by day 28. A 50 per cent reduction in size was observed by day 60 (surgical excision). This study shows that benign tumours of the vagina of the dog that contain progesterone receptors can be reduced in size in a palliative or neoadjuvant setting using the progesterone receptor antagonist aglepristone.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are non-hematopoietic multi-potent stem-like cells that are capable of differentiating into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages. In fact, in addition to bone, cartilage, fat, and myoblasts, it has been demonstrated that MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons and astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. MSCs are of interest because they are isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and can be easily expanded in vitro. As such, these cells are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human diseases. Nevertheless, there are still some open questions about origin, multipotentiality, and anatomical localization of MSCs. In this review, we discuss clinical trials based on the use of MSCs in cardiovascular diseases, such as treatment of acute myocardial infarction, endstage ischemic heart disease, or prevention of vascular restenosis through stem cell-mediated injury repair. We analyze data from clinical trials for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is a genetic disease characterized by production of defective type I collagen. We describe progress for neurological disease treatment with MSC transplants. We discuss data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and on lysosomal storage diseases (Hurler syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy). A section of review is dedicated to ongoing clinical trials, involving MSCs in treatment of steroid refractory Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD); periodontitis, which is a chronic disease affecting periodontium and causing destruction of attachment apparatus, heart failure, and bone fractures. Finally, we will provide information about biotech companies developing MSC therapy. J. Cell. Physiol. 211: 27?35, 2007. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Seven days after the injection of different concentrations of thrombin into the nigrostriatal pathway, a strong macrophage/microglial reaction was observed in the substantia nigra (SN), indicated by immunostaining, using OX-42 and OX-6 antibodies, and by the induction of iNOS, IL-1α, Il-1? and TNF-α. Moreover, selective damage to dopaminergic neurones was produced after thrombin injection, evidenced by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA-expressing cell bodies, and the unaltered transcription of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA in the SN and striatum. These thrombin effects could be produced by its ability to induce the activation of microglia described in in vitro studies, and are in agreement with the effects described for other proinflammatory compounds. Thrombin effects are produced by its biological activity since they almost disappeared when thrombin was heat-inactivated or injected along with its inhibitor α-NAPAP. Thrombin is a multi-functional serine protease rapidly produced from prothrombin at the sites of tissue injury, and also upon breakdown of the blood?brain barrier, which strongly suggests it could easily enter into the CNS. These results could have special importance in some degenerative processes of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.

AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - This case report describes congestive heart failure with pleural effusion in two middle-aged, pet house rabbits. Both had a history of acute onset dyspnoea, weakness and weight loss. Bi-atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post-mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

AB  - Fifty cases (36 dogs and 14 cats) with a confirmed diagnosis of pyothorax were evaluated from five referral institutions in the UK and Ireland. Aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of all cases were examined. The underlying cause of pyothorax was determined in 18 per cent of cases. Positive bacteriological cultures of the pleural fluid were obtained in 68·7 per cent of the animals. Treatment modalities included surgery and medical management, involving thoracostomy tube placement, thoracic aspiration, thoracic lavage and antimicrobial therapy. A successful outcome was achieved in 86 per cent of patients.

AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.
