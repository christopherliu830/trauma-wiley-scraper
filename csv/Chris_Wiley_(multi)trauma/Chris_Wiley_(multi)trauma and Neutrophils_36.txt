AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.

AB  - ABSTRACT A retrospective study of 27 dogs with deep mycoses was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of initial laboratory results in determining a diagnosis. Fifteen cases of disseminated blastomycosis, five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis and seven cases of gastrointestinal phycomycosis were studied. Haematologic results consistent with a chronic inflammatory disease (mild to moderate anaemia and moderate to marked monocytosis) were common findings in blastomycosis and phycomycosis. Cases of histoplasmosis were characterized by a more severe anaemia with a neutrophilia and left shift. The severe anaemia present in three out of five (3/5) dogs with histoplasmosis was apparently due to myelophthisis and intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation. Coagulation function tests and/or the haemograms suggested the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis in four dogs with histoplasmosis. Clinical chemistry results in blastomycosis and phycomycosis were usually unremarkable. Hepatic lesions in histoplasmosis were suggested by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and decreases in serum albumin. Cytology was frequently diagnostic for blastomycosis (11/13 cases) and histoplasmosis (3/4 cases) but was inconsistent in phycomycosis (1/3 cases).

AB  - Abstract A 6-year-old, spayed female, domestic shorthair cat was presented to the University of Georgia Veterinary Teaching Hospital for a 3-year history of a nonhealing wound on the right tarsus. The wound temporarily resolved with medical management, but intermittently recurred when antimicrobials were discontinued. At presentation, the wound had become refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Physical examination revealed a 1 cm diameter crust along the medial aspect of the right tarsus. Proximal to the crust, were 2 non-painful, fluctuant swollen areas that were free of drainage. Cytologic evaluation revealed atypical granulated cells, and a mesenchymal neoplasm was interpreted as a top differential diagnosis. Histopathology revealed marked, chronic, multifocal, pyogranulomatous dermatitis with abundant intralesional colonies of gram-positive, acid-fast-negative, filamentous bacteria. PCR and sequencing confirmed the infection to be caused by Actinomadura vinacea.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of cefovecin in the treatment of bacterial skin infections in dogs. Method: Dogs with superficial or deep pyoderma or wounds/abscesses were enrolled in three separate studies. Dogs (354) were randomised to treatment and received either cefovecin administered by subcutaneous injection at 14 day intervals, as clinically necessary, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as oral tablets twice daily for 14 days. Courses of treatment were repeated at 14 day intervals up to a total of four courses. Clinicians responsible for assessing lesions were masked to treatment allocation. Only animals where the presence of a pretreatment bacterial pathogen was confirmed were included in the analysis of efficacy. Cases were evaluated for clinical efficacy at 28 days after initiation of the final course of treatment. Clinical efficacy was assessed by scoring the clinical signs typical of skin infections. Results: Cefovecin demonstrated statistical non-inferiority compared with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for all three clinical diagnoses; for cefovecin, up to 96·9 per cent efficacy was observed versus 92·5 per cent for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical Significance: Cefovecin was shown to be as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid administered orally in the treatment of bacterial skin infections in dogs. Cefovecin offers the additional benefit of eliminating owner non-compliance.

AB  - This series describes five dogs with nasal polyps diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. Clinical signs included reverse sneezing, nasal discharge, epistaxsis, and stertor when breathing. Computerised tomographic findings included soft tissue mass, turbinate destruction, extension through the bony nasal septum and partial lysis of bones surrounding the nasal cavity. Three dogs were treated by dorsal rhinotomy, one dog was treated by ventral rhinotomy, and in one dog the polyp tissue was removed during nasal flushing. Three dogs have no clinical signs of nasal disease. One dog had confirmed recurrence of nasal polyps and was successfully treated with megavoltage radiation. One dog had recurrent nasal disease eight months after dorsal rhinotomy. Nasal polyps are a possible cause of nasal disease in dogs with nasal discharge, epistaxsis and stertor, and a differential diagnosis for dogs with extensive soft tissue lesions of the nasal cavities on computerised tomography. Nasal polyps can be treated successfully by rhinotomy in some cases but may reoccur.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study The most prevalent type of equine dental pulpitis due to apical infection is not associated with coronal fractures or periodontal disease. The pathogenesis of this type of pulpitis is not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used to investigate equine dental disorders. However, gross, tomographic and histopathological changes in equine dental pulpitis have not been compared previously. Objectives To compare gross, CT and histological appearances of sectioned mandibular cheek teeth extracted from horses with clinical signs of pulpitis without coronal fractures or periodontal disease. To contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of equine dental pulpitis. Study design Descriptive study using diseased and healthy teeth. Methods Mandibular cheek teeth extracted from horses with clinical signs of pulpitis (cases), and from cadavers with no history of dental disease (controls), were compared using CT in the transverse plane at 1?mm intervals. Teeth were then sectioned transversely, photographed and processed for histopathological examination. Tomographs were compared with corresponding gross and histological sections. Results Cement, dentine and bone had similar ranges of attenuation (550?2000 Hounsfield Units, HU) in tomographs but could be differentiated from pulp (-400 to 500 HU) and enamel (> 2500 HU). Twelve discrete dental lesions were identified grossly, 10 of which were characterised histologically. Reactive and reparative dentinogenesis and extensive pulpar mineralisation, previously undescribed, were identified. Pulpar oedema, neutrophilic inflammation, cement and enamel defects, and reactive cemental deposition were also observed. The CT and pathological findings corresponded well where there was mineralised tissue deposited, defects in mineralised tissue, or food material in the pulpar area. Pulpar and dentinal necrosis and cement destruction, evident grossly and histologically, did not correspond to CT changes. Conclusions Computed tomography is useful for identifying deposition and defects of mineralised material but less useful for identifying inflammation and tissue destruction. The equine dentine-pulp complex responds to insult with reactive and reparative changes.

AB  - Summary Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare multi-organ recessive disease mainly characterised by pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal defects, short stature and bone marrow failure (BMF). As in many other BMF syndromes, SDS patients are predisposed to develop a number of haematopoietic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, the mechanism of cancer predisposition in SDS patients is only partially understood. In light of the emerging role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis, we assessed the ability of MSCs derived from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) to recreate a functional bone marrow niche, taking advantage of a murine heterotopic MSC transplant model. We show that the ability of semi-cartilaginous pellets (SCPs) derived from SDS-MSCs to generate complete heterotopic ossicles in vivo is severely impaired in comparison with HD-MSC-derived SCPs. Specifically, after in vitro angiogenic stimuli, SDS-MSCs showed a defective ability to form correct networks, capillary tubes and vessels and displayed a marked decrease in VEGFA expression. Altogether, these findings unveil a novel mechanism of SDS-mediated haematopoietic dysfunction based on hampered ability of SDS-MSCs to support angiogenesis. Overall, MSCs could represent a new appealing therapeutic target to treat dysfunctional haematopoiesis in paediatric SDS patients.

AB  - A 12-week-old greyhound had a two-day history of lethargy, inappetence and shifting lameness. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Haematological examination showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and large numbers of atypical mononuclear leucocytes. A diagnosis of acute B cell lymphoblastic leukaemia was made following flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the leucocytes. The owner declined further evaluation and the dog was treated symptomatically with antibiotics. After a brief improvement, the dog's condition deteriorated and it was euthanased four days after initial presentation. The case was unusual because acute lymphoid leukaemia in the dog is most frequently reported in mature animals. This is in contrast to humans, where acute leukaemia is one of the most common childhood cancers.

AB  - Objectives To describe the history, clinicopathological abnormalities, diagnostic imaging findings, lymph node cytological/histological appearance, treatment and outcome of English springer spaniels diagnosed with idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis. Materials and Methods In this retrospective UK-based multicentre study, 64 dogs were recruited from 10 referral centres, 32 first-opinion practices and three histopathology/cytology laboratories, between 2010 and 2016. Results The median age at presentation was 6 years (range: 0.17 to 11.75). Neutered females were frequently affected. Pyrexia (83.8%), peripheral lymphadenomegaly (78.4%), dermatological lesions (72.9%), lethargy (67.6%), hyporexia (54%), diarrhoea (29.7%), coughing (24.3%), epistaxis, sneezing or nasal discharge (21.6%), ocular signs (21.6%) and vomiting (16.2%) were reported in dogs for which the history and physical examination records were available. Popliteal (45.3%), superficial cervical (35.9%) and submandibular (37.5%) lymphadenomegaly were frequently reported. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed non-specific changes. When undertaken, testing for infectious diseases was negative in all cases. Lymph node cytology, histopathology or both demonstrated mixed inflammatory (27%), pyogranulomatous (24%), neutrophilic (20%) or granulomatous (11%) lymphadenitis. Treatment details were available for 38 dogs, with 34 receiving prednisolone for a median duration of 15?weeks (range: 1 to 28?weeks). A good to excellent clinical response was reported in all but one case. Ten dogs relapsed after discontinuing prednisolone. Clinical Significance Idiopathic pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy and pyrexia in English springer spaniels. The characteristics of the disease, absence of identifiable infectious aetiology and response to glucocorticoid therapy suggest an immune-mediated aetiology.

AB  - Background It is now generally accepted that the response to a particular signal, such as the surgical trauma following implant placement, is not the result of a single linear signalling pathway, but rather reflects pathway integration, which can occur at multiple levels. Although it is well documented that both SLA and SLActive surfaces are able to promote bone formation and osseointegration, it is still unclear which are the key signalling pathways involved and how surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity might affect pathway integration. Objective To combine gene and protein data from in vivo studies applying titanium hydrophobic (Sandblasting, Large-grit, Acid-etching, SLA) and hydrophilic (SLActive) surfaces to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pro-osteogenic properties of these surfaces. Methods The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG?) pathway database and the Ingenuity? Pathway Analysis (IPA?) software were applied to the genomic and proteomic data of previous in vivo studies applying SLA and SLActive surfaces, with the specific aim to focus on bone formation-related signalling pathways. While gene data were derived from a human study on osseointegration, protein data originated from a preclinical study in rabbits. Data were available for the 4, 7 and 14 days of healing periods. Results Both genomic and proteomic data showed that the osteogenesis process takes place mainly at 7 and 14 days of healing on both SLA and SLActive surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity enhances bone formation at multiple levels, by directly promoting an earlier expression of pathways involved in cell proliferation and osteoblast precursor differentiation (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT, Wnt, Notch, transforming growth factor-?), but also by positively regulating angiogenesis, bone mineralization and bone remodelling. Conclusion This study combined, for the first time, different ?omics? outputs to get new insights on the molecular mechanisms behind the influence of surface hydrophilicity on osseointegration/bone formation. Specific signalling pathways, such as Wnt, vascular endothelial growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were identified as differentially modulated by titanium surface hydrophilicity both at a genomic and proteomic level. These findings may be used in the future to monitor/predict the bone formation/osseointegration process, or as a screening tool towards the manufacture of new pro-osteogenic implant surfaces. In order to take into account the full complexity and interplay of cell signalling during bone formation, powerful bioinformatics tools integrating different ?omics? data and predicting signalling pathways trends should be applied by future studies.

AB  - Abstract Magnesium alloys hold great promise for developing orthopedic implants that are biocompatible, biodegradable, and mechanically similar to bone tissue. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial properties of magnesium?9%aluminum?1%zinc (AZ91) and commercially pure titanium (cpTi) against Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab307). The in vitro results showed that as compared to cpTi, incubation with AZ91 significantly reduced both the planktonic (cpTi?=?3.45e8, AZ91?=?8.97e7, p?<?0.001) colony forming units (CFU) and biofilm-associated (cpTi?=?3.89e8, AZ91?=?1.78e7, p?=?0.01) CFU of Ab307. However, in vivo results showed no significant differences in the CFU enumerated from the cpTi and AZ91 implants following a 1-week implantation in an established rodent model of Ab307 implant associated infection (cpTi?=?5.23e3, AZ91?=?2.46e3, p?=?0.29). It is proposed that the in vitro results were associated with an increased pH in the bacterial culture as a result of the AZ91 corrosion process. The robust in vivo buffering capacity likely diminished this corrosion associated pH antimicrobial effect. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the known prominent role of polyunsaturated (phospho)lipids as structural blocks of biomembranes, there is an emerging understanding of another important function of these molecules as a highly diversified signaling language utilized for intra- and extracellular communications. Technological developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of a new branch of metabolomics, redox lipidomics. Analysis of lipid peroxidation reactions has already identified specific enzymatic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of several unique signals in response to inflammation and regulated cell death programs. Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities. For example, suppression of the production of AA-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, HXA3 and LTB4, by an iPLA2? inhibitor, R-BEL, mitigated injury associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes in animals exposed to whole-body irradiation. Further, technological developments promise to make redox lipidomics a powerful approach in the arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for personalized medicine of inflammatory diseases and conditions.

AB  - Abstract Circulating histones are a newly recognized mediator implicated in various inflammatory diseases. It is likely that the release of histones, from dying hepatocytes or inflammatory leukocytes, into the circulation initiates and amplifies inflammation during the course of acute liver failure (ALF). In this study, we investigated a putative pathogenic role of circulating histones in a murine model of ALF induced by D-galactosamine (GalN) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hepatic function and histological indexes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, hepatocyte apoptosis and the levels of circulating histone were measured in GalN/LPS-treated mice. GalN/LPS caused severe liver damage and a notable increase in plasma concentration of circulating histones. To further assess the role of circulating histones in our model, we administered exogenous histones and anti-histone H4 antibody. Notably, exogenous histones aggravated GalN/LPS-induced hepatotoxicity, whereas anti-histone antibody significantly protected mice. Circulating histones may serve as both a functional marker of ALF activity and as an inflammatory mediator contributing to the progression of ALF. Blockade of circulating histones shows potent protective effects, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for ALF. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 2384?2391, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To explore the informational needs of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). Methods Three focus groups and eight one-to-one interviews were conducted with patients with AAV. A purposeful sample of 15 patients (ten female) [disease: three Churg?Strauss syndrome (CSS); nine granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA); one microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); two polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)] participated in the focus groups. Eight (five female) (disease: three CSS; four GPA; one MPA) participated in the one-to-one interviews. A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore patients? experiences of informational needs. The focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and analysed using the framework technique. Results Emergent themes were: reaction to diagnosis, need for information on disease management and access to knowledgeable practitioners. When given the initial diagnosis, all patients described themselves as being too ill to take in information and that they later found it difficult to find information. Most information received at diagnosis was in the form of verbal information given by the hospital doctor. Patients wanted positive but truthful information in the form of a booklet. Conclusions Receiving the diagnosis of a rare, potentially life-threatening disease and then dealing with its complex treatment causes anxiety and fear and can impede information retention and recall. Patients want information on diagnosis and treatment but this should be tailored to individual needs, including timing that is appropriate for them. All patients wanted the opportunity to discuss their illness and its management with a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner but also wanted printed forms of information to assimilate at their own pace.

AB  - The effects of complement activation on pulmonary vascular permeability are disputed. In rabbit lungs perfused with autologous blood, zymosan activated plasma (ZAP) induced a moderate increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), but did not detectably change the vascular permeability within 2 h. The stronger neutrophil granulocyte (PMN) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), usually gave larger PVR increases and also increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Lungs from neutropenic animals, similarly perfused and given PMA, showed unchanged PVR reactions but had no apparent increase in vascular permeability. Lungs perfused with cell-free medium and given PMA displayed modest PVR increases, and no measurable permeability change. The lung preparatory procedure itself markedly influenced leukocyte circulation. Exsanguination of lung donors decreased the concentration of circulating PMN significantly, and they virtually disappeared from the perfusate within minutes after start of lung perfusion. PMN-mediated effects must therefore have been caused by cells already sequestered in the lungs. We conclude that ZAP docs not induce an increased pulmonary vascular permeability in isolated, perfused rabbit lungs, in contrast to PMA. The permeability effects of PMA appear to be PMN dependent.
