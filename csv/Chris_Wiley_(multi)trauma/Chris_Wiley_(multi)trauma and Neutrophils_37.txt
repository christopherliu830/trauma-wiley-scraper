AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the known prominent role of polyunsaturated (phospho)lipids as structural blocks of biomembranes, there is an emerging understanding of another important function of these molecules as a highly diversified signaling language utilized for intra- and extracellular communications. Technological developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of a new branch of metabolomics, redox lipidomics. Analysis of lipid peroxidation reactions has already identified specific enzymatic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of several unique signals in response to inflammation and regulated cell death programs. Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities. For example, suppression of the production of AA-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, HXA3 and LTB4, by an iPLA2? inhibitor, R-BEL, mitigated injury associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes in animals exposed to whole-body irradiation. Further, technological developments promise to make redox lipidomics a powerful approach in the arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for personalized medicine of inflammatory diseases and conditions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium bromide (RB) would improve endotracheal intubation (EI) conditions in comparison with topical lidocaine hydrochloride (LH). Study design Randomized prospective study. Animals Forty seven healthy cats of unspecified breed, aged 17 ± 11 months and weighing 2.8 ± 0.8 kg, undergoing elective procedures. Methods Anesthesia was induced with xylazine (XZ) (1.1 mg kg?1 IM) and tiletamine-zolazepam (XTZ) (7 mg kg?1 IM) and EI was attempted. Cats which could not be intubated at the first attempt (n = 34), were randomly medicated with either 0.1 mL LH 10% spray on the laryngeal mucosa (n = 17) or 0.6 mg kg?1 intravenous RB (n = 17). Sixty seconds later, a second attempt at EI was performed. The effect of both drugs was assessed using a previously published scale (Sandor Agoston). EI conditions associated with laryngoscopy, vocal cord position and movement, cough, patient movement, time and attempts needed in order to perform EI were recorded. Heart rate and end-expired CO2 concentration were monitored. Results Groups were comparable in age, weight, gender and hematological parameters. Clinically acceptable EI conditions were not significantly different between RB and LH assisted groups (p = 0.31). However, there was a significant difference in cough, vocal cord movement and position between the RB and the LH groups. The group intubated at the first attempt and receiving neither RB nor LH coughed persistently (11/13). The cats receiving RB had to be ventilated for 10?28 minutes. Conclusions and clinical relevance The present study shows that, when used in cats anesthetized with XTZ, RB paralyzes the internal laryngeal muscles keeping the vocal cords in an intermediate position (paramedial) 60 seconds after being administered. RB is an effective alternative to LH to overcome the airway protective reflexes when performing EI but requires ventilatory support until the paralysis wears off.

AB  - Objective To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of a cremophor-free formulation of paclitaxel (Paccal Vet, Oasmia Pharmaceuticals) in dogs with mast cell tumours. Methods Paccal Vet was administered at a median dose of 145 (range, 135 to 150) mg/m2intravenously once every 21 days for three cycles to 29 dogs with macroscopic grade 2 or 3 mast cell tumour. Efficacy was assessed by tumour response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0) and performance status score. Progression-free survival, quality of life and safety/adverse events were also evaluated. Clinical safety was assessed by clinicopathological analyses and recording of adverse events. Results Complete or partial response was observed in 59% of dogs. Performance status score remained constant or improved for 20 dogs and decreased by one grade for 9 dogs. Median time to progression was 247 (range, 42 to 268) days. Expected, transient frequently subclinical adverse events (primarily grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 1/2 leukopenia) were observed in the majority of dogs. Nine dogs were euthanased and one dog died due to disease progression. Clinical Significance Paccal Vet appears to be a clinically safe and effective treatment for canine mast cell tumours. Further controlled confirmatory investigation is warranted.

AB  - Background Animals with chronic cough can have normal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology when small airway disease is absent. Cytology of a tracheobronchial brushing can detect inflammation in larger airways; however, evaluation of this technique has been limited in veterinary medicine. Objective To compare airway brush cytology to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis in dogs and cats with chronic cough. Animals Forty dogs and five cats undergoing bronchoscopic investigation of chronic cough. Methods Prospective study. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed followed by tracheobronchial brushing of central airways. Results of cytologic assessment of BAL fluid and brush cytology were compared for the presence or absence of inflammation and concordance of inflammatory cell type. Results Brush cytology detected central airway inflammation in 34 of 40 (85%) dogs with inflammatory BAL fluid. However, the type of inflammation reported differed in 23 of 34 dogs. In five cats with inflammation in BAL fluid, brush cytology detected inflammation in four; the type of inflammation was discordant in all cats. Conclusions and clinical relevance Brush cytology has good agreement with BAL regarding the presence of inflammation, although the type of inflammation detected with the different sampling techniques commonly varies. Brush cytology can provide supplementary information to BAL, and additional studies will provide further information on the role of tracheobronchial brush cytology in the diagnosis and management of respiratory conditions.

AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) produced by mivacurium in the cat. Mivacurium is a short acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase and is expected to have a predictable effect of short duration (Maehr et al. 1991; Gyermek et al. 1999). Thirteen cats (seven females, six males) aged 2?14?years, body mass 3.5?5.9?kg, undergoing corneal surgery were anaesthetized with propofol (3?6?mg?kg?1 IV) after pre-anesthetic medication IM with an opioid alone or in combination with acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) or medetomidine (0.01?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (13 cats) or halothane (1 cat) in oxygen (33%) and nitrous oxide (66%) with mechanical ventilation. Cats were monitored using an ECG, side-stream capnography, and a Doppler flow sensor which was positioned on the pedal artery to estimate systolic blood pressure. The peroneal nerve was stimulated with a train-of-four (TOF) and Double Burst (DBS) pattern using a peripheral nerve stimulator, to assess the degree of NMB. Mivacurium IV (0.1?mg?kg?1) was administered over 10?seconds. The TOF stimulation was applied every 12?seconds until no twitch was apparent (onset time) and continued until the TOF ratio was considered to be 1. Response to DBS stimulation was then assessed until the ratio was 1. The same procedure was followed after recovery of a DBS ratio of 1, if administration of a further dose of mivacurium (0.05?mg?kg?1) was required. Times of onset of NMB, return of the 1st and 4th twitches, TOF and DBS ratio of 1, were recorded, and descriptive analyses performed. The effects of mivacurium on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SAP) and variations in onset and recovery time of NMB between the first bolus and the subsequent doses were determined using a paired Student t-test. The HR and SAP did not change significantly after administration of mivacurium. The onset time was significantly shorter (p?<?0.0001) after administration of the second dose of mivacurium (48?±?8?seconds) compared to the initial dose (107?±?17?seconds). The time to return of the first twitch (11?minutes 12?seconds?±?3?minutes 26?seconds) and to DBS 1 (16?minutes 41?seconds?±?4?minutes 21?seconds) were longer after the first dose than after subsequent doses (8?minutes 56?seconds ±?2?minutes 2?seconds and 18?minutes 28?seconds ±?7?minutes 19?seconds, respectively). However, a second dose of mivacurium was administered in only three cats. Reversal of NMB was never required. Mivacurium is a short acting muscle relaxant in the cat, without apparent cumulative effect after repeated dosing. The time to complete recovery in 97.5% of patients after a single bolus is estimated to be 25?minutes (mean?±?2 SD).

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite recent advances in molecular biology and genetics, the development of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is still poorly understood. Elucidation of the processes occurring in the IA wall is essential for a better understanding of IA pathophysiology. We sought to analyze the current evidence from histological, molecular and genetic studies of IA. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for articles published before Mar 1, 2019 reporting on different diagnostic markers in human IA specimens. Expression of the markers in IA wall (vs healthy arterial wall) and association with the rupture status were analyzed. The quality of the included studies and the level of the evidence for the markers were incorporated into the final data assessment. Results We included 123 studies reporting on analyses of 3476 IA (median 19 IA/study) published between 1966 and 2018. Based on microscopic, biochemical, genetic and biomechanical analyses, data on 358 diagnostic targets in the IA wall were collected. We developed a scale to distribute the diagnostic markers according to their specificity for IA or healthy arterial wall, as well as for ruptured or unruptured IA. We identified different functional pathways, which might reflect the intrinsic and extrinsic processes underlying IA pathophysiology. Conclusions Multiple histological and molecular markers and the related functional pathways contributing to the development of IA might present promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. Due to small numbers of IA samples in each study, 89% of the analyzed diagnostic markers presented with the lowest level of evidence. This underlines the need for the initiation of a multi-centric prospective histological IA register for pooled data analysis.

AB  - Anemon I is a new monitoring system that can be used to evaluate autonomic nervous system reactivity in real time by showing a simple, easily interpretated quantitative index (0?200), the Anemon Index (AI) (Junke et al. 2000). This study used the AI to evaluate the quality of analgesia during sevoflurane and fentanyl anaesthesia in pigs. Six healthy pigs, weighing 24.76?±?3.40?kg, were induced to anaesthesia with 5% sevoflurane (SEVO) in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. After endotracheal intubation SEVO was given at 1 MAC (2.66%) in 3?L?minute?1 oxygen. Fentanyl was infused IV at 50?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for the first 30?minutes of anaesthesia, discontinued for 30?minutes, and then infused at 100?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for another 30?minutes. Three mechanical noxious stimuli (needle prick, pin-prick and pressure on the abdomen) were applied for 15?seconds at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. The AI, ECG, invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), SpO2 by pulse oximetry, tidal volume, Fe?sevo, Fe?CO2 and respiratory rate were recorded before induction (baseline), after induction, after intubation and extubation, and before and during noxious stimulation at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. Recovery times were recorded. Statistically significant differences were determined by anova. Spearman rank-correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between AI and hemodynamic variables. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered significant. A significant (p?<?0.01) decrease in AI was recorded after anaesthetic induction, from 82.3?±?21.1 to 52.7?±?20.3. After intubation, AI increased slightly, but not significantly, to 71.7?±?27.1. A significant (p?<?0.05) increase of AI occurred after extubation. Nociceptive stimuli did not have any measurable effect either on AI or on recorded cardiovascular variables. There was no movement, respiratory changes, or any other visible response to noxious stimulation. The AI did not change significantly with the different doses of fentanyl. Respiratory depression and apnoea were seen in all animals during the fentanyl infusion; therefore, pigs received intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl resulted in a significant (p?<?0.001) decrease in MAP. Heart rate did not change significantly. There was no correlation between AI and cardiovascular variables (HR and MAP). Endotracheal intubation caused an increase and extubation a greater significant increase in the AI. This suggests that intubation and extubation may represent stressful events during general anaesthesia, although further studies are needed to validate the use of the AI in pigs. Sevoflurane anesthetic induction may not prevent the sympathetic stimulus caused by endotracheal intubation in pigs, as indicated by the increased AI values.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Essentially, all VCA recipients have experienced episodes of rejection. At the time this chapter was written, acute rejection episodes have been observed in up to 85% of VCA recipients within the first year. Due to the infrequent application of VCA, no single group has accumulated sufficient experience to determine histologic patterns of rejection. As such, this chapters focuses on the histopathological aspects of graft rejection within the context of the early stage of VCA development. We also provide a historic perspective of the study of VCA histopathology primed by the Banff Working Group, and considerations on non-alloimmune pathology.

AB  - The aim of this project was to identify potential protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions in stored red cell concentrates. Previously, research into protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions has focussed on specific proteins, such as cytokines. In this study, a global approach was taken which involved two-dimensional electrophoresis based Proteomics, which has the potential to uncover previously unrecognised mediators or novel proteins. Red cell products with and without pre-storage leukoreduction (each n?=?6) were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. Supernatant samples were taken at several time points until product expiry. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and those that accumulated in the supernatant were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. The protein profile of supernatant from leukoreduced red cell products was less complex compared to non-leukoreduced products (from 4.4 fold fewer proteins at day 1 to 1.6 fold fewer at day 43). Several proteins were observed to be predominantly present in leukoreduced products which may potentially be beneficial to red cell survival. These proteins were identified as being involved in the maintenance of a stable extracellular environment. Conversely, a number of proteins, which may have detrimental effects, were predominantly expressed in non-leukoreduced products. These proteins included a neutrophil chemoattractant (activator) and a potential acute-phase reactant. A number of proteins identified by mass spectrometry were matched to theoretical proteins of unknown function. The findings confirm the usefulness of Proteomics to investigate storage effects on blood products. The clinical relevance of these proteins is the focus of our future investigations.

AB  - Near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS; Jöbsis 1977) has been used in humans to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rsO2), decreases of which can be indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). This study investigated changes in rsO2, the redox status of cytochrome a/a3, and the cerebral total hemoglobin content using NIRS during different sedative and anaesthetic techniques in dogs. Eighty four foxhounds and 32 beagles aged 12.9?±?13.4 (6.3?94.4) (±SD (range)) months and weighing 24.8?±?6.6 (2.7?43) kg were divided randomly into four groups. Group AM received 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-methadone/fenpipramid (l-Polamivet) IV, group DM 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV, and group MM 40?µg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV. Group P was anaesthetized (7?mg?kg?1) and maintained (0.3?mg?kg?1?minute?1) with propofol. Thirty minutes after sedation groups AM, DM and MM received 8?µg?kg?1 naloxone IV, and at 35?minutes group MM received 200?µg?kg?1 atipamezole IV. NRIS was monitored continuously (recording interval, 1?second). Blood gases were analysed before and every 5?minutes after sedation or induction, and at 2 and 7?minutes post-naloxone injection or end of propofol infusion. Descriptive and comparative statistics (global: Kruskal?Wallis test, level of significance α?=?0.05, group comparison: Mann?Whitney test, α?=?0.0083), and Spearman's correlation were determined using the statistical software SPSS. Before drug administration rsO2 was 65?±?7% (n?=?109). One minute after drug administration significant differences between groups were found (Table 1). There was a significant increase of about 8% in rsO2 over time in the p group, whereas groups AM, DM and MM showed a significant decrease with the greatest reduction of 20% in group MM. One minute after naloxone IV pre-induction values were rapidly attained in groups AM (65.2?±?6%, n?=?31) and DM (65.4?±?5.4%, n?=?24) while in group MM (52.1?±?10.8%, n?=?27) pre-induction values of rsO2 were not reached until 1?minute after atipamezole IV (62.9?±?7.4%). Periodic breathing (MM) was mirrored by variations of rsO2. There were no significant changes or intergroup differences in the redox state of cytochrome a/a3 or of total cerebral hemoglobin content indicating cerebral blood volume (Wyatt et al. 1990). The 20% decrease in rsO2 in group MM is in the range regarded as indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply in humans (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). The effects of naloxone and atipamezole and the correlation with blood gas analysis demonstrate an influence of respiratory depression on the vascular cerebral O2 status whereas the lack of cytochrome a/a3 reduction indicates an undisturbed cellular O2 supply (Jöbsis 1977). In spite of some limitations in terms of applicability (Alef 2002). NIRS seems to enable the influence of clinical routines on cerebral oxygenation to be monitored although further validation of NIRS in the dog and the cat is required.

AB  - An economical anaesthetic technique of short duration that can be administered to piglets in the field is desirable for humanitarian reasons, for castration, tail docking or other brief procedures. Using the principles of anaesthetic uptake and distribution, an inhaler was developed to vaporize and administer isoflurane to piglets. The inhaler design consisted of a mask, vaporization chamber and a rebreathing bag. A stopcock provided access for injection of liquid isoflurane onto a wick contained in the vaporization chamber. Inspiratory and expiratory flow of air over the wick enhanced anaesthetic vaporization. The amount of liquid isoflurane required for induction and 2?3?minutes of surgical anaesthesia was calculated using the square root of time model proposed by Lowe & Ernst (1981) for liquid injection, closed circuit anaesthesia in people. Calculations were based on an assumed MAC of 1.4% and the achievement of a target alveolar concentration of 1.3 MAC to provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. The appropriate isoflurane concentrations in the mask, inhaler, rebreathing bag and the piglet's FRC and tissues were calculated. Original calculations were based on metabolic size (BW0.75) and then converted to weight (kg). Based on the piglet's scale weight, the total microliters of liquid isoflurane required were formulated into a table for field use. Isoflurane was injected into the inhaler stopcock followed by oxygen to fill the rebreathing bag and initiate vaporization. After the mask was placed over the piglet's nose a slide switch was activated to allow gases to move in and out of the inhaler and rebreathing bag. Fifty-seven male piglets weighing (mean?±?SD 3.0?±?0.7?kg) and aged 7.7?±?1.0?days were randomly selected to receive anaesthesia prior to castration. Remaining littermates served as controls for assessing morbidity or mortality. The time to induction, recovery and total anaesthetic time were measured. The Pe?CO2 was measured at the piglet's nostril immediately after the mask was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Data were analysed in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure. Inductions were rapid, 47?±?9?seconds, generally with minimal or no resistance. The duration of surgery was 1?2?minutes. Anaesthesia was adequate and recovery was rapid, 122?±?44?seconds. Total time from start to standing was 260?±?51?seconds. The Pe?CO2 was 5.2?±?1.1?kPa (39.4?±?8.4?mm?Hg). There was no morbidity or mortality associated with either group of piglets. After piglets were standing and mobile, they were returned to the sow and other littermates, where they immediately started nursing and were indistinguishable from littermates except by determination of ear notch number. This technique provides safe, rapid anaesthesia and recovery that is appropriate for use by veterinarians for brief field procedures.

AB  - A central eyeball position is often required during sedation or anaesthesia to facilitate examination of the eye. However, use of neuromuscular blockade to produce a central eye position may result in depressed ventilation. This study evaluated the eyeball position, muscle relaxation and changes in ventilation during general anaesthesia after the IV administration of 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium. With client consent, 12 dogs of different breeds, body mass 27.2?±?11.8?kg, aged 5.6?±?2.8?years (mean?±?SD) were anaesthetized for ocular examination. Pre-anaesthetic medication was 0.01?mg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.2?mg?kg?1 butorphanol IV. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect and maintained with 10?mg?kg?1?hour?1 propofol by infusion. The dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency, their trachea intubated and connected to a circle breathing system (FiO2?=?1.0). All dogs breathed spontaneously. The superficial peroneal nerve of the right hind leg was stimulated every 15?seconds with a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation pattern and neuromuscular function was assessed with an acceleromyograph (TOF-Guard). Adequacy of ventilation was measured with the Ventrak 1550. After 10?minutes of anaesthesia to allow stabilisation of baseline values, 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium was administered IV. Minute volume (Vm), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), Pe?CO2 and maximal depression of T1 and TOF ratio were measured. Data were analysed using a paired t-test. The changes in the eyeball position were recorded. A total of 100?±?33?seconds after the injection of rocuronium, T1 was maximally depressed to 62?±?21% and the TOF ratio to 42?±?18% of baseline values. Both variables returned to baseline after 366?±?132?seconds (T1) and 478?±?111?seconds (TOF). There was no significant reduction in Vm (2.32?±?1.1?L?minute?1), Vt (124.1?±?69.3?mL) and RR (10?±?3.8?breaths?minute?1) and no increase in Pe?CO2 (6.5?±?2.1?kPa (48.8?±?16.1?mm?Hg)) throughout the procedure. The eyeball rotated to a central position 35?±?7?seconds after rocuronium IV and remained there for a minimum of 20?±?7?minutes in all dogs. We conclude that rocuronium at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1 can be administered to dogs IV with minimal changes in ventilatory variables. The eyeball is fixed in a central position for at least 20?minutes, which greatly facilitates clinical examination.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee. Owner informed consent was obtained before sampling. Sources of funding:?The Equine Grass Sickness Fund and The University of Reading. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Elise Pilkington Charitable Trust, Dr Wilfrid Bechtolsheimer, British Dressage.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.
