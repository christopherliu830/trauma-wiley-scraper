AB  - Reasons for performing study Diffusion of local anaesthetic solution after a mid-pastern ring block has not been investigated. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following injection of radiodense contrast medium as performed for a mid-pastern ring block. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. One and a half ml radiodense contrast medium was injected over the medial or lateral palmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages. A dorsal ring block was performed on the ipsilateral side, 1.5?cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx, using 2 or 5?ml contrast medium. Both forelimbs were injected on 2 days (48 injections). Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately, 10 and 20?min after injections. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After dorsal injections the contrast medium was distributed in a diffuse patch over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx (PP), extending proximally over the half of the length of PP in all limbs (greatest proximal extension: 89.0% of the length of PP [from distal] after 2?ml, 94.2% after 5?ml). There was significant proximal diffusion in the first 10?min after injection and significant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P<0.01). There was significant positive association between injected volume and the proximal extension of the dorsal contrast patch (P?=?0.01). The median dorsal diffusion was to the dorsal midline of PP; 5?ml contrast medium resulted in significantly greater dorsal diffusion than 2?ml (P<0.01). The dorsal and the palmar contrast patches did not merge. Conclusions Diffusion to the proximal aspect of P1 occurred even after injection of only 2?ml contrast medium. Fetlock region pain may be influenced by a mid-pastern ring block. Ethical animal research:?Written consent had been obtained from a representative of the horses' owner prior to starting the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The measurement of immunoglobulins is important in foals, as individuals with evidence of failure of passive transfer are at increased risk of infection and death during the first month of life. Objectives To identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal's IgG concentration as applied in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalised foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. Study design Prospective study including 46 foals <7 days old, divided into 4 groups based on age and health status. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated manually. Significance was set at P<0.05. Methods Several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: serum and plasma total protein, albumin and protein spectrum including gamma globulin concentration (GGC) measured by chemistry analyser, total protein by refractometer, glutaraldehyde coagulation test and a semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay (SNAP). IBM SPSS Statistics 20A was used. A one-way ANOVA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining significant differences among tests and between groups. Correlations between the turbidimetric immunoassay and the screening tests were calculated using linear regression with a 95% CI. Results Group differences were not found. The most accurate alternative test was the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyser (R 0.83) and GGC (R 0.84) with sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 100% and 95 and 93% respectively. A total serum protein of ≥49?g/l and a GGC of ≥6?g/l corresponded with an IgG concentration of ≥8?g/l. Conclusions According to this study, the most reliable alternative test suitable in a clinical setting for the determination of IgG concentration was measuring total serum protein by a chemistry analyser in combination with serum GGC.

AB  - Reasons for performing study When managing strangles in horses, it is crucial to detect chronic infection with Streptococcus equi (SE), i.e. silent carriers. Objectives Evaluate diagnostics for SE carriers over time in a farm. Study design Longitudinal observational study. Methods Sixty-three Icelandic horses isolated on an island were studied 4 to 26 months after remission of acute strangles, including repeated clinical examination and collection of blood, nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL), and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples. Twenty-two horses were treated with penicillin locally and systemically. Serology for S.?equi was examined by iELISA [1]. Nasopharyngeal lavage and GPL samples were investigated for S.?equi and S.?zooepidemicus by real-time PCR [2]. Results Thirty-three per cent were SE carriers after 15 months, despite repeated penicillin treatment. In 16/18 carriers, GPL samples were PCR-positive, but not NPL samples, whereas the opposite was true in 2 horses. Several carriers with persistent aerocystitis were not detected by 3 consecutive NPL samples. Five of 18 carriers were seronegative (27.8%) at 15 months. Following conservative treatment, 7 of these 18 carriers were still carriers at 20 months, 8 were negative, and 3 were lost for sampling. Only GPL samples were positive at this point, and only 1/7 carriers were seropositive. Conclusions To detect chronic carriers of strangles, RT-PCR analysis from both GPL and NPL samples may be necessary. Serological screening at individual level often misses individual carriers in long-term cases. Ethical animal research:?The testing was approved by the Swedish Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments and horse owners gave their informed consent for inclusion of animals in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary treatment for their working equids in Morocco. There is no information available regarding cultural, religious or educational barriers to obtaining treatment or about the typical workload of these animals which may predispose them to colic. Objectives To characterise the typical workload and feeding regimens of working equids in Morocco; to characterise the ability of owners to recognise the clinical signs and causes of colic; and to identify specific barriers to the veterinary treatment of colic. Study design Questionnaire-based survey. Methods A standardised, structured questionnaire was administered, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, to the owners of working equids presenting their animals to 2 centres run by SPANA (The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad). Participation was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Results All of the 102 participants that completed questionnaire were male. Ninety-eight owners used their animals for pulling carts, with 12% of animals working 7 days per week. 14% of animals were offered water by their owner once per day and 2% every other day. 25% of animals were loose and allowed free to feed unsupervised when not working. 29% of owners were not able to name any cause of colic and 25% did not recognise any clinical signs; only 12% associated colic with gastrointestinal pain. 83% of owners would not seek veterinary treatment due to financial constraints if free treatment at SPANA centres were not available. Conclusions Colic remains a common problem amongst working equids in Morocco. Improved knowledge of management factors associated with colic and how to recognise abdominal pain may reduce the incidence of colic and improve prognosis. The findings presented can be used to inform and develop owner education programmes. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all owners and was delivered in the native language. No details identifying the owner were recorded. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.

AB  - Near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS; Jöbsis 1977) has been used in humans to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rsO2), decreases of which can be indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). This study investigated changes in rsO2, the redox status of cytochrome a/a3, and the cerebral total hemoglobin content using NIRS during different sedative and anaesthetic techniques in dogs. Eighty four foxhounds and 32 beagles aged 12.9?±?13.4 (6.3?94.4) (±SD (range)) months and weighing 24.8?±?6.6 (2.7?43) kg were divided randomly into four groups. Group AM received 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-methadone/fenpipramid (l-Polamivet) IV, group DM 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV, and group MM 40?µg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV. Group P was anaesthetized (7?mg?kg?1) and maintained (0.3?mg?kg?1?minute?1) with propofol. Thirty minutes after sedation groups AM, DM and MM received 8?µg?kg?1 naloxone IV, and at 35?minutes group MM received 200?µg?kg?1 atipamezole IV. NRIS was monitored continuously (recording interval, 1?second). Blood gases were analysed before and every 5?minutes after sedation or induction, and at 2 and 7?minutes post-naloxone injection or end of propofol infusion. Descriptive and comparative statistics (global: Kruskal?Wallis test, level of significance α?=?0.05, group comparison: Mann?Whitney test, α?=?0.0083), and Spearman's correlation were determined using the statistical software SPSS. Before drug administration rsO2 was 65?±?7% (n?=?109). One minute after drug administration significant differences between groups were found (Table 1). There was a significant increase of about 8% in rsO2 over time in the p group, whereas groups AM, DM and MM showed a significant decrease with the greatest reduction of 20% in group MM. One minute after naloxone IV pre-induction values were rapidly attained in groups AM (65.2?±?6%, n?=?31) and DM (65.4?±?5.4%, n?=?24) while in group MM (52.1?±?10.8%, n?=?27) pre-induction values of rsO2 were not reached until 1?minute after atipamezole IV (62.9?±?7.4%). Periodic breathing (MM) was mirrored by variations of rsO2. There were no significant changes or intergroup differences in the redox state of cytochrome a/a3 or of total cerebral hemoglobin content indicating cerebral blood volume (Wyatt et al. 1990). The 20% decrease in rsO2 in group MM is in the range regarded as indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply in humans (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). The effects of naloxone and atipamezole and the correlation with blood gas analysis demonstrate an influence of respiratory depression on the vascular cerebral O2 status whereas the lack of cytochrome a/a3 reduction indicates an undisturbed cellular O2 supply (Jöbsis 1977). In spite of some limitations in terms of applicability (Alef 2002). NIRS seems to enable the influence of clinical routines on cerebral oxygenation to be monitored although further validation of NIRS in the dog and the cat is required.

AB  - An economical anaesthetic technique of short duration that can be administered to piglets in the field is desirable for humanitarian reasons, for castration, tail docking or other brief procedures. Using the principles of anaesthetic uptake and distribution, an inhaler was developed to vaporize and administer isoflurane to piglets. The inhaler design consisted of a mask, vaporization chamber and a rebreathing bag. A stopcock provided access for injection of liquid isoflurane onto a wick contained in the vaporization chamber. Inspiratory and expiratory flow of air over the wick enhanced anaesthetic vaporization. The amount of liquid isoflurane required for induction and 2?3?minutes of surgical anaesthesia was calculated using the square root of time model proposed by Lowe & Ernst (1981) for liquid injection, closed circuit anaesthesia in people. Calculations were based on an assumed MAC of 1.4% and the achievement of a target alveolar concentration of 1.3 MAC to provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. The appropriate isoflurane concentrations in the mask, inhaler, rebreathing bag and the piglet's FRC and tissues were calculated. Original calculations were based on metabolic size (BW0.75) and then converted to weight (kg). Based on the piglet's scale weight, the total microliters of liquid isoflurane required were formulated into a table for field use. Isoflurane was injected into the inhaler stopcock followed by oxygen to fill the rebreathing bag and initiate vaporization. After the mask was placed over the piglet's nose a slide switch was activated to allow gases to move in and out of the inhaler and rebreathing bag. Fifty-seven male piglets weighing (mean?±?SD 3.0?±?0.7?kg) and aged 7.7?±?1.0?days were randomly selected to receive anaesthesia prior to castration. Remaining littermates served as controls for assessing morbidity or mortality. The time to induction, recovery and total anaesthetic time were measured. The Pe?CO2 was measured at the piglet's nostril immediately after the mask was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Data were analysed in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure. Inductions were rapid, 47?±?9?seconds, generally with minimal or no resistance. The duration of surgery was 1?2?minutes. Anaesthesia was adequate and recovery was rapid, 122?±?44?seconds. Total time from start to standing was 260?±?51?seconds. The Pe?CO2 was 5.2?±?1.1?kPa (39.4?±?8.4?mm?Hg). There was no morbidity or mortality associated with either group of piglets. After piglets were standing and mobile, they were returned to the sow and other littermates, where they immediately started nursing and were indistinguishable from littermates except by determination of ear notch number. This technique provides safe, rapid anaesthesia and recovery that is appropriate for use by veterinarians for brief field procedures.

AB  - A central eyeball position is often required during sedation or anaesthesia to facilitate examination of the eye. However, use of neuromuscular blockade to produce a central eye position may result in depressed ventilation. This study evaluated the eyeball position, muscle relaxation and changes in ventilation during general anaesthesia after the IV administration of 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium. With client consent, 12 dogs of different breeds, body mass 27.2?±?11.8?kg, aged 5.6?±?2.8?years (mean?±?SD) were anaesthetized for ocular examination. Pre-anaesthetic medication was 0.01?mg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.2?mg?kg?1 butorphanol IV. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect and maintained with 10?mg?kg?1?hour?1 propofol by infusion. The dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency, their trachea intubated and connected to a circle breathing system (FiO2?=?1.0). All dogs breathed spontaneously. The superficial peroneal nerve of the right hind leg was stimulated every 15?seconds with a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation pattern and neuromuscular function was assessed with an acceleromyograph (TOF-Guard). Adequacy of ventilation was measured with the Ventrak 1550. After 10?minutes of anaesthesia to allow stabilisation of baseline values, 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium was administered IV. Minute volume (Vm), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), Pe?CO2 and maximal depression of T1 and TOF ratio were measured. Data were analysed using a paired t-test. The changes in the eyeball position were recorded. A total of 100?±?33?seconds after the injection of rocuronium, T1 was maximally depressed to 62?±?21% and the TOF ratio to 42?±?18% of baseline values. Both variables returned to baseline after 366?±?132?seconds (T1) and 478?±?111?seconds (TOF). There was no significant reduction in Vm (2.32?±?1.1?L?minute?1), Vt (124.1?±?69.3?mL) and RR (10?±?3.8?breaths?minute?1) and no increase in Pe?CO2 (6.5?±?2.1?kPa (48.8?±?16.1?mm?Hg)) throughout the procedure. The eyeball rotated to a central position 35?±?7?seconds after rocuronium IV and remained there for a minimum of 20?±?7?minutes in all dogs. We conclude that rocuronium at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1 can be administered to dogs IV with minimal changes in ventilatory variables. The eyeball is fixed in a central position for at least 20?minutes, which greatly facilitates clinical examination.

AB  - Alpha2 agonists have a significant role in epidural anaesthetic techniques. However, there are few reports regarding epidural administration of these drugs especially in small animals (Greene et al. 1995; Keegan et al. 1995; Vesal et al. 1996). This study compared the haemodynamic effects of xylazine and medetomidine after epidural injection in dogs. Six dogs (four females and two males) weighing 27.5?±?3.39?kg, aged 5.6?±?1.42?years were studied on two separate occasions one month apart. Dogs were sedated with 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam IM and 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM. After 20?minutes, a lumbosacral epidural injection of 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine was administered (group X). One month later, following the same sedation, 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine was administered epidurally (group M). Haemodynamic variables (ECG and indirect blood pressure (Doppler)), respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded before (baseline) and then every 5?minutes after the epidural injection, up to 60?minutes. Differences between groups were compared by a paired t-test. Within group changes were compared to basal values by anova. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both groups showed significant reductions in heart rate (106.3?±?7.7 beats?minute?1 baseline versus 67.7?±?7.6 (group M); 91?±?3.8 baseline versus 52.3?±?9 (group X)) and mean arterial blood pressure (113.1?±?12.3?mm?Hg baseline versus 87?±?11 (group M); 118?±?7 baseline versus 91?±?14 (group X)). There were no differences between groups in these variables. After epidural injection, first degree atrioventricular block was recorded significantly more often in group X (50% against 33%) but second degree block was significantly more frequent in group M (66% against 33%). Also 50% of dogs in group X and 66% in group M showed sinus arrest. Respiratory rate decreased significantly in both groups following the epidural injection (20.66?±?0.66?minute?1 baseline versus 16.33?±?4.77 (group M); 37.66?±?0.56 baseline versus 16.33?±?1.81 group X), but no differences between groups were observed. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in group X (38.16?±?0.21) with respect to the basal measurement (39.30?±?0.14?°C). In group M, there was no significant reduction in temperature, however, no statistical difference in rectal temperature was found between groups. This study shows that 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine and 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine produce similar, significant cardiovascular and respiratory changes following lumbosacral epidural administration in dogs.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare two methods of measuring physiological dead space/tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) and alveolar dead space (VdALV). Measurements were obtained by automated single breath CO2 analysis (Ventrak 1550/Capnoguard 1265 (V VdALV: 56.1?64.3?mL) did not differ significantly from those calculated arithmetically (Vd/Vt: 0.62?0.63; VdALV: 54.09?66.31?mL). The mean differences and standard deviation in Vd/Vt was 0.63?±?0.00 and in VdALV 58.98?±?4.28?mL for the two measurement techniques. Our data indicate that V&C can be used for accurate noninvasive online Vd/Vt and VdALV measurements in anaesthetized ventilated dogs.

AB  - Summary In the mid-1950s, the need of mass cultivation techniques for vaccine production led to the development of large-scale cell culture bioreactors. The rapid growth in biopharmaceutical industry, with a surge of protein, antibody, and peptide drugs expected in the next 10-20 years, has been led by various products produced by mammalian cells. Mammalian cells can be grown as suspension cells or as anchorage-dependent cells. A deep understanding of cell metabolism is crucial for designing feeding strategies to improve productivity and decrease culture costs. The metabolic pathways of glutamine and glucose have been reported to be quite similar to all mammalian cells including stem cells. Static culture systems such as multi well-plates, T-flasks, or tissue culture Petri dishes are the most widely used options for expanding mammalian cells. Two case studies focusing mammalian cell culture for antibody production and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, in bioreactors systems, are presented.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. Low molecular weight metabolites represent the end product of the cell regulatory processes. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease specific metabolites that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and be used in its early diagnosis. Objectives We hypothesise that there are different metabolomic profiles that can be identified in early OA SF and some of these metabolites are potential biomarkers. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Synovial fluid was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. SF was analysed with Proton (1H)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 600?MHz Avance III equipped with a cryoprobe and chilled sample-jet autosampler. The software we use is Topsin 3.1 and IconNMR 4.6.7. The following methods were used in order to identify changes in lipids and small molecules; 1D Nuclear Overhauser Effect, Longitudinal Encode-decode and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill. Data analysis was undertaken using unsupervised statistical methods and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results The results demonstrated clustering on principle component analysis between normal and OA samples. Seven metabolites were identified as significantly different in OA P<0.05; mobile lipid 1, methyl group, 2 lactates, proline and 2 citrates. Furthermore total lipid load correlated very closely to Mankin's scoring. Using IPA we identified metabolic pathways relating to altered glycolysis in early OA. Conclusions We identified the metabolic fingerprint of early OA which may allow for better phenotyping of disease states and thereby facilitate targeting of improved treatment regimes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Although fasciolosis is an important livestock disease worldwide, the public health importance of human fasciolosis has increased in recent years and it is recognised as an important re-emerging zoonotic disease, its epidemiology and pathogenicity in donkeys, and the epidemiological role they may play have not been determined. Objectives To investigate the epidemiology and pathogenicity of fasciolosis in donkeys. Study design Cross-sectional coprological and retrospective post-mortem study. Methods Faecal samples collected from 803 randomly selected working donkeys from the central region of Ethiopia were analysed by a sedimentation-centrifugation-flotation technique. Further data on liver-flukes and associated pathologies were obtained by routine post mortem examinations of 112 donkeys, subjected to euthanasia on welfare grounds or died. Data were analysed using a generalised linear model and multivariate binary logistic regression in R statistical package with significance level of statistical tests set at P<0.05. Results Infection prevalences of 44.4% and 41.9% were obtained in coprologically and post mortem examined donkeys, respectively, irrespective of their age. Both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica were identified with the mean infection intensity of 30 flukes. Older donkeys (≥8 years) were found harbouring a significantly higher worm burden (P<0.0001). Gross and histopathologies of hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts, fibrosis of large portal areas and irregular bile duct proliferation and hypertrophy were noted. Conclusions The high infection prevalence of fasciolosis and the associated hepatic pathologies in working donkeys shows not only the susceptibility of donkeys and the impact it has on their health, but also indicates the important role they can play in the epidemiology of both livestock and human fasciolosis. These further demonstrate the need for these animals to be considered in the overall epidemiological studies and for sound control strategies and prevention of fasciolosis.
