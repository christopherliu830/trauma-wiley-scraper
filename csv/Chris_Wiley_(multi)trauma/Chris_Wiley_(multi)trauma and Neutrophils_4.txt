AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - Summary As more patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving, despite severe immune suppression, clinicians are faced with atypical manifestations of both common and uncommon dermatoses. A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45 cells/?L. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Aims To examine the efficacy of using fibrin glue (FG) as an interpositioning layer in the repair of complicated vesioovaginal fistulae (VVFe) as compared to the classical repair using martius flaps (Ml?). Methods The study was conducted in 3 African institutions. Forty female patients with complicated VVFs were randomized into 2 groups. Group A were repaired anatomically using PG as interpositioning layer. Group B were repaired anatomically using MF as an interpositioning layer. FG used in this study was prepared from patients own blood. Complicating factors were recurrence, local moderate lo severe fibrosis, fistula location involving the bladder neck, and or size of the fistola being more than 1.5 cm in its largest diameter. Patients were evaluated after 2 weeks, one month and 3 months postoperatively. Results Thirty eight patients were evaluable as 2 patients, one from each group, lost to follow-up. Patient demographics were not different between the two study groups. The frequency of occurrence of complicating factors was not different between the 2 groups. Thirteen of group A and eleven from group B were rendered dry and that was maintained for as long as they were followed-up. The difference in the outcome was not statistically significant. Conclusion The use of FG as an interpositioning layer during the vaginal anatomical repair of complicated VVF appears to be of great value as an alternative to the use of MF interpositioning. Decreasing the operative time and adding simplicity to the already complicated procedure are additional values of using this procedure. Neurourol. Urodynam. 28:438?441, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Neutrophil influx is essential for corneal regeneration (Gan et al. 1999). KM+, a lectin from Artocarpus integrifolia, induces neutrophil migration (Santos-de-Oliveira et al. 1994). This study aims at investigating a possible effect of KM+ on corneal regeneration in rabbits. A 6.0-mm diameter area of debridement was created on the cornea of both eyes by mechanical scraping. The experimental eyes received drops of KM+ (2.5??g/ml) every 2?h. The control eyes received buffer. The epithelial wounded areas of the lectin-treated and untreated eyes were stained with fluorescein, photographed and measured. The animals were killed 12?h (group 1, n?=?5), 24?h (group 2, n?=?10) and 48?h (group 3, n?=?5) after the scraping. The corneas were analysed histologically (haematoxylin and eosin and immunostaining for proliferation cell nuclear antigen, p63, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-Met and laminin). No significant differences were found at the epithelial gap between treated and control eyes in the group 1. However, the number of neutrophils in the wounded area was significantly higher in treated eyes in this group. Three control and seven treated eyes were healed completely and only rare neutrophils persisted in the corneal stroma in group 2. No morphological distinction was observed between treated and control eyes in group 3. In treated corneas of group 2, there was an increase in immunostaining of factors involved in corneal healing compared to controls. Thus, topical application of KM+ may facilitate corneal epithelial wound healing in rabbits by means of a mechanism that involves increased influx of neutrophils into the wounded area induced by the lectin.

AB  - Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is of obvious relevance in situations where there is an interruption of blood supply to the gut, as in vascular surgery, or in the construction of free intestinal grafts. It is now appreciated that IRI also underlies the gut dysfunction that occurs in early shock, sepsis, and trauma. The events that occur during IRI are complex. However, recent advances in cellular biology have started to unravel these underlying processes. The aim of this review is to provide an outline of current knowledge on the mechanisms and consequences of IRI. Initially, IRI appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites and, at a later stage, by the priming and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury can diminish the barrier function of the gut, and can promote an increase in the leakage of molecules (intestinal permeability) or the passage of microbes across the wall of the bowel (bacterial trans-location). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the gut can result in the generation of molecules that may also harm distant tissues.

AB  - Abstract The mechanism by which trauma initiates healing remains unclear. Precise understanding of these events may define interventions for accelerating healing that could be translated to the clinical arena. We previously reported that addition of low-dose recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) at the fracture site augmented fracture repair in a murine tibial fracture model. Here, we show that local rhTNF treatment is only effective when administered within 24 h of injury, when neutrophils are the major inflammatory cell infiltrate. Systemic administration of anti-TNF impaired fracture healing. Addition of rhTNF enhanced neutrophil recruitment and promoted recruitment of monocytes through CCL2 production. Conversely, depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in significantly impaired fracture healing. Fragility, or osteoporotic, fractures represent a major medical problem as they are associated with permanent disability and premature death. Using a murine model of fragility fractures, we found that local rhTNF treatment improved fracture healing during the early phase of repair. If translated clinically, this promotion of fracture healing would reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed patient mobilization.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Accumulations of mucus within the trachea are often found during endoscopic examinations of the airways of poorly performing racehorses, but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of tracheal mucus, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) and cytological indices of tracheal aspirate on racing performance in Thoroughbred horses assessed by race place and whether the horse was raced. Methods: Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea was performed, and a tracheal aspirate obtained monthly at Thistledown racetrack from April to December, 2002 and 2003. Horses received a score of 0?4 for the degree of PLH and 0?4 for the amount of mucus visible in the trachea. The tracheal aspirate was assessed for turbidity, and total and differential cell counts. Generalised estimating equations models were used as repeated measures models for each risk factor and the level of association assessed through the risk factor's P value in the model. Results: Moderate to severe tracheal mucus (2?4) was a risk factor for poor racing performance. There was no association between degree of PLH, cell counts or turbidity of tracheal wash fluid and racing performance. However, horses that raced had higher total neutrophil counts in tracheal wash aspirates than horses that did not race. Conclusions: Grades 2?4 tracheal mucus should be considered a potential cause of poor racing performance in Thoroughbred horses. Clinical relevance: Because moderate to severe tracheal mucus accumulation, and not increased tracheal neutrophils, was a risk factor for poor racing performance, functionally significant airway inflammation may best be confirmed by the presence of mucus rather than increased number of neutrophils in the trachea.

AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in both the developing and adult brain by providing structural support and mediating cell-cell interactions. In this review, we focus on the major constituents of the ECM and how they function in both normal and injured brain, and summarize the changes in the composition of the ECM as well as how these changes either promote or inhibit recovery of function following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Modulation of ECM composition to facilitates neuronal survival, regeneration and axonal outgrowth is a potential therapeutic target for TBI treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - 1 Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a cytokine with diverse properties consistent with a possible role in inflammatory disease. We investigated whether TNF-α is induced during the progression of lung inflammation elicited by a particulate non-antigenic stimulus, and whether pharmacological control of TNF-α expression influences recruitment of specific inflammatory cell types. 2 A single intravenous injection of Sephadex particles into rats led to extensive granulomatous inflammation in lung alveolar and bronchial tissue that peaked in intensity after 24?72?h. Mononuclear cells were the principal component of granulomas, but neutrophils and eosinophils were also abundant. Numbers of mononuclear cells, neutrophils and eosinophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) peaked at 72?h, 48?h and 72?h, respectively. 3 Messenger RNA encoding TNF-α was induced in lung epithelial cells, lung granulomas and BAL cells 6?h after Sephadex administration and remained elevated for 72?h before declining to baseline by 7 days. In BAL cell populations TNF-α protein was localized to mononuclear cells at all times points pre- and post-Sephadex administration. 4 Treatment of rats with dexamethasone significantly reduced the Sephadex-induced recruitment of mononuclear cells, neutrophils and eosinophils into the bronchoalveolar cavity, and significantly reduced TNF-α mRNA expression by BAL cells. 5 Treatment of rats with cyclosporin A was without effect on Sephadex-induced elevations of mononuclear cell numbers and expression of TNF-α, but did reduce significantly recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils to BAL cell populations. 6 These results show that a sequential asthma-like recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells into lung tissue can be induced by single exposure to a non-antigenic stimulus. Pharmacological and histological studies reveal that mononuclear cell mobilization relates closely to induced TNF-α expression, whereas mobilization of neutrophils and eosinophils appears secondary to expression of the cytokine.

AB  - Abstract Background Little is known about childhood ALL in the Middle East. This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East. Procedure Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions. Results The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1?±?3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6?RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable. Conclusions This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014; 61:1403?1410. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
