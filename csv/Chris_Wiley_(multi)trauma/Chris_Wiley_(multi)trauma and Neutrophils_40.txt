AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using ≤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype. Ethical animal research:?Ethical University Committee approved all the procedures and owner informed consent was obtained. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.

AB  - Acepromazine, a phenothiazine tranquilizer, causes hypotension in standing horses (Parry et al. 1982). However, a retrospective study (Taylor & Young 1993) showed that acepromazine pre-anesthetic medication did not affect arterial blood pressure (MAP) in anaesthetized horses. This study examined the effects of acepromazine on MAP during romifidine?ketamine?halothane anaesthesia in horses anaesthetized for various surgical procedures. Forty-four horses were allocated by block randomization to groups A and B. Group A received acepromazine 0.05?mg?kg?1 IM 30?minutes before induction of anaesthesia, group B did not. All horses received romifidine 0.1?mg?kg?1 IV 5?minutes before anaesthesia was induced with diazepam 0.05?mg?kg?1 and 2.2?mg?kg?1 ketamine IV. The horses' trachea were intubated and horses breathed 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide plus halothane (concentration adjusted as required clinically) from a circle breathing system. Nitrous oxide was discontinued after 10?minutes and analgesics, flunixin 1.1?mg?kg?1 and either morphine 0.1?mg?kg?1 or butorphanol 0.05?mg?kg?1 (matched for horses undergoing the same procedure) administered IV. The facial or dorsal metatarsal artery was catheterized for direct measurement of MAP (every 10?min) and withdrawal of blood for gas analysis (every 30?min). The electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored continuously with a 10?seconds printout obtained every 10?minutes. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was instigated if PaCO2 exceeded 9.3?kPa (70?mm?Hg). Dobutamine was infused (1.0?5.0?kg?1minute?1) if MAP?<?58?mm?Hg and was continued until MAP?>?70?mm?Hg. Mean age, weight and duration of anaesthesia were compared between the groups using a t-test for independent samples. Gender distribution and numbers of horses requiring IPPV or dobutamine were compared between groups using a chi-squared test (with Yates correction). To compare MAP over time, the area under the curve (MAPAUC) was calculated and compared between groups using a t-test. Horses receiving dobutamine were excluded from MAPAUC and MAP comparisons. The ECG printouts were examined for arrhythmias. There were no significant differences between groups (p?>?0.05). Group A contained three stallions, 10 geldings and nine mares, aged 6.3?years (range 0.75?18). Group B comprised eight stallions, 11 geldings and three mares aged 7.3(1?16)?years. Duration of anaesthesia was group A 97 (50?140)?minutes, group B 99 (50?160)?minutes. Eight horses in group A and three in group B required IPPV. Nine horses in group A and four in group B received dobutamine. Mean arterial pressure ranged from 60 to 128?mm?Hg in group A and 58?96?mm?Hg in group B. Mean MAPAUC was 5941?mm?Hg?minute?1 in group A, in B 6000?mm?Hg?minute?1. Atrial pre-mature complexes were recorded from one horse in group B. No other arrhythmias were detected. Although MAP was lower in the acepromazine group, this appeared unlikely to cause a clinical problem. The incidence of arrhythmias was too low to determine the influence of acepromazine in this study.

AB  - Studies evaluating the effects of dobutamine in horses do not consistently report increases in cardiac output despite increases in arterial blood pressure. The concurrent administration of the α2 agonist clonidine, in people, inhibited the chronotropic effects of dobutamine and increased left ventricular stroke work (Zimpfer et al. 1982). Our study was performed to determine if pre-medication with an α2 agonist affects the response to dobutamine in anaesthetized horses. Eleven horses were anaesthetized on four separate occasions for one of four randomly assigned treatments; (I) no xylazine, no dobutamine (II) xylazine, no dobutamine (III) no xylazine, dobutamine, and (IV) xylazine, dobutamine. Horses received 0.02?mg?kg?1 of butorphanol IV 10?minutes prior to anesthetic induction. Two?minutes prior to induction, groups II and IV received 0.5?mg?kg?1 of IV xylazine. Anaesthesia was induced with 6?7?mg?kg?1 of thiopental and maintained with halothane. End-tidal halothane concentrations were maintained between 1.1 and 1.2% in groups I and III, and 0.9?1.0% for groups II and IV. Heart rate, cardiac output, right atrial pressure, and systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressure were recorded 30?minutes after beginning halothane anaesthesia (T10). Cardiac output was estimated using Lithium dilution (Linton et al. 2000). Baseline measurements were repeated twice, at 5-minute intervals (T5 and T0). At time 0 (T0), an IV infusion of either saline (100?mL?hour?1) or dobutamine (0.001?mg?kg?1?minute?1) was started and data recorded at 5-minute intervals for 30?minutes (T5 ? T30). Stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were calculated. Data were analysed using repeated measures anova (p?<?0.01 significant) and Newman?Keuls for multiple comparisons. Cardiac output and stroke volume increased over time in groups III and IV. Cardiac index was higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T10 until completion of the study. Estimates of cardiac index at T30 for groups I?IV were 45?±?9, 46?±?11, 71?±?11, and 78?±?19?mL?kg?1?minute?1, respectively (mean?±?SD). Stroke index was higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T15 to T30. Values for stroke index at T30 for groups I?IV were 0.98?±?0.19, 1.11?±?0.18, 1.46?±?0.21, 1.74?±?0.33?mL?kg?1. Heart rate decreased from T10?T30 in groups I and II. Heart rate was greater in groups I and III than in groups II and IV at T5 and T0. Values for heart rate at T0 for groups I?IV were 48?±?5, 42?±?5, 50?±?4, 43?±?4 beats?minute?1. Systolic arterial pressure, DAP and MAP were higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T5 to T30. There were no differences in SVR between groups. Dobutamine at 0.001?mg?kg?1?minute?1 increased cardiac output, blood pressure, and stroke volume. Premedication with xylazine at 0.5?mg?kg?1 did not appear to affect the response to dobutamine.

AB  - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is commonly seen in dogs and cats and presents a spectrum of disease severities from acute to chronic and mild to severe. It is usually sterile, but the causes and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. The acute end of the disease spectrum is associated with a high mortality but the potential for complete recovery of organ structure and function if the animal survives. At the other end of the spectrum, chronic pancreatitis in either species can cause refractory pain and reduce quality of life. It may also result in progressive exocrine and endocrine functional impairment. There is confusion in the veterinary literature about definitions of acute and chronic pancreatitis and there are very few studies on the pathophysiology of naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs and cats. This article reviews histological and clinical definitions and current understanding of the pathophysiology and causes in small animals by comparison with the much more extensive literature in humans, and suggests many areas that need further study in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Background Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is frequent in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) creating significant burden on patients, families, and emergency departments (ED). The objective of the project was to reduce the admission rate for children with SCD presenting to our ED with VOC by >20% within 6 months of initiating individualized pain plans (IPP). Methods A multi-disciplinary quality improvement team was assembled. A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) format was employed. The IPP document was created in a unique folder within the electronic medical record. IPPs were created through retrospective chart review for our 80 highest resource users. Pediatric residents, ED residents, and ED attending physicians were instructed on use of the IPPs. Our study measured the presence of an IPP, adherence to the IPP, and time to opiate administration. Our primary outcome was admission rate. Length of stay and 72-hr return to the ED were assessed as balancing measures. Results Overall, admission rate decreased by 24% following implementation compared with the previous 5 years (P = 0.046). IPPs were created for 78% of patients and followed by ED staff in 86% of visits. Admission rate was significantly lower for patients receiving a second opiate dose within 45 min of the first dose (P < 0.01). There was no difference in readmission rate or 72-hr return rate to ED. Conclusions This study presents an effective strategy to reduce admission rate for children with SCD presenting with VOC. Shorter time to second opiate dosing was also associated with reduced risk of admission.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study While open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice for most ulnar fractures conservative treatment is sometimes chosen due to financial constraints. Additional motives for the choice of treatment may be present, and the clients perception is therefore of interest. Objectives To compare survival and outcome between horses treated for an ulnar fracture, either surgically or conservatively and to assess clients perception of treatment. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Medical records and radiographs of horses treated between January 2002 and December 2012, with a diagnosis of ulnar fracture were reviewed. Information regarding short- (within 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) outcome and owner satisfaction with treatment was obtained via telephone questionnaires. Differences between groups were investigated using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results Fracture types included 11 type 4, 7 type 5, one type 2, and one type 1b fracture. Eleven horses were treated surgically (Group 1). Nine horses were managed conservatively (Group 2). Group 1: 7/11 (64%) survived >1 year, 5/11 (45%) returned to previous athletic level. In Group 2: 6/9 (67%) survived >1 year, 4/9 (43%) returned to previous athletic level. No significant difference in outcome could be detected. There was no difference in the total treatment cost for horses that stayed at the hospital (P?=?0.22). Owners in Group 1 expressed more satisfaction with the treatment than owners in Group 2. Several of the latter expressed welfare concerns regarding the prolonged stall confinement in harness involved with this treatment. Conclusions Veterinarians recommending therapy for cases of ulnar fractures should be aware that many can be treated surgically with a good outcome. Prolonged hospitalisation and stall confinement of horses treated conservatively was a major welfare concern of the owners interviewed and had the same total cost as surgical treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Every year, several equine influenza (EI) epidemics are reported worldwide. Equine influenza vaccination is the most efficient method of prevention; however, not all horses develop sufficient immunity after EI immunisation, increasing the risk of infection, infectious virus excretion and the spread of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to better understand poor vaccine response mechanisms during the primary EI vaccination. Study design Cohort study. Methods The EI humoral immune response was measured in 118 Thoroughbred foals set in 3 different stud farms (SF#1 to SF#3) after the primary course of EI vaccination. All foals were immunised with a recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, following the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. The age at first vaccination was 4 to 8 months. Sera were tested by single radial haemolysis (SRH) against the A/equine/Jouars/4/2006 EIV strain (Florida clade 2) at the time of the first vaccination (V1), 2 weeks and 3 months after the second immunisation (V2), 2 days and 3 months after the third immunisation (V3). Results Short (V2?+?2 weeks) and mid-term (V3?+?3 months) SRH antibody levels were statistically different between the stud farms (P-value?=?0.0011 and 0.003, respectively), with SF#1<SF#3<SF#2 and SF#1 SRH antibody titres below the protection threshold (i.e. 85?mm2) at all time points studied. SRH antibody levels induced by EI vaccination were related to the age of foals at the first immunisation (SF#1 median age 143 days, SF#2 median age 181 days and SF#3 median age 156 days), but were independent of the presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA; P-value 0.41). Given the results in SF#1, a booster immunisation (V4) was brought forward to restore protective levels of antibody. Conclusion Independently of the presence of MDA, the age of foals at first immunisation plays an important role in the establishment of adequate antibody levels.

AB  - This study evaluated the influences of carprofen and the experience of the surgeon on post-castration pain in lambs and young sheep castrated in the field. A total of 201, 1?6-week-old lambs with a mean body mass of 11.0?±?2.4?kg (mean?±?SD) were castrated after local application of 4?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively lambs were given either 20?mg carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. A further 34 sheep, aged 6?months, with a mean body mass of 36.0?±?4.5?kg were castrated after local application of 7?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively sheep received 2?mg?kg?1 carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. Lidocaine was injected SC in front of, behind and into each spermatic cord. All surgery was performed using the same Burdizzo clamp (jaw 45?mm wide, handles 225?mm) either by students or experienced veterinary surgeons. Pain was assessed preoperatively and at 24, 48 and 72?hours after castration by two independent observers unaware of the treatment group. Observers scored pain using a visual analog scale (100?mm) after applying gentle pressure onto the scrotal region (Thornton  20% versus 13%, p?=?0.0062 at 48?hours; 16% versus 10%, p?=?0.0088 at 72?hours) and significantly more swelling (18% versus 8%, p?=?0.0189) of the scrotal region than those castrated by veterinary surgeons. Young sheep receiving carprofen preoperatively had significantly lower pain scores (12?mm versus 25?mm, p?=?0.037) 24?hours after surgery compared to sheep receiving saline. No scrotal swelling was obvious in sheep. Juvenile sheep but not lambs, receiving carprofen preoperatively showed reduced pain scores up to 24?hours after surgery. Carprofen reduced swelling of the scrotum in lambs. Lambs castrated by experienced surgeons scored lower VAS scores at all times and showed less swelling of the scrotal region.

AB  - Abstract A 12-year-old, 4 kg, castrated male Persian cat was referred with a 2-month history of sneezing and bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. Rhinoscopically acquired nasal biopsies at this time revealed bilateral lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis. A tapering dose of oral prednisone caused the complete remission of the clinical signs, but 2 months after discontinuation of the therapy, the rhinitis recurred and the OD became exophthalmic. Computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass in both sides of the nasal cavity, both frontal sinuses, the right orbit, and to a lesser extent the left orbit. A fine needle aspirate of the right orbit revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and Aspergillus spp. hyphae. Repeat nasal biopsy demonstrated multi-focal necrosis and a mixed inflammatory cell process which now included macrophages and scattered septate fungal hyphae. A few days later the cat became bilaterally blind and a contrast enhancing lesion involving the optic chiasm was found on magnetic resonance imaging. Despite a poor prognosis, therapy consisted of exenteration of the right orbit and trephination of both frontal sinuses before the planned initiation of medical antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, the cat died of cardiac arrest intraoperatively. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from both orbits at necropsy. Orbital aspergillosis has been rarely reported in cats and its relationship with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is unclear. In this patient lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis or previous antibiotic/corticosteroid therapy may have allowed secondary fungal invasion of the nasal mucosa and subsequently both orbits and the brain. Alternatively, Aspergillus infection may have preceded the lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis.
