AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ethmoidal infection with Aspergillus spp. is rarely reported in horses. Three horses suffering from unilateral infection with Aspergillus spp. of the ethmoid with varying underlying conditions are described. Study design Case series. Methods Diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the ethmoid (presence of white mycotic plaques on a layer of thick yellow mucus) and confirmed by fungal culture (A. fumigatus) and/or cytology. Clinical details and outcome were obtained from the medical records and by contacting owners. Results Horse 1 and 2 had a progressive ethmoid haematoma (PEH) and had been treated for over 5 months with repeated formalin injections (one horse after initial surgical debulking of the PEH that also invaded the maxillary and sphenopalatine sinuses) before the infection with Aspergillus was diagnosed. The third horse, presented with poor performance and nasal discharge, had congenitally abnormal anatomy of the right dorsal nasal passage and right ethmoids. In the 2 horses with PEH the mycotic plaques were removed transendoscopically successfully. After 6 weeks the infection was no longer present at endoscopy in both horses (follow-up endoscopy: Horse 1 no relapse >16 months and Horse 2 no relapse >7 months). In the third horse, it was not possible to remove all mycotic plaques, therefore systemic treatment with itraconazole (3?mg/kg bwt q. 12?h for 8 weeks orally) was started. After 8 weeks, the clinical signs had resolved and endoscopy showed that the Aspergillus infection had cleared (follow-up: no relapse >14 months). No side effects were seen with systemic itraconazole treatment. Conclusions In horses with underlying ethmoidal conditions, secondary infection with Aspergillus spp. may occur. Transendoscopic removal of the mycotic plaques alone may be successful and if this approach is not feasible or unsuccessful, systemic treatment with itraconazole can be considered.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recent studies evaluating owner sound horses have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries but the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries have not been investigated. The increasing use of objective lameness evaluation necessitates a further characterisation of the differences between lameness and motion asymmetries. Objectives To investigate prevalence, and quantify type and magnitude of motion asymmetries during straight-line trot in riding horses, perceived sound by their owners. Study design Cross-sectional prospective study. Methods Vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 220 Warmblood riding horses, all functioning in daily work and considered sound by their owners; 100 of these individuals had been included in a previous report [1]. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hindlimb stances were calculated during straight-line trot. Previously used symmetry thresholds (absolute differences >6?mm for the head and >3?mm for the pelvic variables) were used. Results The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded for 159 horses (72%) for at least one variable, HDmax (n?=?41, mean 12.7?mm, s.d. 5.5), HDmin (n?=?58, mean 14.3?mm, s.d. 7.1), PDmax (n?=?87, mean 6.5?mm, s.d. 3.10), PDmin (n?=?77, mean 5.7?mm, s.d. 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent fore- and hindlimb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. Conclusions A surprisingly large proportion (72%) of horses perceived as sound by their owner showed movement asymmetries during straight-line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or mechanical abnormalities as opposed to ?normal variation? and this leads to 2 potential welfare problems ? either too many horses in training are actually ?lame? or many horses categorised as ?lame? have no locomotor system disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was conducted within guidelines of the participating sites institutional animal care and use procedures (C 206/10, C48/13) and informed consent for data collection was obtained from the horse owners prior to the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparison between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on the response to local anaesthesia and ultrasonography. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD were humanely destroyed. The ultrasonographic abnormalities were graded prospectively as mild, moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examined grossly and 36 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically. The histological images were graded blindly based on predefined criteria (0?3 for each tissue type; 0?=?normal, 3?=?severe abnormality). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) limbs; in 4/36 (11.1%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs. Muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Neural abnormalities (grades 1?3) were seen in 23/36 (63.9%) limbs and vascular changes (grade 1 and 2) in 2/36 (5.6%) limbs. In 1/36 limbs no abnormality was detected. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reasonably reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as a gold standard, but the ability to detect gross adhesions was limited. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Animal Health Trust and had informed consent of the owners. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Sagittal plane slab fractures of the third carpal bone are a recognised injury in the racehorse. One study [1] reported 32 horses with sagittal fractures, 69% raced again. Surgical management appeared beneficial, with all horses that underwent inter-fragmentary compression racing again. Objectives To document the success rate following sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone in UK-based racehorses, and to compare conservative and surgical management. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Inclusion criteria were Thoroughbred racehorses with a simple sagittal slab fracture of the third carpal bone. Exclusion criteria were comminuted fractures, radial carpal bone fractures and short incomplete linear lucencies. Fractures were classified as complete, incomplete or uncertain. Time from injury to next race was recorded. Success rates were compared by Fisher's exact test. Results Forty horses were identified. Two were subjected to euthanasia and 3 have <6 months follow-up. Eleven were managed nonsurgically of which 4 (36%) were complete (5 uncertain) and 7 (64%) raced, 154?508 days following injury (median 242 days). Twenty-seven horses underwent surgery to place a single 3.5?mm (n?=?26) or 4.5?mm (n?=?1) lag screw under arthroscopic guidance, of which 18 (67%) were complete. Thirteen (48%) raced again 147?711 days following surgery (median 256 days) P?=?0.48. Of 23 horses with complete fractures 13 (57%) raced again, compared with 5/15 (33%) horses with incomplete fractures P?=?0.2. Of horses with complete fractures, 10/18 (55%) underwent surgery and raced again compared to 3/4 (75%) horses managed conservatively P?=?0.62. Conclusions The results confirm that the prognosis for athletic function is favourable but do not suggest that surgery is beneficial, or necessary for complete fractures. The numbers managed conservatively are small and it was not clear radiographically if the fracture was complete in 5/11 horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Previous studies show the effect of toe or heel wedges on tendon strain but there is little understanding of the effect of other shoe types. Objectives To quantify the effect of different shoeing conditions on the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), distal check ligament (ALDDFT) and suspensory ligament (SL). Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Twelve equine cadaver forelimbs were loaded onto a force plate mimicking stance phase. Markers were placed proximally and distally in each tendon structure and tracked using a motion capture system and strain was calculated. Tendon strain was determined for the following conditions: barefoot, glue on heart bar and aluminium racing plates with and without packing material. Data were analysed using a mixed effects model. Results Significant variation in strain was observed between tendons. The DDFT had the lowest strain, then the ALDDFT, SDFT and SL. Glue on heart bar shoes significantly increased SDFT and SL strain compared to barefoot for the same leg force. Aluminium racing plates without packing material increased ALDDFT and SDFT strain and with packing material increased ALDDFT and SL. Conclusions Shoe selection should be based on minimising strain in the tendon with greatest injury risk. Aluminium racing plates with packing material may be most appropriate for the majority of racehorses as they do not significantly increase SDFT strain.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adverse effects on renal health and haemostasis have been documented in human patients administered hydroxyethyl starches (HES). Gelatins could provide useful substitutes for HES should similar adverse effects be identified in horses. Objectives To compare the effects of a 4% modified fluid gelatin (MFG) with a 130/0.4 6% tetrastarch (TES) on haemodilution, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), haemostasis and renal parameters in healthy ponies. Study design Randomised crossover. Methods Three treatments (A?=?10?ml/kg bwt TES, B?=?10?ml/kg bwt MFG and C?=?20?ml/kg bwt MFG) were administered to 6 healthy ponies with a one-week washout period. Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein (TSP), COP, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured at baseline and at multiple time points up to 24?h post infusion. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), urine protein:creatinine (UPC), urine GGT:creatinine (UGC) and urine sediment examination (USE) were performed before and 24?h after each treatment, and one week after the final treatment. Results All treatments caused significant haemodilution and increases in COP with treatment C having a significantly greater effect on PCV than other treatments. The platelet count decreased with all treatments and was significantly lower for treatment C compared with treatment B. No significant differences were observed in any TEG parameter within or between treatments. No significant differences in PT, aPTT or fibrinogen were observed between treatments. Serum creatinine, UGC and UPC did not change significantly pre- and post study. USG and USE remained within normal limits. Conclusions 4% MFG could be considered as an alternative to 130/0.4 6% TES for volume expansion and oncotic support. Neither MFG nor TES were associated with clinically significant adverse effects on haemostasis or renal parameters.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004).

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Acupuncture may be recommended for horses with ?heaves? because it is being increasingly applied to treat human asthma. Therefore, its efficacy was investigated in horses with this asthmalike disease. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a single acupuncture treatment for the relief of airway obstruction in heaves-affected horses. Methods: The efficacy of a single acupuncture treatment was tested in 10 heaves-affected horses, and the effect of removal from the dusty stall environment in 5 heaves-affected horses. Before treatment, horses were stabled to induce airway obstruction and, apart from trips to the laboratory for pulmonary function measurements, they remained stabled for the duration of each treatment. The severity of airway obstruction was quantified by measurement of lung function before treatment (baseline), and at 20, 60, 120 and 240 mins and 24 h after the following treatments administered in random order: halter restraint and patting, a single acupuncture treatment by an experienced acupuncturist, and a single acupuncture treatment using predetermined points (recipe) by a veterinarian with no acupuncture training. In a second study, horses were untreated and remained either in their stall or in a paddock for all measurements of lung function, after baseline readings were made. Results: In the first study, after all treatments, there was a temporal improvement in maximal change in pleural pressure, pulmonary resistance, dynamic compliance, respiratory rate, and tidal volume that lasted less than 24 h. There was no specific effect of acupuncture treatment. In the second study, removal from the dusty environment did not produce an improvement in lung function in the first 6 h. We conclude that most of the improvements in lung function observed in the study were due to handling. Conclusions: Assessed objectively, a single acupuncture treatment during an attack of heaves causes no more improvement in lung function than does handling the horse. Potential relevance: Acupuncture should not replace conventional medical treatments for heaves.

All rights reserved Abstract: Superficial fungal infections are fairly prevalent in transplant recipients and the incidence increases with more intense graft-conserving immunosuppressive therapy. Majocchi's granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytes that involves deeper layers of the dermis. Only a few case reports of the condition have been documented in transplant recipients. After an extensive review of the medical literature, 21 cases were retrieved and are summarized here, together with a new case that occurred in a recent heart transplant recipient from our institution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, with special focus on potential risk factors, offending pathogens, clinical presentation, therapeutic approaches, and outcome. General observations are presented emphasizing the relevance of close clinical and dermatologic follow-up in high-risk SOT patients with specific comments regarding treatment regimens and outcomes.

AB  - Summary. Background:? Orthopedic surgery, especially total knee and total hip arthroplasty, is considered a risk factor for peri-operative venous thromboembolism. Objectives:? This study evaluates how accelerated inflammatogenic cellular interactions and the subsequent production of tissue factor and CD40 ligand play an important role in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. Patients and methods:? Twenty-four patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to groups with (Ti; n?=?12) and without (Tn; n?=?12) pneumatic tourniquet inflation. Results:? Numbers of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, especially those comprising monocytes-platelets in central venous blood from the Ti group, were increased during the peri-operative period (P?<?0.01), and returned to the baseline level at 24?h after starting surgery. Levels of PAC-1, P-selectin, CD40 ligand, tissue factor, Mac-1 expression on monocytes including monocyte-platelet aggregates, and the number of microparticles including those of endothelial cell origin were noticeably increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Whole blood coagulability was also obviously increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Furthermore, the concentrations of venous plasma tissue factor antigen, CD40 ligand, platelet factor 4, ?-thromboglobulin, the soluble fibrin monomer complex and prothrombin fragment 1+2 were also increased (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? This study showed that platelet, leukocyte and endothelium activities as well as their interactions are enhanced during the peri-operative period of total knee arthroplasty, particularly in venous blood from the lower half of the body, which consequently augments blood coagulability. Further, tourniquet inflation during surgery exaggerates these responses.

AB  - Abstract Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and carry a dismal prognosis. Despite aggressive therapy with maximal safe surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors invariably are refractory to or become resistant to treatment and recur. Gliomas are highly infiltrative cancers and display remarkable genetic heterogeneity making them challenging to treat. Recent progress has been made in understanding the molecular and genetic composition of these tumors and from this, promising new targets for therapy have emerged. In particular, anti-angiogenesis therapies have led to modest success in disease control. In addition, the growing body of research in cancer immunology as well as cancer stem cells has made inroads in our understanding of tumorgenesis. Translational research has been particularly crucial to the development of these therapies as much preclinical and clinical work is needed to develop the rationale for treatments, to develop biomarkers of drug activity and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance. This brief overview will discuss some of the pivotal advances made in the pursuit of improved outcomes and survival for patients with this devastating disease.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: F2-isoprostanes have been used extensively to quantify lipid peroxidation in association with risk factors in various diseases. Horses with colic may have intestinal ischaemia and/or inflammation characterised by oxidative stress and increased production of isoprostanes. Objectives: To gather preliminary data regarding the feasibility of using urine F2-isoprostanes and isoprostane metabolites as early screening tools for the presence of gastrointestinal disease requiring surgical intervention in horses and ultimately develop a stall-side test capable of identifying these horses as early as possible for timely referral. Methods: Concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were determined by mass spectroscopy and normalised to urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in urine samples from 42 healthy control horses and 43 horses with gastrointestinal pain or colic. Results: Horses with colic were treated medically (n = 21) or surgically (n = 22). Mean ± s.d. concentrations of urine isoprostane and isoprostane metabolite were significantly higher in horses with colic (2.94 ± 1.69 and 0.31 ± 0.22?ng/mg Cr, respectively), compared to control horses (1.89 ± 1.39 and 0.22 ± 0.08?ng/mg Cr, respectively). Mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in horses undergoing surgery (0.38 ± 0.28?ng/mg Cr) compared to controls and medical colics (0.26 ± 0.11?ng/mg Cr). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher mean urine isoprostane metabolite concentrations (0.47 ± 0.39?ng/mg Cr) than control or surviving colic horses (0.29 ± 0.24?ng/mg Cr). Conclusions: Measurement of urine isoprostane metabolite concentration may be a useful prognostic indicator in equine colic. Potential relevance: Urine isoprostane metabolites may aid in early recognition of surgical colic. Isoprostanes are a potential therapeutic target to prevent further systemic and gastrointestinal tissue injury in horses with colic.

AB  - Abstract Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is an emerging tick-borne disease. It is spread by the black-legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis that serves as the vector for six human pathogens. HGA is still rarely reported in solid organ transplant recipients. In solid organ transplant recipients, orchitis has been reported secondary to chickenpox, tuberculosis and infections due to Listeria monocytogenes and Nocardia asteroides. Orchitis as a presenting feature of HGA infection has only been reported in animals. We present a unique case of a renal transplant recipient with HGA that presented as orchitis. We also compare the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of our patient with other cases of HGA in transplant recipients. To the best of our knowledge, our patient is one of the first cases of A phagocytophilum mono-infection causing a classical presentation of orchitis in a transplant patient.

AB  - Background: Combustible tobacco use is generally linked with accelerated periodontal bone loss and diminished post-surgical wound healing; however, the pathogenesis of this process at the cellular level remains unclear. Nicotine is known to affect human gingival fibroblast orientation, attachment, and ?1 integrin expression, yet little is known about its effects on osteoclasts, the cells most responsible for bone resorption. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of physiologically relevant nicotine levels on porcine osteoclast function as measured by resorption of calcium phosphate. Methods: Pure nicotine was diluted in medium to the following concentrations: 0.03 µM, 0.15 µM, 0.30 µM, 0.60 µM, and 1.50 µM. Porcine osteoclasts were seeded onto calcium phosphate multi-test slides and incubated at 37°C with half media changes every 24 hours. Cells received 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.50 µM nicotine, or 25 nM parathyroid hormone (PTH). Osteoclast resorption was quantified by measuring the resorbed surface area of the calcium phosphate substrate. Results: Osteoclast cultures resorbed bone slices and calcium phosphate substrate. All nicotine concentrations and PTH resulted in statistically significantly greater mean percent resorptions than the control group (P <0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between the various nicotine doses or PTH. The number of osteoclasts increased in a linear relationship to the increasing nicotine concentrations; however, no correlation was found between osteoclast number and the amount of resorption. Conclusions: Nicotine is non-toxic to osteoclasts at the clinically relevant levels tested. Nicotine appears to stimulate osteoclast differentiation and resorption of calcium phosphate, the major component of bone. Nicotine-modulated osteoclast stimulation may, in part, explain the increased rapidity of periodontal bone loss and refractory disease incidence in smokers. J Periodontol 2003;74:1440-1446.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries. Ethical Animal Research The local Animal Care and Ethics Committee advised that no formal approval was required for this study.
