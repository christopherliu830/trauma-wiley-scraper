AB  - Introduction In endurance racing, horses are required to complete distances of up to 160?km in a single day. To date, the energy expenditure (EE) of such effort has not been quantified. This study aimed to evaluate EE during a 160?km endurance race from heart rate (HR) monitoring. Methods Three weeks before competing, two endurance horses (H1 and H2) were submitted to a field exercise test to determine their individual VO2-HR relationship. VO2 and HR were recorded simultaneously at trot (13?14?km/h for 10?min), and at canter (18?19?km/h for 10?min, and 22?23?km/h for 5?min), using the equine K4b2, a portable metabolic measurement system. H1 was then enrolled in Monpazier CEI and H2 in Florac CEI. HR was monitored from 2 minutes before the start to the finishing line of each loop. EE of exercise was calculated from individual VO2-HR relationship and caloric equivalent of oxygen. Results H1 and H2 completed the race at an average speed of 17.02 and 14.46?km/h, respectively. Mean HR was 108?±?8 and 124?±?24 and peak HR was 169 and 204 for H1 and H2, respectively. The proportion of time spent at HR≥180 was 0 and 2.7% for H1 and H2 respectively. EE of exercise was evaluated at 177 and 240?MJ for H1 and H2 respectively. Conclusions A 160-km endurance race might present a considerable energy cost, at least 5 times the EE of non-working state.

AB  - Introduction High concentrate diets increase the risk of several health problems and high energy forage diets could therefore be an alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the number of horses and the number of races performed at the age of three by a group of 16 Standardbred horses fed a forage only-diet from the age of 1.5 years (F) with the results of their siblings (S). Methods To F-horses, a forage diet was offered ad libitum (10.2?11.7?MJ metabolisable energy, 10?16% crude protein/kg dry matter) and supplemented daily with minerals and vitamins to meet requirements. F-horses were trained by pupils at the National Trotting School during supervision of professional trainers. For each individual in the F-group, the mean racing results from a maximum of five older siblings (same mother) were used for the S-group (5 siblings, n?=?9; 4-3 siblings, n?=?4 and 1?2 siblings, n?=?3). The siblings selected were born closest in time in relation to the F individual. S-horses were trained by different trainers and it was assumed that they had been fed a conventional high concentrate diet. Racing results were obtained from the Swedish Trotting Association. ANOVA and a Tukey test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in the number of horses that competed (F: 56% vs S: 54%, SE 10) and in the number of races performed (F: 1.6 vs S: 2.9, SE 0.5). Conclusions The study indicates that a forage-only diet may not be a limitation to achieve conventional training results and could therefore be an alternative to conventional diets. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee in Umeå, Sweden.

AB  - Introduction Marcha is typically a low intensity/medium duration exercise that has the potential to induce oxidative stress. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that supplementation with oil would alter biomarkers of oxidative stress in four-beat gaited horses during marcha training. Methods Eleven gaited horses underwent training for 60?min (?60% consisting of marcha at ?3.5?m/s) 3?d/wk for eight weeks. Subjects were fed elephant grass (?15?kg/day) and concentrate (?5?kg/day). They were also supplemented with 300?mL of oil per os (vitamin E: 300?IU/kg, omega-3: 300?g/kg; omega-6: 80?g/kg) and had free access to water and salt. Blood samples were collected before and after four and eight weeks of supplementation for the measurement of GPx, SOD, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, TPP, urea, creatinine and uric acid. ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for statistical analysis (P<0.05). Results Increases in GPx (?12%), SOD (?51%) and uric acid (?19%) were observed after 8 week of supplementation (P<0.05). There were changes (P<0.05) in [urea] and [creatinine]; however, there were no changes (P>0.05) in RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit or WBC. Published research has demonstrated that administration of supplements with antioxidants enhances the antioxidant system and protects against oxidative stress during exercise. Supplementation with oil, rich in vitamin E, omega-3 and -6, produced a beneficial increase in antioxidant capacity in gaited horses during training. Conclusions The elevation in [GPx], [SOD] and [uric acid] in the present study offers a strategy to counterbalance the physiologic processes that overwhelm endogenous antioxidants during training.

AB  - Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis are common inflammatory conditions of the canine central nervous system. Although each disease has unique histopathological features, these canine disorders collectively seem to be aberrant immune responses directed against the central nervous system. A review of the neurological signs and general neurodiagnostic approach to canine meningoencephalitis is followed by an overview of the specific clinical and neuropathological features of granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis. The aetiopathogenesis of each disorder is explored including potential genetic, immunological, and environmental factors along with the current and prospective immunomodulatory therapies for meningoencephalitis.

AB  - Abstract The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is an important physiologic barrier that separates CNS from soluble inflammatory mediators and effector immune cells from peripheral circulation. The optimum function of the BBB is necessary for the homeostasis, maintenance, and proper neuronal function. The clinical and experimental findings have shown that BBB dysfunction is an early hallmark of various neurologic disorders ranging from inflammatory autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and traumatic diseases to neuroinvasive infections. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the regulation of BBB function under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. Several neurologic disease-modifying drugs have shown to improve the BBB function. However, they have a broad-acting immunomodulatory function and can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. The recent development of in vitro multicomponent 3-dimensional BBB models coupled with fluidics chamber as well as a cell-type specific reporter and knockout mice gave a new boost to our understanding of the dynamics of the BBB. In the review, we discuss the current understanding of BBB composition and recent findings that illustrate the critical regulatory elements of the BBB function under physiologic and inflammatory conditions, and also suggested the strategies to control BBB structure and function.

AB  - Abstract Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most severe public health problem affecting both sexes but females are more susceptible due to the differences in urogenital and reproductive anatomy, physiology and lifestyle. As in UTI, different parts of the urinary tract are affected and morbidity due to UTI is more common in women of all ages and older men. Due to multi-drug resistant strains and high recurrence rate, UTI has become a major socioeconomic burden. The current review article was aimed to describe the natural therapeutic strategies to manage and cure the UTI. For this purpose, different databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane database, and PubMed etc. were explored. Inclusion criteria were any research article investigating the current therapy of UTI. It was found that microbial infections including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella species are the major causes of UTI with different signs and symptoms including painful urination or dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency, burning micturition, frequent urination, nausea, and vomiting. Antibiotics like trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, quinolone etc. as the first choice of the drug are used worldwide. However, due to microbial resistance, several life-threatening side effects, repeated high doses, high cost and low efficacy of these antibiotics motivated the researchers to explore natural remedies for the treatment of UTI. Herbal medicines are effective to combat bacterial resistance with high efficacy, and easy availability with minimal or no side effects. For these reasons it has attained the attention of researchers wanting to explore the herbal treatment of UTI. Vaccinium macrocarpon, Tribulus terrestris, Trachyspermum copticum, Cinnamomum verum and Hybanthusenn easpermus are some common medicinal plants reported to have therapeutic potential for the management and cure of the UTI. Although herbal medicines have more potential over conventional medicine but more discoveries are required to explore the phytoconstituents and their mechanism of action responsible for the management and cure of UTI.

AB  - ABSTRACT A distinct type of liver disease is described in 21 cats. It is characterized morphologically by monolobular fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates which surround and permeate bile ducts and proliferation of bile ductules of varying intensity. The most common clinical signs are ascites, jaundice and hypergammaglobulinaemia. The condition appears to progress through an active stage of intense lymphocytic infiltration and proliferation of bile ductules to a stage of progressive monolobular fibrosis which results in distortion of liver architecture. The rate of progression is very variable. The condition differs from that of ascending or suppurative cholangitis described in the cat and bears only superficial resemblances to various forms of cholangitis in man and other species. At present the aetiology is unknown but it is suggested that genetic and immunological factors may predispose certain animals to produce hepatic lesions after exposure to a variety of environmental factors.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The foal requires an active hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis for organ maturation and post natal survival. Prenatal administration of synthetic glucocorticoids may provide an effective method for inducing fetal maturation safely in the mare. Objectives: To determine whether dexamethasone administered to late pregnant mares: 1) will induce fetal maturation and precocious delivery; 2) is safe to use and 3) to identify endocrine responses in the mare and foal. Methods: Pregnant Thoroughbred mares received either 100?mg dexamethasone i.m. (treated n = 5) or 50?ml saline i.m. (control n = 5) at 315, 316 and 317 days of gestation. Plasma progestagens, cortisol and prostaglandin F2α metabolite (PGFM) concentrations were measured before and after treatment. The foals were weighed, the crown-rump length (CRL) measured and an adrenal stimulation test performed on Day 1. Results: Dexamethasone significantly (P<0.01) reduced gestation length in treated mares without apparent adverse effects. Plasma progestagens increased (P<0.05), and cortisol and PGFM (P<0.05) decreased, following dexamethasone treatment compared with control mares. Foals were clinically mature but those from dexamethasone treated mares had reduced (P<0.05) CRL, but not bodyweights, compared with controls. Their cortisol concentrations increased following exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation but 2 foals from dexamethasone treated mares showed evidence of adrenal suppression. Conclusions: Dexamethasone stimulates precocious fetal maturation and delivery in healthy late pregnant mares. However, fetal HPA activity may be suppressed. Potential relevance: Dexamethasone treatment could be used to improve foal viability in mares at risk of preterm delivery. The endocrine effects of such a therapy must be evaluated before clinical intervention with glucocorticoids can be recommended.

AB  - ABSTRACT The current experiments examined the impact of early-life immune activation and a subsequent mild immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 25µg/kg) on hippocampal-dependent learning, proinflammatory cytokine expression in the brain, and peripheral immune function in juvenile male and female rats at P24, an age when hippocampal-dependent learning and memory first emerges. Our results indicate that neonatal infection did not produce learning deficits in the hippocampal-dependent context pre-exposure facilitation effect paradigm in juvenile males and females, contrary to what has been observed in adults. Neonatal infection produced an increase in baseline IL-1? expression in the hippocampus (HP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of juvenile rats. Furthermore, neonatally infected rats showed exaggerated IL-1? expression in the HP following LPS treatment as juveniles; and juvenile females, but not males, showed exaggerated IL-1? expression in the mPFC following LPS treatment. Neonatal infection attenuated the production of IL-6 expression following LPS treatment in both the brain and the spleen, and neonatal infection decreased the numbers of circulating white blood cells in juvenile males and females, an effect that was further exacerbated by subsequent LPS treatment. Together, our data indicate that the consequences of neonatal infection are detectable even early in juvenile development, though we found no concomitant hippocampal-dependent learning deficits at this young age. These findings underscore the need to consider age and associated on-going neurodevelopmental processes as important factors contributing to the emergence of cognitive and behavioral disorders linked to early-life immune activation. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Background Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) is a recently described form of interstitial pneumonia associated with the presence of equine herpesvirus type 5 (EHV-5). Since 2007, several case reports from America, Europe and the United Kingdom have further characterised the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of this disease. Case reports Three Thoroughbred broodmares were diagnosed with EMPF. Diagnosis was based on lung histopathology and positive identification of EHV-5 using PCR DNA amplification. There was multiple organ involvement in all three cases, including identification of EHV-5 in hepatic tissue in one case. Two of the three horses died. Treatment with acyclovir was unsuccessful in one horse and one horse survived without antiviral or corticosteroid treatment. Conclusion This case series is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report of EMPF in Australia and adds to the clinical description of the disease.

AB  - As infectious complications from blood transfusion have decreased because of sophisticated blood screening, non-infectious side-effects have emerged as the most common complications of transfusion in industrialized countries. Despite making every endeavour, quite a number of these side-effects are very difficult to control. Some of these side-effects present as acute transfusion reactions, the most important of which are transfusion-related acute lung injury, circulatory overload, sepsis, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Acute adverse events require immediate action, but are often difficult to evaluate. On the other hand, transfusion recipients may experience delayed non-infectious side effects, including, non-ABO haemolytic transfusion reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura. In addition, a not well-defined risk of increased mortality following blood transfusion has been recognized. Some aspects regarding the clinical presentation, the physiology behind, and possible preventive measures are summarized here.

AB  - Abstract. This is a transcript of the 1999 SAEM State-of-the-Art session on ?Therapeutic Controversies in Severe Acute Asthma,? presented at the 1999 SAEM annual meeting in Boston. The aim of this session was to address some of the current controversies in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, a major issue in emergency medicine. Despite many recent advances in asthma management, morbidity and mortality remain high. While many of us have strong feelings on how asthma patients should be treated, many of our assertions are not based on good science, and there are numerous areas of controversy. This discussion focuses on the controversy over beta agonist treatment for acute asthma, the physiology of corticosteroids in asthma, and the emergency use of leukotriene-modifying agents.

AB  - Objectives To document the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and to assess resolution of these abnormalities following corticosteroid therapy. Materials and Methods Steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis was diagnosed based on signalment, physical examination findings, complete blood count, biochemistry and CSF analysis. Echocardiography, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I were measured in all cases before and 10 to 14 days after commencing corticosteroid therapy. Fibrinogen was also measured in a proportion of dogs. Results Fourteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Increased cardiac troponin I was identified in five of 14 dogs and echocardiographic abnormalities were detected in 12 of 14 dogs, including spontaneous echo contrast (12 of 14), mild pericardial effusion (five of 14) and mildly decreased fractional shortening (five of 14). All dogs had increased C-reactive protein and fibrinogen was increased in 11 of 12. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with clinical improvement and normalisation of C-reactive protein in all dogs. The cardiac troponin I levels normalised in four of five and fibrinogen had normalised in all five dogs which were retested. Spontaneous echo contrast improved or completely resolved in 12 of 12 and pericardial effusion resolved in five of five dogs. Fractional shortening normalised in two of five dogs. Clinical Significance Cardiac changes are common in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and most resolve with therapy. Further investigation into the cause and significance of these changes is necessary in determining whether antithrombotic therapy or positive inotropic therapy is indicated.

AB  - SUMMARY 1 Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) protects the heart and kidneys against ischaemia?reperfusion (I/R) injury. It has been shown that opioid receptor activation can mimic cardiac IPC. In a kidney model of I/R, a single dose of morphine failed to mimic IPC. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of chronic morphine (dependence) in protection against renal I/R injury. 2 Male Wistar rats were treated with increasing doses of morphine (20?30 mg/kg per day, s.c., for 5 days) to develop morphine dependence (MD). Three weeks before the I/R procedure, the right kidney was removed. Ischaemia?reperfusion injury was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 45 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion. Some MD rats were pretreated with naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.). Twenty-four hours later, creatinine and sodium concentrations were measured in serum and urine, then creatinine clearance (CCr) and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) were calculated. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured only in serum samples. Kidneys were also assessed histologically for evidence of tissue injury. 3 In the present study, MD decreased tissue injury (histological score), serum creatinine and BUN levels, increased CCr and decreased FENa after I/R. Pretreatment with naloxone attenuated the protective effects of MD. Morphine dependence did not have any significant effect on urine volume. 4 In conclusion, it seems that morphine dependence protects the kidney against I/R injury via opioid receptor-dependent pathways. Further studies are required to clearly determine the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Objectives To perform a preliminary study to assess whether single-agent palliative or adjuvant chemotherapy has an impact on objectively measured physical activity in dogs. Methods Fifteen dogs with neoplasia (treatment group) wore ActiGraph? accelerometers for 5-day periods before, during and after receiving single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy. Mean 5-day total physical activity and time spent in three different intensities of activity (sedentary, light-moderate and vigorous) before, during and after receiving chemotherapy were compared to a group of 15 healthy dogs (control group). Results were also compared within the treatment group across time. Results Prior to chemotherapy, treated dogs tended to be less active than control dogs. Treatment group dogs were slightly more active at restaging than they were prior to treatment but had similar activity levels to control dogs. Marked effects of chemotherapy on physical activity were not detected. Physical activity was slightly lower in treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared to control dogs but there was a slight increase in physical activity of treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared with pretreatment recordings. There was little change in the mean 5-day total physical activity between treated dogs during chemotherapy and at restaging but a mild decrease in time spent sedentary and increase in time spent in light-moderate activity at this comparison of time points. Clinical Significance Single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy had minimal impact on physical activity levels in dogs with neoplasia.
