AB  - Abstract A seven-year-old male castrated mixed-breed dog was diagnosed with bilateral subconjunctival masses. In vivo confocal microscopy facilitated visualization of Onchocerca lupi adult nematodes and their characteristic cuticular morphology. Long, thin, white nematodes were extracted during excisional biopsy. Histopathologic and parasitologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of O. lupi. In addition to surgical debulking of the parasitic granulomas, the dog received systemic doxycycline, prednisone, and ivermectin therapy. In vivo confocal microscopy was repeated one year after initial diagnosis, and no remaining nematodes were visible. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of use of in vivo confocal microscopy as a noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring tool for canine onchocerciasis.

AB  - Abstract Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic relapsing pruritic skin disease of dogs for which treatment has varied over time and geographical location. Recent high quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have established which drugs are likely to offer consistent benefit. The International Task Force for Canine AD currently recommends a multi-faceted approach to treat dogs with AD. Acute flares should be treated with a combination of nonirritating baths and topical glucocorticoids, once an attempt has been made to identify and remove the suspected causes of the flare. Oral glucocorticoids and antimicrobial therapy must be added when needed. In dogs with chronic AD, a combination of interventions should be considered. Again, factors that trigger flares of AD must be identified and, if possible, avoided. Currently recognized flare factors include food, flea and environmental allergens, Staphylococcus bacteria and Malassezia yeast. Skin and coat hygiene and care must be improved by bathing with nonirritating shampoos and dietary supplementation with essential fatty acids. The severity of pruritus and skin lesions can be reduced with a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs. Currently, medications with good evidence of high efficacy include topical and oral glucocorticoids, and calcineurin inhibitors such as oral ciclosporin and topical tacrolimus. The dose and frequency of administration of these drugs should be tailored to each patient considering each drug?s efficacy, adverse effects and cost. Allergen-specific immunotherapy should be offered, whenever feasible, in an attempt to prevent recurrence of clinical signs upon further exposure to environmental allergens to which the patient is hypersensitive.

AB  - Incurable ulcer in the lower legs means avascular skin defects exposing bone and osteomyelitis which cannot be repaired even with skin grafting. A total of 151 patients with incurable ulcers were operated with flaps; 60 cases of traumatized avascular defects, 20 diabetic ulcers, 17 osteomyelitis, 14 malignant tumors, 5 arterial obstructions, and 5 arteriovenous malformations, and others. A total of 61 island flaps were used; 20 posterior tibial perforator flaps, 7 saphenous flaps, 7 peroneal flaps, 4 anterior tibial flaps, 4 malleolar perforator flaps, 4 medialis pedis flaps, and others. In addition, a total of 82 free flaps using microvascualr anastomosis were sued; 24 flow-through anterior thigh flaps, 13 flow-throuh thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps (or latissimus dorsi MC flap), 8 paraumbilical (or deep inferior epigastric artery ) perforator flap, 6 saphenous venous flaps, 7 combined flaps, and 24 others. In conclusions, small ulcers could be repaired with minimal invasive methods including local perforator flaps and small muscle flaps under local anesthesia. Free flow-through flaps and free bypass flaps (for diabetic gangrene with ASO), and combined osteocutaneous flaps (for massive segmental defects after resecting advanced carcinoma) are indicated for large ischemic defects.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.

AB  - Summary Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous disease with the hallmarks of alveolar capillary membrane injury, increased pulmonary oedema and pulmonary inflammation. The most common direct aetiological factor for ALI is usually parenchymal lung infection or haemorrhage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALI. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) plays an important role both in production of ROS as well as their removal through the supply of NADPH. However, how G6PD modulation affects NOX2-mediated ROS in the airway epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury has not been explored previously. Therefore, we investigated the effect of G6PD inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide on G6PD activity, NOX2 expression, ROS production and enzymatic anti-oxidants in AECs in a mouse model of ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ALI led to increased G6PD activity in the AECs with concomitant elevation of NOX2, ROS, SOD1 and nitrotyrosine. G6PD inhibitor led to reduction of LPS-induced airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration as well as NOX2-derived ROS and subsequent oxidative stress. Conversely, ALI led to decreased glutathione reductase activity in AECs, which was normalized by G6PD inhibitor. These data show that activation of G6PD is associated with enhancement of oxidative inflammation in during ALI. Therefore, inhibition of G6PD might be a beneficial strategy during ALI to limit oxidative damage and ameliorate airway inflammation.

AB  - Overproduction of interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis (MG), and thymectomy can cause myasthenic crisis because of surgically induced overproduction of IL-6. Preoperative steroid therapy is beneficial in preventing MG crisis during the perioperative period. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of preoperative steroid therapy on proinflammatory mediators during the perioperative period of transsternal thymectomy for MG. The study group comprised 20 consecutive MG patients undergoing transsternal thymectomy during the period March 2002 through March 2004. Seventeen of these patients received dose-escalated steroid therapy before thymectomy (steroid treatment group) and three did not (non-steroid treatment group). Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 were determined during the perioperative period; clinical outcomes were reviewed, and the results were compared between the two groups. Peak serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in the steroid treatment group than in the non-steroid treatment group. Amongst perioperative variables subjected to multiple regression analysis, preoperative steroid treatment were found to be the most significant independent predictor of inhibited IL-6 production on postoperative day 1. No postoperative respiratory failure occurred in the steroid treatment group, but it did occur in the non-steroid treatment group. Preoperative steroid therapy can ameliorate IL-6 overproduction and may help stabilize the patient's postoperative condition.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract Deficiency of vitamin B12 is a well known cause of megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. Splenomegaly and leukoerythroblastosis are much less well known manifestations of B12 deficiency. We report a B12 deficient female with severe pancytopenia including normocytic anemia who also had enlarged spleen and circulating nucleated red blood cells as well as circulating immature myeloid cells. Although these findings are reported in the earlier literature, more modern reviews of the subject often fail to mention this association. We review the literature on these unusual manifestations of B12 deficiency and remind clinicians that splenomegaly and erythroblastosis can serve as diagnostic clues in cases of severe megaloblastic anemia secondary to B12 deficiency.

AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian epimorphic regeneration is rare and digit tip regeneration in mice is the best-studied model for a multi-tissue regenerative event that involves blastema formation. Digit tip regeneration parallels human fingertip regeneration, thus understanding the details of this response can provide insight into developing strategies to expand the potential of human regeneration. Following amputation, the digit stump undergoes a strong histolytic response involving osteoclast-mediated bone degradation that is spatially and temporally linked to the expansion of blastema osteoprogenitor cells. Blastemal differentiation occurs via direct intramembranous ossification. Although robust, digit regeneration is imperfect: The amputated cortical bone is replaced with woven bone and there is excessive bone regeneration restricted to the dorsal?ventral axis. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic analysis of digit regeneration in amphibians and mammals raise the possibility that mammalian blastema is a product of convergent evolution and we hypothesize that digit tip regeneration evolved from a nonregenerative precondition. A model is proposed in which the mammalian blastema evolved in part from an adaptation of two bone repair strategies (the bone remodeling cycle and fracture healing) both of which are conserved across tetrapod vertebrates. The view that epimorphic regeneration evolved in mammals from a nonregenerative precondition is supported by recent studies demonstrating that complex regenerative responses can be induced from a number of different nonregenerative amputation wounds by specific modification of the healing response.

AB  - Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution is increasingly used to flush and preserve organ donor kidneys, with efficacy claimed equivalent to University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. We observed and reported increased graft pancreatitis in pancreata flushed with HTK solution, which prompted this review of transplanting HTK-flushed kidneys. We analyzed outcomes of deceased-donor kidneys flushed with HTK and UW solutions with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, excluding pediatric and multi-organ recipients. We evaluated patient and graft survival and rejection rates, variables that might constitute hazards to graft survival and renal function. Two-year patient survival, rejection, renal function and graft survival were not different, but early graft loss (<6 months) was worse in HTK-flushed kidneys (p < 0.03). A Cox analysis of donor grade, cold ischemic time, panel reactive antibodies (PRA), donor race, first vs. repeat transplant, rejection and flush solution showed that only HTK use predicted early graft loss (p < 0.04; relative risk = 3.24), almost exclusively attributable to primary non-function (HTK, n = 5 (6.30%); UW, n = 1 (0.65%); p = 0.02). Delayed graft function and early graft loss with HTK occurred only in lesser grade kidneys, suggesting it should be used with caution in marginal donors.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Pathological specimens from columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) comprise a considerable proportion of the workload of gastrointestinal pathologists in Western countries. There remain controversies concerning the diagnostic role of pathology. More recently, in the UK at least, the diagnosis has been regarded as primarily an endoscopic endeavour, with pathology being corroborative and only diagnostic when endoscopic features are equivocal or when there are additional features that make the endoscopic diagnosis unclear. There is also recognition that demonstration of intestinalisation or ?goblet cells? is not paramount, and should not be required for the diagnosis. There have been notable changes in the management of CLO neoplasia: pathologists are centrally involved in its management. Pathological assessment of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) specimens provides the most useful means of determining the management of early neoplasia and of determining indications for surgery. This represents an extraordinarily rapid change in management, in that, <10 years ago, laborious Seattle-type biopsy protocols were recommended, and high grade dysplasia was an indication for resectional surgery. Now, individual patient management is paramount: multi-professional meetings determine management after biopsy and EMR assessment. One significant change is that major resections are undertaken less often, in Western countries, for CLO neoplasia.
