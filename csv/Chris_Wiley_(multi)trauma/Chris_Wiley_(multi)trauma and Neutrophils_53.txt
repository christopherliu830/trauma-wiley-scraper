AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Summary Hypertonic saline has been in clinical use for many decades. Its osmotic and volume-expanding properties make it theoretically useful for a number of indications in critical care. This literature review evaluates the use of hypertonic saline in critical care. The putative mechanism of action is presented, followed by a narrative review of its clinical usefulness in critical care. The review was conducted using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network method for the review of cohort studies, randomised-controlled trials and meta-analyses. The review focuses specifically on blood pressure restoration and outcome benefit in both haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic shock, and the management of raised intracranial pressure. Issues of clinical improvement and outcome benefit are addressed. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective for blood pressure restoration in haemorrhagic, but not other, types of shock. There is no survival benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions in shock. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective at reducing intracranial pressure in conditions causing acute intracranial hypertension. There is no survival or outcome benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions for raised intracranial pressure. Recommendations for clinical use and future directions of clinical research are presented.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Abstract: The etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis ? one of the most common chronic, inflammatory, hyperproliferative skin disorders of man ? have long fascinated dermatologists, pathologists and biologists alike. Here, we have a model disease that offers to study neuroectodermal-mesenchymal interactions in the widest sense possible. Epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells as well as neurons projecting into the skin apparently all interact with each other to generate the characteristic psoriatic lesion. For decades, the ongoing controversy on the molecular nature, choreography and hierarchy of these complex interactions e.g. between epidermal keratinocytes, T cells, neurotrophils, endothelial cells and sensory nerves has served as a driving force propelling investigative dermatology to ever new horizons. This debate has not only been at the heart of our quest to develop more effective forms of therapy for this socially crippling disease, but it also has profoundly influenced how we view the skin as a whole: the numerous competing theories on the pathogenesis of psoriasis published so far also are reflections on the evolution of mainstream thought in skin biology over the last decades. These days, conventional wisdom ? infatuated with a T-cell-centered approach to inflammatory skin diseases ? portrays psoriasis as an autoimmune disease, where misguided T lymphocyte activities cause secondary epithelial abnormalities. And yet, as this CONTROVERSIES feature reminds us, some authoritative ?pockets of academic resistance? are still quite alive, and interpret psoriasis e.g. as a genetically determined, abnormal epithelial response pattern to infectious and/or physicochemical skin insults. Weighing the corresponding lines of argumentation is not only an intriguing, clinically relevant intellectual exercise, but also serves as a wonderful instrument for questioning our own views of the skin universe and its patterns of deviation from a state of homeostasis.

AB  - The hemopoietic growth factors are peptide hormones that are known to be responsible for the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of bone marrow progenitor cells into mature differentiated cells. These cytokines have had a major impact on the management of patients with cytopenias and have been extensively used as an adjunct to the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, with or without prior intensive chemotherapy. Other potential uses, being rigorously studied, include the potential mobilization of stem cells as well as recruitment phase-specific cells into the cell cycle, thus providing a more sensitive environment for targeting specific chemotherapeutic agents.

Wounds in the oral cavity are particularly challenging given the variety of tissue types that exist in close proximity to one another. The goal of regenerative medicine is to facilitate the rapid replacement of lost or damaged tissue with tissue that is functional, and physiologically similar to what previously existed. This review provides a general overview of wound healing and regenerative medicine, focusing specifically on how recent advances in the fields of stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and oral disease could translate into improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - Summary Fibrosis by common usage in the pathological and clinical literature is the end result of a healing process and synonymous with scarring. We would argue that its use to describe a dynamic series of events which may be reversible is unhelpful and that the term ?lung remodelling? is a better description for this process as it reflects changes in tissue organization that may or may not progress to ?fibrosis? as a final fixed point. Resolution, through reversal of active lung remodelling, by therapeutic intervention is possible providing the alveolar architecture remains intact. If the lung architecture is lost then healing by permanent fibrosis with loss of organ function is inevitable.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Summary Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of transfusion of blood and blood components. TRALI is under-diagnosed and under-reported because of a lack of awareness. A number of models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of TRALI: an antibody mediated model; a two-event biologically active mediator model; and a combined model. TRALI can occur with any type of blood product and can occur with as little as one unit. Its presentation is similar to other forms of acute lung injury and management is predominantly supportive. The main strategy in combating TRALI is prevention both through manipulation of the donor pool and through clinical strategies directed at reducing transfusion of blood products including, but not limited to, evidence-based lower transfusion thresholds. This article presents a review of TRALI and addresses the definition, pathology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention of the syndrome.

AB  - Summary Platelets play a critical role at the interphase of thrombosis and inflammation, key features in haemolysis-associated disorders. Exercising this role requires expression of pattern recognition receptors by platelets, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein 3 (NLRP3), the latter forming intraplatelet multiprotein inflammasome complexes. Platelets are a potential target of various damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, such as free haem, a degradation by-product of haemoglobin oxidation during haemolysis, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a DNA-binding protein released by dying or stressed cells and activated platelets. We have recently identified platelet TLR4, NLRP3, and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) as critical regulators of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, suggesting that the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is a potential therapeutic target. Increasing evidence suggests that these and other DAMP-driven signalling mechanisms employed by platelets might be key in mediating inflammation and thrombosis encountered in haemolytic disorders. However, the precise regulatory triggers and their clinical relevance are poorly understood. We provide new insights into these less-well characterised platelet mechanisms, which are potentially targetable in haemolytic disorders.

AB  - Objectives Permanent injury to the cranial nerves can often result in a substantial reduction in quality of life. Novel and innovative interventions can help restore form and function in nerve paralysis, with bioelectric interfaces among the more promising of these approaches. The foreign body response is an important consideration for any bioelectric device as it influences the function and effectiveness of the implant. The purpose of this review is to describe tissue and functional effects of chronic neural implantation among the different categories of neural implants and highlight advances in peripheral and cranial nerve stimulation. Data Sources: PubMed, IEEE, and Web of Science literature search. Review Methods: A review of the current literature was conducted to examine functional and histologic effects of bioelectric interfaces for neural implants. Results Bioelectric devices can be characterized as intraneural, epineural, perineural, intranuclear, or cortical depending on their placement relative to nerves and neuronal cell bodies. Such devices include nerve-specific stimulators, neuroprosthetics, brainstem implants, and deep brain stimulators. Regardless of electrode location and interface type, acute and chronic histological, macroscopic and functional changes can occur as a result of both passive and active tissue responses to the bioelectric implant. Conclusion A variety of chronically implantable electrodes have been developed to treat disorders of the peripheral and cranial nerves, to varying degrees of efficacy. Consideration and mitigation of detrimental effects at the neural interface with further optimization of functional nerve stimulation will facilitate the development of these technologies and translation to the clinic.

AB  - Abstract On May 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized sepsis as a global health priority by adopting a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of this deadly disease. While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, pivotal observations based on clinical flow cytometry indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, some septic patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This paved the way for immunostimulation approaches in sepsis. Clinical flow cytometry permitted this evolution by drawing a new picture of pathophysiology and reshaping immune trajectories in patients. Additional information from cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry and other high-dimensional flow cytometry platform should rapidly enrich our understanding of this complex disease. This review reports on landmarks of clinical flow cytometry in sepsis and how this single-cell analysis technique permitted to breach the wall of decades of unfruitful anti-inflammatory-based clinical trials in sepsis. ? 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Summary Background Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Studies have implicated the immune response, especially monocyte/macrophages as being important in dictating outcome. Aim To investigate changes in the circulating monocytes and other immune cells serially in patients with ALF, relate these with cytokine concentrations, monocyte gene expression and patient outcome. Methods In a prospective case?control study in the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, 35 consecutive patients admitted with paracetamol-induced liver failure (POD-ALF), 10 patients with non-paracetamol causes of ALF and 16 controls were recruited. The peripheral blood monocyte phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry, circulating cytokines quantified by protein array and monocyte gene expression array performed and related to outcome. Results On admission, patients with worst outcomes after POD-ALF had a significant monocytopenia, characterised by reduced classical and expanded intermediate monocyte population. This was associated with reduced circulating lymphocytes and natural killer cells, peripheral cytokine patterns suggestive of a ?cytokine storm? and increased concentrations of cytokines associated with monocyte egress from the bone marrow. Gene expression array did not differentiate patient outcome. At day 4, there was no significant difference in monocyte, lymphocyte or natural killer cells between survivors and the patients with adverse outcomes. Conclusions Severe paracetamol liver failure is associated with profound changes in the peripheral blood compartment, particularly in monocytes, related with worse outcomes. This is not seen in patients with non-paracetamol-induced liver failure. Significant monocytopenia on admission may allow earlier clarification of prognosis, and it highlights a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
