AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - Background: The present study evaluated the efficacy of controlledrelease delivery of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) on clinical parameters and on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 levels in chronic periodontitis patients. Methods: Twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were screened for 6 months. Two interproximal sites were selected from mesial surfaces of anterior teeth with probing depths of 6 to 8 mm that bled on probing in each patient. There were at least 2 teeth between the selected sites. CHX chip was inserted into a randomly selected site following scaling and root planing (SRP+CHX), while the other selected site received only SRP in each patient. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), and papilla bleeding index (PBI) were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. GCF MMP-8 levels were analyzed at baseline; 2 and 10 days; and at 1, 3, and 6 months by immunofluorometric assay (IFMA). Results: At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean PD, CAL, PBI, and PI scores between SRP+CHX and SRP alone groups. At 1, 3, and 6 months, all clinical parameters in each group significantly decreased (P <0.0167) when compared to baseline. The reduction of PD and improvement in CAL were higher in the SRP+CHX group compared to SRP alone at 3 and 6 months. However, the differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. PBI and PI scores were not significantly different between SRP+CHX and SRP alone groups at any visit. GCF MMP-8 levels were similar in both groups at baseline. Intragroup analysis showed significant decreases in the GCF MMP-8 level for the SRP+CHX group between baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months (P <0.01). Intergroup analysis demonstrated significantly lower mean levels of GCF MMP-8 at 1 month in the SRP+CHX group compared to the SRP alone group (P <0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that CHX chip application following SRP is beneficial in improving periodontal parameters and reducing GCF MMP-8 levels for 6 months' duration. The use of a chairside MMP-8 dipstick periodontitis test might be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool when monitoring the course of CHX chip treatment. J Periodontol 2002;73:608-615.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle continuously adapts to changes in its mechanical environment through modifications in gene expression and protein stability that affect its physiological function and mass. However, mechanical stresses commonly exceed the parameters that induce adaptations, producing instead acute injury. Furthermore, the relatively superficial location of many muscles in the body leaves them further vulnerable to acute injuries by exposure to extreme temperatures, contusions, lacerations or toxins. In this article, the molecular, cellular, and mechanical factors that underlie muscle injury and the capacity of muscle to repair and regenerate are presented. Evidence shows that muscle injuries that are caused by eccentric contractions result from direct mechanical damage to myofibrils. However, muscle pathology following other acute injuries is largely attributable to damage to the muscle cell membrane. Many feaures in the injury-repair-regeneration cascade relate to the unregulated influx of calcium through membrane lesions, including: (i) activation of proteases and hydrolases that contribute muscle damage, (ii) activation of enzymes that drive the production of mitogens and motogens for muscle and immune cells involved in injury and repair, and (iii) enabling protein-protein interactions that promote membrane repair. Evidence is also presented to show that the myogenic program that is activated by acute muscle injury and the inflammatory process that follows are highly coordinated, with myeloid cells playing a central role in modulating repair and regeneration. The early-invading, proinflammatory M1 macrophages remove debris caused by injury and express Th1 cytokines that play key roles in regulating the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of satellite cells. The subsequent invasion by anti-inflammatory, M2 macrophages promotes tissue repair and attenuates inflammation. Although this system provides an effective mechanism for muscle repair and regeneration following acute injury, it is dysregulated in chronic injuries. In this article, the process of muscle injury, repair and regeneration that occurs in muscular dystrophy is used as an example of chronic muscle injury, to highlight similarities and differences between the injury and repair processes that occur in acutely and chronically injured muscle. ? 2011 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Summary The components and reactions of the fibrinolysis system are well understood. The pathway has fewer reactants and interactions than coagulation, but the generation of a complete quantitative model is complicated by the need to work at the solid-liquid interface of fibrin. Diagnostic tools to detect disease states due to malfunctions in the fibrinolysis pathway are also not so well developed as is the case with coagulation. However, there are clearly a number of inherited or acquired pathologies where hyperfibrinolysis is a serious, potentially life-threatening problem and a number of antifibrinolytc drugs are available to treat hyperfibrinolysis. These topics will be covered in the following review.

AB  - Summary Entrance of air into the pleural cavity results in positive intrapleural pressure that causes collapse of the lungs, with a subsequent drop in venous return and cardiac output. In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Thoracocentesis should be performed when pneumothorax is suspected and it might be required as a life-saving procedure prior to radiographic or ultrasonographic confirmation of air accumulation. In more severely affected animals, tachypnea and respiratory distress can occur, or collapse can result from pneumomediastinum accompanied by pneumothorax. Mediastinitis or a mediastinal mass effect can result from fungal infection causing enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, or by bacteria directly inoculated through the thoracic wall or entering via an esophageal or tracheal route. Chylothorax is caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid from the thoracic duct into the pleural cavity.

AB  - Although originally described as a highly conserved nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair, high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) has emerged as a key mediator in the regulation of immune responses to infection and sterile injury by exhibiting all the properties of a prototypic ?alarmin?. These include rapid passive release in response to pathogenic infection and/or traumatic injury, active secretion providing for chemotactic and cytokine-like function and an ability to resolve inflammation, including tissue repair and remodelling. In this review, we will give an overview of the post-translational modifications necessary for such diversity in biological activity, concentrating particularly on how differences in oxidation of highly conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues can potentiate inflammatory responses and dictate cellular fate. We will also review the most recent literature on HMGB1 and its involvement in the pathophysiology of sepsis and cancer, as well as cancer therapy-induced mucositis.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in an immediate loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site and is associated with a poor prognosis. The inhibitory environment that develops in response to the injury is mainly due to local expression of inhibitory factors, scarring and the formation of cystic cavitations, all of which limit the regenerative capacity of endogenous or transplanted cells.Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective.Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemolytic reactions developing during hemodialysis usually are caused by oxidant damage, reduction injury, and osmolar, thermal, and mechanical injury to the red blood cells. Mechanical injury due to maloccluded blood pumps, arterial line collapse, and use of subclavian hemodialysis catheters has been reported. We report one episode of acute hemolysis due to kinked hemodialysis blood lines complicated with pancreatitis. Case Report:?An 18-year-old man with end-stage renal failure of unknown origin had been on hemodialysis since 2002. His past medical history included asthma and hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting during the dialysis session. Laboratory examination showed hematocrit ?30?%, platelet count of 131,000 per cubic mL, LDH ?5151?U/L, haptoglobin ?0.09?g/L, lipase ?919?U/L, CPK- 260, ASAT ?584?U/L, ALAT- 316?U/L, bilirubin ?36??mol/L, and visible schistocytes on smear. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse discomfort and tenderness in epigastrium. The patient was diagnosed as having hemolysis-induced acute pancreatitis. He was treated symptomatically and recovered within a few days. We found the arterial blood line tightly kinked at the dialyser inlet port, and we excluded other reported causes of intravascular hemolysis during hemodialysis. Discussion:?Until a critical pressure is exceeded, despite a kink in the post pump predialyser blood tubing, the blood pump can maintain sufficient blood flow to prevent an increase in the arterial pressure with a triggering of the arterial alarm and a decrease in the venous pressure with a triggering of the venous alarm. Thus, an excessively high pressure can be maintained in this silent segment of the dialyser tubing without activating the pressure alarms, exposing the red blood cells to high sheer stresses and resulting in clinically significant hemolysis. Acute hemolysis can cause a life-threatening acute pancreatitis. The literature indicates that acute pancreatitis is a complication of massive hemolysis with a prevalence of about 20%. The important role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is well known. Heme released from hemoglobin after episodes of vascular hemolysis has the potential to act as a signalling molecule involved in the triggering of the inflammatory processes associated with massive hemolysis. Hemolysis itself may induce acute pancreatitis by all or some pathways of neutrophil activation and chemoattraction, such as oxidative burst, direct proinflammatory effect, microcirculatory disturbance, and increased expression of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines.

AB  - Abstract? Our bacterial residents are deadly Janus-faced indwellers that can lead to a sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. Over half of ICU patients suffer from infections and sepsis remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Severe ileus frequently accompanies sepsis setting up an insidious cycle of gut-derived microbial translocation and the copious intestinal production of potent systemic inflammatory mediators. Few therapeutic advances have occurred to prevent/treat the sequelae of sepsis. Here, we selectively review studies on cellular membrane-bound Toll-like receptor (TLR) mechanisms of ileus. Virtually, no data exist on Gram-positive/TLR2 signaling mechanisms of ileus; however, TLR2 is highly inducible by numerous inflammatory mediators and studies using clinically relevant scenarios of Gram-positive sepsis are needed. Specific Gram-negative/TLR4 signaling pathways are being elucidated using a ?reverse engineering? approach, which has revealed that endotoxin-induced ileus is dually mediated by classical leukocyte signaling and by a MyD88-dependent non-bone marrow-derived mechanism, but the specific roles of individual cell populations are still unknown. Like TLR2, little is also know of the role of flagellin/TLR5 signaling in ileus. But, much can be learned by understanding TLR signaling in other systems. Clearly, the use of polymicrobial models provides important clinical relevancy, but the simultaneous activation of virtually all pattern recognition receptors makes it impossible to discretely study specific pathways. We believe that the dissection of individual TLR pathways within the gastrointestinal tract, which can then be intelligently reassembled in a meaningful manner, will provide insight into treatments for sepsis.
