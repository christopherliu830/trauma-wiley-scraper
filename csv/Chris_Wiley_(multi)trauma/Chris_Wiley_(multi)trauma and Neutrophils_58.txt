AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Summary The transfusion of platelets to patients with impaired haematopoiesis, with bone marrow aplasia induced by chemotherapy and with a variety of miscellaneous disorders of platelet number and function has provided life-saving supportive therapy. This chapter discusses the preparation and preservation of platelet concentrates and indications for platelet transfusions. The author reports three cases and experiments which furnish additional evidence to show that the blood platelets play a part in stopping haemorrhage, and that one type of haemorrhagic disease may be attributed to an extreme reduction in the number of platelets. The object of transfusing allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cells is to establish a permanent graft of transfused progenitor cells in the recipient. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) may occur when the Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains strong leucocyte antibodies.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This study was designed to investigate the role of apoptosis on liver IR injury and to determine the effects of roscovitine on this process. Materials and methods: Rat livers pretreated with roscovitine received 60?min right lobe ischemia followed by 4?h (n=8) and 24?h (n=8) reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated by serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tissue malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase measurements and histological examination. Dead (apoptotic and necrotic) hepatocytes were determined by trypan blue dye and apoptosis was evaluated with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Administration of roscovitine significantly decreased both apoptotic and dead hepatocyte counts compared to controls (P<0.01). Liver transaminase levels were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-pretreated groups (P<0.05). In the groups evaluated 24?h after reperfusion, MPO levels (P<0.02) and leukocyte infiltration on histologic sections were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-administered group compared to its control. Conclusions: This study indicates that hepatocyte apoptosis may play a role in the development of IR injury of the liver. Administration of roscovitine may be beneficial in preventing this injury.
