AB  - Abstract Objective: This study was designed to investigate the role of apoptosis on liver IR injury and to determine the effects of roscovitine on this process. Materials and methods: Rat livers pretreated with roscovitine received 60?min right lobe ischemia followed by 4?h (n=8) and 24?h (n=8) reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated by serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tissue malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase measurements and histological examination. Dead (apoptotic and necrotic) hepatocytes were determined by trypan blue dye and apoptosis was evaluated with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Administration of roscovitine significantly decreased both apoptotic and dead hepatocyte counts compared to controls (P<0.01). Liver transaminase levels were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-pretreated groups (P<0.05). In the groups evaluated 24?h after reperfusion, MPO levels (P<0.02) and leukocyte infiltration on histologic sections were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-administered group compared to its control. Conclusions: This study indicates that hepatocyte apoptosis may play a role in the development of IR injury of the liver. Administration of roscovitine may be beneficial in preventing this injury.

AB  - Abstract Background? Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). Methods? We report the atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a 36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu?s arteritis. Results? Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole monotherapy. Conclusion? The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine and to describe the assessment of IR injury, the available testing methods, and the options available for treatment. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: The assessment of IR injury includes measuring products formed by the reaction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with biological membranes, measuring levels of endogenous antioxidants, and measuring ROS themselves. Testing depends on the laboratory used, the test method chosen, the sample submitted (i.e., plasma, urine, tissue, etc.), and the timing of the test in relation to sample collection. For this reason, testing is not standardized and pharmacological data on antioxidant effectiveness are not available. Antioxidants and drugs tested have included single agents as well as ?cocktails? consisting of several agents working at different key points in the injury cascade. Conclusions: There are several new testing methods as well as new strategies for attempting to ameliorate the damage inflicted upon reperfusion and this article is intended as a review of the assessment and treatment of IR injury.

AB  - Abstract Glomerular crescents are most common in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis but also occur in non-inflammatory chronic glomerulopathies; thus, factors other than inflammation should trigger crescent formation, eg vascular damage and plasma leakage. Here we report that Alport nephropathy in Col4A3-deficient Sv129 mice is complicated by diffuse and global crescent formation in which proliferating parietal epithelial cells are the predominant cell type. Laminin staining and transmission and acellular scanning electron microscopy of acellular glomeruli documented disruptions and progressive disintegration of the glomerular basement membrane in Col4A3-deficient mice. FITC-dextran perfusion further revealed vascular leakage from glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space, further documented by fibrin deposits in the segmental crescents. Its pathogenic role was validated by showing that the fibrinolytic activity of recombinant urokinase partially prevented crescent formation. In addition, in vitro studies confirmed an additional mitogenic potential of serum on murine and human parietal epithelial cells. Furthermore, loss of parietal cell polarity and unpolarized secretion of extracellular matrix components were evident within fibrocellular crescents. Among 665 human Alport nephropathy biopsies, crescent formation was noted in 0.4%. We conclude that glomerular vascular injury and GBM breaks cause plasma leakage which triggers a wound healing programme involving the proliferation of parietal cells and their loss of polarity. This process can trigger cellular and fibrocellular crescent formation even in the absence of cellular inflammation and rupture of the Bowman's capsule.

AB  - Summary Cumulative evidence indicates a role for the complement system in both pathology and recovery after ischemic stroke. Here, we review the current understanding of the dual role of complement in poststroke injury and recovery, and discuss the challenges of anti-complement therapies. Most complement directed therapeutics currently under investigation or development systemically inhibit the complement system, but since complement is important for immune surveillance and is involved in various homeostatic activities, there are potential risks associated with systemic inhibition. Depending on the target within the complement pathway, other concerns are high concentrations of inhibitor required, low efficacy and poor bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, approaches to target complement inhibitors to specific sites have been investigated. Here, we discuss targeting strategies, with a focus on strategies developed in our lab, to specifically localize complement inhibition to sites of tissue injury and complement activation, and in particular to the postischemic brain. We discuss various injury site-specific targeted complement inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic stroke treatment, as well as their use as investigative tools for probing complement-dependent pathophysiological processes.

AB  - Abstract This report describes the cytologic features of molluscum contagiosum presenting clinically as a left thigh abscess in a 29-yr-old male with AIDS. the fine-needle aspiration findings are correlated with the histologic and ultrastructural findings. Molluscum contagiosum's clinical presentation, natural course, and induction of host immune responses in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals as identified by light microscopy, immunocytochemically and ultrastructurally are reviewed. Molluscum contagiosum presenting clinically and cytologically as an abscess is unusual. in this report, we emphasize the inclusion of molluscum contagiosum in a differential diagnosis of an abscess, particularly in immunosuppressed patients, and discuss the cytologic differential diagnoses. ? 1995 Willey- Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with substantial unmet clinical need. Airway damage and remodelling is a consequence of complex host?environment interactions and is considered to be the cardinal feature leading onto the development and persistence of airflow obstruction. In this review, we shall bring together recent insights into the causes of airway damage and remodelling that propose key roles for pathogens and mechanical damage in addition to allergens, underlying genetic susceptibility, inflammatory and structural cell interactions, and impaired resolution of damage. We shall consider the consequences of airway remodelling in terms of airway geometry, mechanics and clinical expression of disease. Understanding the causes and consequences of airway damage and remodelling will shed light upon the structure?function relationships required to begin to unravel the complexity of severe asthma and will enable us to target current and novel therapies as we begin to move towards realizing personalized medicine.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.
