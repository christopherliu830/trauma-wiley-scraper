AB  - Summary The vestibulocochlear organ is a multi-part structure that consists of the external, middle, and inner ear. Given that it can be readily observed on physical examination, the external ear is the focus of this chapter. The purpose of the external ear is to funnel sound toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. This facilitates the special sense of hearing. Although ear shape and structure vary depending upon breed standard, the function of the organ is essentially the same. In order to preserve the sense of hearing, the pinnae need to operate independently of one another, and the external ear needs to be open, as opposed to stenotic. The ear canal also needs to be free of excessive hair, cerumen, or other debris. Abnormal aural presentations are common in clinical practice and include both those problems that are limited to the pinnae and those that involve the external ear canal. Aural hematomas, infestation with Sarcoptes and Notoedres mange mites, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affect primarily the pinnae. By contrast, otitis externa involves inflammation of the external ear canal. Otitis externa is a frequent occurrence in both dogs and cats. Patients with long, droopy ears, excessive ear canal hair, or extensive swimming and/or bathing histories may be predisposed due to the potential for reduced aeration and increased moisture within the ears themselves. Patients with otitis may present with malodorous ears and irritation. Clinical signs frequently include head shaking, pawing, or scratching at the ears, and/or reluctance to allow the clinician to perform otoscopy. Otoscopy and cytology are important diagnostic tools that allow for reliable characterization of aural debris. Interpretation of aural cytology requires the clinician to recognize what constitutes normal resident flora of the ear canal. Bacterial and fungal overgrowth versus infection are important distinctions to make. Culture and drug susceptibility profiles may be indicated as follow-up diagnostic aids, particularly in cases of chronic or recurrent otitis externa, or when the patient's response to therapy is poor. The clinician must also make every attempt to identify the primary cause of aural disease. Ear infections are typically the result of other underlying conditions, including allergic skin disease, autoimmune disease, metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, and parasitic infestation. Without managing these primary causes, otitis externa is likely to recur.

AB  - The technique involving filtration of diluted blood enables the separate analysis of the flow properties of different cell subpopulations. This study was designed to assess the changes occurring in the flow properties and function of blood cells in stored bank blood and salvaged blood compared to patient blood in a given clinical situation. We measured hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils and the filterability, through 5??m Nucleopore filters, of isolated red blood cells and of diluted blood. Samples were obtained from patients undergoing aortic surgery and blood intended for transfusion: either salvaged during surgery or stored bank blood. Both salvaged and bank blood were much less filterable than patient blood, with reduced deformability of both red and white blood cells. However, salvaged blood contained highly activated neutrophils with a prolonged transit time of the ?fast-flowing? cells in the analysis compared to bank blood. Bank blood contained significantly more particles which acted as pore-blockers. Cells in bank and salvaged blood therefore have markedly abnormal flow and biochemical properties compared to patient blood.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - Summary The high mortality in neonatal sepsis has been related to both quantitative and qualitative differences in host protective immunity. Pretreatment strategies to prevent sepsis have received inadequate consideration, especially in the premature neonate, where outcomes from sepsis are so dismal. Aluminium salts-based adjuvants (alum) are used currently in many paediatric vaccines, but their use as an innate immune stimulant alone has not been well studied. We asked whether pretreatment with alum adjuvant alone could improve outcome and host innate immunity in neonatal mice given polymicrobial sepsis. Subcutaneous alum pretreatment improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis in both wild-type and T and B cell-deficient neonatal mice, but not in caspase-1/11 null mice. Moreover, alum increases peritoneal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis, and decreases bacterial colonization in the peritoneum. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from alum-pretreated neonates produce more neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and exhibit increased expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) after in-vitro stimulation with phorbol esters. In addition, alum pretreatment increases bone marrow and splenic haematopoietic stem cell expansion following sepsis. Pretreatment of neonatal mice with an alum-based adjuvant can stimulate multiple innate immune cell functions and improve survival. These novel findings suggest a therapeutic pathway for the use of existing alum-based adjuvants for preventing sepsis in premature infants.

AB  - The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is anendotoxin-binding neutrophil leukocyte-granule protein withantibacterial and anti-endotoxin properties. A recombinant form of BPI(rBPI21) has been developed and is being tested as atherapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections andexposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a targetantigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCAare present in cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appearsassociated with a higher inflammatory disease activity and greaterorgan damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at otherneutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecificeffects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCAmay further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI topromote clearance of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associatedendotoxin.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract Liver cell death induced by stresses such as ischemia-reperfusion, cholestasis and drug toxicity can trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). A similar inflammatory response can be induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as endotoxin. Both DAMPs and PAMPs activate through toll-like receptors the resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver. Central to this inflammatory response is promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by these phagocytes. ROS are the principal toxic mediators by which inflammatory cells kill their targets, e.g. bacteria during host defense but also hepatocytes and other liver cells. The mechanism of ROS-induced cell killing during inflammation involves the promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to oncotic necrosis and less apoptosis. The additional release of cell contents amplifies the inflammatory injury. However, an inflammatory oxidant stress insufficient to directly cause cell damage can induce transcription of stress defence genes including antioxidant genes. This preconditioning effect of ROS enhances the resistance against future inflammatory oxidant stress and promotes the initiation of tissue repair processes. Despite the substantial progress in our understanding of mechanisms of inflammatory liver injury during the last decade, more research is necessary to better understand the role of ROS in acute liver inflammation and to develop clinically applicable therapeutic strategies that selectively target the detrimental effects of oxidant stress without compromising the vital function of ROS in host defense.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

Diagnostic investigation revealed a marked septic peritonitis. The inciting cause was detected by gastroscopy to be a perforating foreign body in the pylorus of the stomach from a briar of a blackthorn plant (Prunus spinosa spp.). Successful removal of the foreign body was achieved surgically via gastrotomy. The horse subsequently developed a multi-drug resistant abdominal incision site infection, which was successfully managed over a 2-month period. Abdominal incisional herniation occurred thereafter. Six months post-operatively, the horse was back in light work and no further adverse sequelae had been noted.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Abstract Background Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a bone metabolism disorder involving systematic inflammation activation. Blood routine examination is easily available in clinical practice and contains abundant information reflecting the systematic inflammation level. Thus, it is attractive to achieve early diagnosis of PMOP and predict osteoporotic fracture risk just based on the biomarkers in blood routine examination. Methods A multi-centric prospective cohort study was designed and enrolled postmenopausal women from two independent institutions. All participants underwent the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for diagnosing PMOP. Blood routine examination was conducted, and the key inflammatory biomarkers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated. PMOP patients were followed up to observe osteoporotic fracture and identify the related risk predictors. Results A total of 92 participants out of 238 enrolled postmenopausal women were diagnosed with PMOP, with a prevalence of 38.66%. The main risk factors identified for PMOP included older age (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.14-3.72), longer menopause duration (OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.06-4.79), higher NLR (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.37-3.25), and higher SII (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.98-4.61). Besides age and menopause duration, SII ≥834.89 was newly identified as a prominent risk factor for discriminating osteoporotic fracture risk in PMOP patients (HR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.249-10.71). Conclusion As an easy and economical biomarker calculated from blood routine examination, SII not only acts as a good risk predictor for PMOP diagnosis but also well discriminates the osteoporotic fracture risk, which deserves further investigation and application in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome is a complex immune deficiency characterized by chronic eczematous dermatitis, recurrent staphylococcal infections, pneumatoceles, reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, and variably impaired T cell function. Although decreased interferon-? (IFN-?) production in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome is pointed out and known as a cause of reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, precise mechanism of their inadequate production of IFN-? remains unknown. To elucidate the pathogenesis of the defective production of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, we assessed the in vitro production and secretion of IFN-? by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Methods: Chemotaxis of neutrophils, mRNA levels of several cytokines, intracellular production and extracellular secretion of IFN-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 by PBMCs from three patients with hyper-IgE syndrome were determined. Results: The transcription of IFN-? mRNA and the production of its protein molecules progressed normally. However, selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? molecules was found in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome.Confocal laser scanning microscopy clearly demonstrated the accumulation of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Conclusion: We demonstrated that there was a selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. We hope that this fact would offer a new paradigm for understanding this disease.

AB  - Abstract. This case report of severe periodontitis concerns a young male patient with chronic idiopathic neutropenia seen between 1981 and 1983 by the School of Dental Medicine of Geneva and from 1984 to 1988 by the Eastman Dental Hospital of London. The patient was maintained by intermittent systemic antibiotics, subgingival chlorhexidine irrigation, conventional debridement, brushing, and wire-mesh and composite splinting of loose teeth. After leaving school, at the patient's express wish, the extreme downhill pattern of the periodontitis resulted in removal of affected teeth and overdenture construction. The extracted teeth and associated soft tissues were examined for relevant plaque and host response features. The intact morphotypes associated with the advancing front of the lesion were invariably Gram-negative or positive coccoid cells, or less commonly short rods, as in all documented forms of periodotitis. Connective tissue destruction was associated with a leucocyte accumulation comprising mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and plasma cells. Both were observed degenerated more deeply than in routine adult periodontitis, including PMN lysosome loss and lymphocyte maturation within peripheral blood vessels. Only in one instance, one part of the superficial connective tissue of one block contained bacteria. It was concluded that the features of plaque and the lesion suggest a typical first line of defence response as in other forms of periodontitis. From the consideration of the 10 years clinical history of the patient, it is clear that non-surgical management is possible even in extreme cases, without any compromise of the patient's oral or systemic health, and in accord with the patient's wishes.

AB  - Summary Characterization of host immune cell parameters prior to treatment is expected to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical outcome as well as to elucidate why some patients fail to respond to immunotherapy. We monitored blood immune cells from 58 patients with non-small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing surgery of the primary tumor and from 50 age-matched healthy volunteers. Complete leukocyte blood count, the number of circulating dendritic cells (DC), HLA-DRlow monocytes and several lymphocytic subpopulations were determined by eight-color flow cytometry. Furthermore, the prognostic value of the immune cell parameters investigated was evaluated by patients? survival analysis. Compared to the control group, blood of NSCLC patients contained more neutrophils resulting in a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), but a lower number of blood DC, in particular of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), natural killer (NK) cells and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, a higher frequency of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and HLA-DRlow monocytes was detected, and smoking had a significant impact on these values. HLA-DRlow monocytes were positively correlated to the number of neutrophils, monocytes and NLR, but negatively associated with the number of pDC and naive CD4+ T cells. The frequency of Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as the ratios of CD4/HLA-DRlow monocytes and HLA-DRlow monocytes/pDC correlated with patient?s overall survival. Next to Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive T cells represent prognostic markers for NSCLC patients and might be useful for monitoring of patients? responses to immunotherapies in future studies.

AB  - SUMMARY The sequence of events leading to the formation of a psoriatic plaque induced by tape-stripping was studied using light and electron microscopy. Among the earliest changes noted were increased mobility of the epidermal Langerhans cells across the basement membrane, evidence of Langerhans cell-lymphocyte interaction, and increased Langerhans cell ?activity? or ?cytotoxicity?. These changes were seen as early as 2 min after stripping and remained until the development of clinical psoriasis. Collections of epidermal lymphocytes showing the features of blastoid transformation while in contact with processes from activated Langerhans cells, suggest the involvement of la antigens in this process. We postulate that these findings are a manifestation of an increased immune responsiveness to trauma, controlled by genes located at the HLA-D locus of the major histocompatibility complex, and mediated by enhanced cellular interactions. The appearance of basal keratinocyte herniations (BKH) at 1?3 weeks after stripping, coincided with the development of clinical psoriasis. Neutrophils made their appearance at the same time as, or slightly before, the appearance of BKH, and are suspected to play a role in the development of these structures. We believe that BKH maintain epidermal proliferation through the persistence of the epidermal-stromal interaction.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013
