AB  - Summary: The T-helper 17 (Th17) lineage is a recently described subset of memory T cells that is characterized by its CD4+ status and its ability to make a constellation of cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. Although most extensively described in the autoimmunity literature, there is growing evidence that the Th17 lineage plays a significant role in mediating host mucosal immunity to a number of pulmonary pathogens. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of the Th17 lineage and Th17 cytokines in mediating mucosal immunity to both pulmonary and gastrointestinal pathogens. While we have the strongest evidence that the Th17 lineage is centrally involved in mediating the host response to Gram-negative extracellular pulmonary pathogens, this literature is rapidly evolving and demonstrates a central role for Th17 cytokines both in primary infection and in recall responses seen in vaccine studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of this literature and present possible applications of Th17-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infection.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important causes of mortality in thalassemic patients is infectious disease. Thalassemic patients develop severe invasive infection caused by microorganisms that are rare in healthy individuals. We describe the case of a 13-year-old splenectomized boy who presented with septic shock and who died 36?h after admission, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive supportive care. Serratia marcescens was isolated from cultures of blood and tracheal aspirate. It is known that rare microorganisms will cause severe community-acquired infection in splenectomized patients with thalassemia major.

AB  - Abstract Background Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in Singapore and can present as localized or disseminated disease. Methods Demographic data, clinical features, investigation results, treatments, and outcomes in patients aged <16 years diagnosed with melioidosis at KK Women's and Children's Hospital between January 2002 and January 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Data for patients with primary skin disease and those with other organ involvement were compared. Results Seventeen children were diagnosed with melioidosis. Their median age was 12.5 years (range: 2?15 years). Nine (53%) patients presented with localized cutaneous melioidosis and five (29%) with localized lymphadenitis, pneumonia, or septic arthritis. The remaining three (18%) patients had melioidosis sepsis; two of these patients died from septic shock. Treatment included an initial 1?2 weeks of IV antibiotics followed by 3?6 months of oral combination antibiotics. All cases of localized cutaneous disease resolved completely with no recurrences. Three (60%) of the five patients with localized involvement of other organ systems achieved complete resolution of disease, and the remaining two were lost from follow-up. Conclusions Although uncommon, melioidosis can occur in children living in endemic regions. Patients with localized skin disease have good outcomes with no recurrences. Systemic disease can be fatal, especially in the presence of underlying immunodeficiency. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, and treatment requires prolonged combination antibiotic therapy.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that has emerged as a prevalent source of nosocomial infections, most frequently causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. The emergence of pan-drug resistant strains magnifies the problem by reducing viable treatment options and effectively increasing the mortality rate associated with Acinetobacter infections. In light of this rising threat, research on A.?baumannii epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis is accelerating. The recent development of both in vitro and in vivo models has enabled studies probing the host?Acinetobacter interface. Bacterial genetic screens and comparative genomic studies have led to the identification of several A.?baumannii virulence factors. Additionally, investigations into host defence mechanisms using animal models or cell culture have provided insight into the innate immune response to infection. This review highlights some of the key attributes of A.?baumannii virulence with an emphasis on bacterial interactions with the innate immune system.

AB  - Summary: Seventeen patients with Behcet's syndrome were evaluated clinically, immunologically and therapeutically. The variable and extensive clinical manifestations included scantyfungiform papillae in six patients, bullous skin eruption in two, non-specific skin sensitivity in six, bladder ulceration in two, and psychoneurosis. Immunological abnormalities included raised α2 globulin in 14 patients, hypogammaglobulinaemia in one, cryoproteins in three, foetal oral mucosa antibodies in three and pemphigus antibody in two. Intradermal injection of autologous plasma produced an Arthus reaction in eight out of 11 patients tested. It is suggested that some plasma component may be responsible for vasculitis in these patients. Treatment was attempted with various combinations of corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide, phenformin and ethyloestrenol. Seven patients had a satisfactory response in that all manifestations of their syndrome were well controlled.

AB  - Abstract Effective host defense against bacterial invasion is characterized by the vigorous recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, which is dependent on the coordinated expression of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we present evidence indicating that both C-X-C and C-C chemokines are integral components of antibacterial host defense. Specifically, in vitro studies indicate that C-X-C chemokines [interleukin-8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)] and the C-C chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α) augment the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and alveolar macrophages, respectively, to phagocytose and kill Escherichia coli. In addition, the intratracheal instillation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in CD-I mice results in time-dependent production of MIP-2 and MIP-1α, and the inhibition of MIP-2 bioactivity in vivo results in decreases in lung PMN influx, impaired bacterial clearance, and early mortality. Finally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is also expressed within the lung during the evolution of Klebsiella pneumonia, and neutralization of IL-10 in vivo results in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and increases in both short- and long-term survival. In conclusion, our studies indicate that specific chemokines are important mediators of leukocyte recruitment and/or activation in bacterial pneumonia and that the expression of these chemokines is regulated by endogenously produced IL-10.

AB  - Abstract: Cytokines presently known to be involved in systemic bacterial infection are tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and the counterregulatory molecules soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra). In animal models TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? mediate organ damage, low blood pressure and fatality, whereas IL-6 is involved in infection-related manifestations, like the production of acute-phase protein and fever, and IL-8 is chemotactic to granulocytes. TNF and IL-1 increase expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and influence a number of components of the haemostatic system in favour of coagulation. The presence of cytokines in the circulation is characterized by sequential releases of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6/IL-8; however, many variations of this pattern exist during human infection. In experiments as well as in human infection TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-? have been detected, and levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 have been found to be associated with the severity of the disease. Collectively, TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? emerge as mediators of systemic infection and septic shock whereas IL-6 and IL-8 are related to other manifestations of infection. Counteracting molecules like sTNFR are released after somewhat of a delay following TNF and IL-1Ra is released concomitantly with IL-1. Probably these factors modulate the cytokine effect although their true potency in natural infection has yet to be clarified. In granulocytopenic infections TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 can be detected in scrum, and levels of TNF and IL-6 are even higher than in the normal situation in experimental animals. Antibodies to TNF inhibit bacteria-induced fatality in granulocytopenic mice. Altogether, few data related to the granulocytopenic situation are available. However, it is reasonable to believe that the altered development of granulocytopenic infections is due to changes in the cellular constitution and not to changes in cytokine production.

AB  - Stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI) are among the most frequent causes of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. The personal and financial costs for affected individuals, their families, and the broader communities are enormous. Although the mammalian CNS exhibits little spontaneous regeneration and self-repair, recent discoveries have revealed that subpopulations of glial cells in the adult forebrain subventricular zone and the spinal cord ependymal zone possess neural stem cell properties. These endogenous neural stem cells react to stroke and SCI by contributing a significant number of new neural cells to formation of the glial scar. These findings have raised hopes that new therapeutic strategies can be designed based on appropriate modulation of endogenous neural stem cell responses to CNS injury. Here, we review the responses of forebrain and spinal cord neural stem cells to stroke and SCI, the role of these responses in restricting injury-induced tissue loss, and the possibility of directing these responses to promote anatomical and functional repair of the CNS.

AB  - Abstract Over the course of 4?weeks, two female aged bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) group-housed females died after the dominant male was removed from the group and the newly dominant male persistently chased, caught and bred all females in the pen. The two aged affected females were observed exhibiting lethargy, dyspnea, with widespread necroulcerative lesions in and around the mouth, muzzle and bridge of their noses. Extensive ulcerative glossitis, necrotic bronchopneumonia with intra-nuclear inclusions and the absence of other evidence is highly suggestive that death was caused by an alphaherpes virus commonly known as herpes B virus. Herpes B virus is a potentially zoonotic disease periodically shed by macaques, which is structurally related to herpes simplex viruses I and II of humans. The emergence of fatal B virus to primates in this pen may have been associated with the combination of age and stress in the affected individuals.
