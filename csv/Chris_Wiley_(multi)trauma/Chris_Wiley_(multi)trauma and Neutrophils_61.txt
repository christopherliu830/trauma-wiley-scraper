AB  - Abstract The clinical complications of Extracorporal Circulation (ECC) have been linked to disturbances in the microcirculation. In previous experiments we found in vivo an increased Leukocyte/Endothelial (L/E) cell interaction following ECC. As a therapeutical approach to prevent these deleterious effects a new agent, incorporating Hirudin and Prostacyclin, to coate the tubing system was used. Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used on the dorsal skinfold chamber preparation in syrian golden hamsters. ECC was introduced via a micro-rollerpump (1 ml/min) and a 60 cm silicon tube (1 mm inner diameter) shunted between the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Experiments were performed in chronically instrumented, awake animals (age: 10?14 weeks, weight: 65?75 g). Control tubes were uncoated, for the experiment a PEG-Hirudin-Iloprost? coating was used. Isovolemic ECC for 20 min resulted in an increase in rolling (BL: 9 % ± 2; after 4 h: 36 %* ± 5; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05) and adherent leukocytes (BL: 24 ± 26; after 4 h: 260* ± 51; mean ± SD; p < 0.05) in postcapillary venules. The use of the coated tube system resulted in a less pronounced induction of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction (Roller: BL: 9 % ± 3; 4 h: 24 %* ± 12; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05. Sticker: BL: 28 ± 25; 4 h: 139 ± 111; mean ± SD; p < 0.05). Microhemodynamic parameters and functional capillary density were not significantly affected. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were stable. L/E interaction in the microcirculation has been established as an indicator of the systemic activation induced by blood contact to synthetic surfaces during ECC. Coating the extracorporal circuit reduced the increase in L/E interaction probably as a result of an attenuated activation of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system including a reduced platelet activation.

AB  - Minocycline is a second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been in therapeutic use for over 30 years because of its antibiotic properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is mainly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris and some sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, it has been reported that tetracyclines can exert a variety of biological actions that are independent of their anti-microbial activity, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. These findings specifically concern to minocycline as it has recently been found to have multiple non-antibiotic biological effects that are beneficial in experimental models of various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatitis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, minocycline has also emerged as the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotection. This effect has been confirmed in experimental models of ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain, and of several neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Moreover, other pre-clinical studies have shown its ability to inhibit malignant cell growth and activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus, and to prevent bone resorption. Considering the above-mentioned findings, this review will cover the most important topics in the pharmacology of minocycline to date, supporting its evaluation as a new therapeutic approach for many of the diseases described herein.

AB  - Abstract The cecum contains a high concentration of microbes, which are a combination of Gram-negative and Gram-positive flora. These bacteria range from anaerobic to facultative aerobic to aerobic organisms. In the procedure described in this unit, the ligation of the cecum produces a source of ischemic tissue as well as polymicrobial infection. This combination of ischemic/necrotic tissue and microbial infection distinguishes this multifactorial model from a number of other bacterial sepsis models, including but not limited to: bacteremia secondary to intravenous or intraperitoneal administration; fecal administration or intraperitoneal administration of fecal or bacterial plugs; colonic stents; and bacterial abscess formation.

AB  - Abstract The increasing occurrence of hospital-acquired infections and the emerging problems posed by antibiotic-resistant microbial strains have both contributed to the escalating cost of treatment. The presence of infection at the wound site can potentially stall the healing process at the inflammatory stage, leading to the development of a chronic wound. Traditional wound treatment regimes can no longer cope with the complications posed by antibiotic-resistant strains; hence, there is a need to explore the use of alternative antimicrobial agents. Pre-antibiotic compounds, including heavy metal ions and essential oils, have been re-investigated for their potential use as effective antimicrobial agents. Essential oils have potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other beneficial therapeutic properties. Similarly, heavy metal ions have also been used as disinfecting agents because of their broad spectrum activities. Both of these alternative antimicrobials interact with many different intracellular components, thereby resulting in the disruption of vital cell functions and eventually cell death. This review will discuss the application of essential oils and heavy metal ions, particularly tea tree oil and silver ions, as alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of chronic, infected wounds.
