AB  - Abstract The increasing occurrence of hospital-acquired infections and the emerging problems posed by antibiotic-resistant microbial strains have both contributed to the escalating cost of treatment. The presence of infection at the wound site can potentially stall the healing process at the inflammatory stage, leading to the development of a chronic wound. Traditional wound treatment regimes can no longer cope with the complications posed by antibiotic-resistant strains; hence, there is a need to explore the use of alternative antimicrobial agents. Pre-antibiotic compounds, including heavy metal ions and essential oils, have been re-investigated for their potential use as effective antimicrobial agents. Essential oils have potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other beneficial therapeutic properties. Similarly, heavy metal ions have also been used as disinfecting agents because of their broad spectrum activities. Both of these alternative antimicrobials interact with many different intracellular components, thereby resulting in the disruption of vital cell functions and eventually cell death. This review will discuss the application of essential oils and heavy metal ions, particularly tea tree oil and silver ions, as alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of chronic, infected wounds.

AB  - Abstract Basic phenotyping of inbred mouse strains and genetically modified mouse models usually includes the determination of blood-based parameters as a diagnostic screen for genotype effects on metabolism and organ function. A broad range of analytes, including hematological parameters, can be reliably determined in mouse blood, if appropriate samples are available. Here we describe recommended techniques for blood collection from mice and the considerations that have to be taken into account to get adequate samples for hematological investigations. Furthermore, we describe established methods used in the German Mouse Clinic (GMC) to determine hematological parameters in the mouse. Curr. Protoc.

AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Abstract The biliary system originates in the small biliary canaliculi and eventually drains into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater. Although a wide variety of liver diseases can involve the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, the four that most frequently occur in adult livers are the following: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic and large intrahepatic mechanical bile duct obstruction (BDO), and secondary (acquired) sclerosing cholangitis (SSC). These disorders each have characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and are discussed in detail in this chapter. Additionally autoimmune hepatitis that attacks bile ducts (autoimmune cholangitis) is also briefly mentioned in the section on differential diagnoses. Finally, the chapter compares PBC, PSC, and large duct obstruction and the various histologic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features aiding in the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Summary: Tissue damage occurs often in the life of mammals and is usually repaired. Dying cells are swiftly phagocytosed, but before disappearing, they alert surrounding cells to activate homeostatic programs. They release signals that recruit inflammatory cells to the site of injury, promote cell migration and cell division to replace dead cells, and activate the immune system in anticipation of microbial invasion. Many of these events involve high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a nuclear protein that is released passively when necrotic cells lose the integrity of their membranes. HMGB1 behaves as a trigger of inflammation, attracting inflammatory cells, and of tissue repair, recruiting stem cells and promoting their proliferation. Moreover, HMGB1 activates dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes their functional maturation and their response to lymph node chemokines. Activated leukocytes actively secrete HMGB1 in the microenvironment. Thus, HMGB1 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and sustains long-term repair and defense programs. DCs secrete HMGB1 several hours after contact with the first maturation stimulus; HMGB1 secretion is critical for their ability to reach the lymph nodes, to sustain the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, to prevent their activation-dependent apoptosis, and to promote their polarization towards a T-helper 1 phenotype. These immune responses will also be directed against self-antigens that DCs process at the time of injury and can lead to autoimmunity.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the human and veterinary literature on the biology of apoptosis in health and disease. Data Sources ? Data were examined from the human and veterinary literature identified through Pubmed and references listed in appropriate articles pertaining to apoptosis. Human Data Synthesis ? The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions ? Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically. Future studies may reveal methods to regulate or manipulate apoptosis and improve patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract Background? The term of acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) comprises the perforating dermatoses occurring in adult patients. Clinical and histological features of the disease are not uniform, and may resemble any of the four classic perforating disorders: elastosis perforans serpiginosa, reactive perforating collagenosis, perforating folliculitis or Kyrle's disease. Chronic renal failure and/or diabetes mellitus usually accompany this skin disease. Objective? The aim of this study was to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of acquired perforating dermatosis and to investigate the potential relationship between this disease and associated conditions. Methods? Twenty-two patients with acquired perforating dermatosis were enrolled in this study. Clinical findings of acquired perforating dermatosis and the spectrum of associated diseases were investigated. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined, and immunohistochemical stainings (elastic van Gieson and Masson trichrome stains) and periodic acid-Schiff stain were also used for histopathological evaluation. Results? Different clinical types of lesions resembling reactive perforating collagenosis, perforating folliculitis or Kyrle's disease were observed. Histopathological features were consistent with any of the four types of perforating dermatoses. Most of the patients (86.4%) had at least one systemic disease. Chronic renal failure (72.7%) and diabetes mellitus (50%) were the most commonly associated conditions. Most of the patients with diabetes mellitus (90.9%) had chronic renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy. All of the patients with chronic renal failure were on dialysis treatment. The other associated conditions were hepatitis (27.3%), anti-HCV Ab-positivity (13.6%), hypothyroidism (9.1%) and tuberculosis lymphadenitis (4.5%). Of the 22 patients, 13.6% were otherwise healthy, and 9.1% were renal transplant recipients. Conclusion? Clinicopathological findings of our study indicate that the cases with APD represent the broad spectrum of perforating disorders rather than the variants of the same disease. Although APD is frequently associated with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure, this skin disorder may also develop in patients with other systemic disorders, and in those without any medical problems. This skin disease is probably linked to dialysis treatment in patients with chronic renal failure due to diabetes mellitus or other causes.
