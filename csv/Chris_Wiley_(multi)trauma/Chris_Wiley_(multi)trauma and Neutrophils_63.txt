AB  - Summary Inflammation of the intestines is common worldwide. Infections are the major cause whereas chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CIBDs), drugs and other conditions are less frequent causes. Worldwide, enteric infections rank third among all causes of disease burden. The main infectious agents include a variety of viruses and bacterial agents. As endoscopy and colonoscopy are used more frequently, the pathologist is more likely to see small and large intestinal biopsies for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions, although histology most frequently does not contribute very much to the specific diagnosis of infections. Histology is, however, very important in chronic conditions, allowing the identification of pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, and the differential diagnosis between CIBD and drug- or infection-related conditions, such as tuberculosis and acute infectious colitis, based on the morphology of the lesions. Histological analysis is equally important for the diagnosis of inflammation in patients with a disturbed immune system, such as transplant recipients, and for the identification of rare diseases, and the diagnosis of dysplasia and complicating neoplasias.

AB  - Abstract Hemopoiesis-stimulating activity of various recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs) has been studied in four different preclinical animal models. The CSFs used were erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF, granulocyte (G) CSF, interleukin (IL) 3, IL-1?, and mast cell growth factor (MGF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Emphasis was placed on effects induced by combination treatment with varied pairs of the factors. Dogs and primates were chosen because of evidence of efficacy from earlier studies with the single recombinant human factors alone. The animal models chosen were: 1) isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 10% (or 20%) of dogs, splenectomized at least three months before start of the study. Additionally, the animals had been primed with Epo (or Epo plus IL-3) on three days daily or five days every other day before hemodilution. 2) Total body irradiation (TBI) of dogs (2.4 Gy) followed by daily treatment with IL-1? (d1-7) plus Epo administered daily over three weeks. 3) TBI of rhesus monkeys (4.5 Gy) and daily treatment with IL-3 and GM-CSF over three weeks. 4) Treatment of healthy normal cynomolgus monkeys with various factor combinations over about two or three weeks. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Priming with Epo before blood loss (withdrawal) allows a strikingly enhanced recovery of hematocrit and other hematological parameters. Further evaluation of the role of concomitantly applied CSFs (e.g., IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF) on the restoration of immune functions would be desirable. 2) Single CSFs and preferentially factor combinations are valuable agents to reduce irradiation injury and to enhance recovery from bone marrow hypoplasia. 3) Treatment of healthy animals with selected CSF combinations results in a stronger hemopoietic stimulation than with single factors alone. Some particular combinations even stimulate platelet production, e.g., IL-3/GM-CSF, GM-CSF/Epo or G-CSF/IL-3. The results obtained indicate that stimulatory responses of hemopoiesis in normal animals cannot always be compared with the effects seen in compromised animals. It is assumed that the preclinical data obtained in compromised animals may perhaps more realistically reflect what is eventually to be expected in future clinical studies.

AB  - Summary Ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for influenza virus research, as well as other disease conditions, such as Helicobacter-induced gastropathy. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a distinct idiopathic inflammatory condition of young adult ferrets. Affected animals may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, and a marked eosinophilia may be noted during routine hematologic evaluation. Hematologic changes may include nonregenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses for hypergammaglobulinemia and/or abdominal masses include Aleutian disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic infection (e.g., proliferative colitis, helicobacteriosis), idiopathic splenomegaly, multiple myeloma, other neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis are seen sporadically in ferrets. Similarly, systemic viral disease caused by infection with canine distemper virus, influenza virus, Aleutian disease (a parvovirus infection), and coronavirus may induce foci of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Nonspecific lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis may be seen with moderate regularity in surgical biopsies or tissue sections from adult ferrets as an extension of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - Abstract Angiogenesis is essential for normal bone formation and repair. Avascularity characterizes aberrant fracture union in the elderly, while angiogenic mechanisms during cutaneous wound repair are attenuated in aged humans. We hypothesized that skeletal injury results in local (circulating) and systemic (fracture site) ?angiogenic? responses and that these reparative mechanisms are attenuated with advanced patient age. This prospective study examined peripheral blood and fracture hematoma from 32 patients, 16 under 40 years and 16 over the age of 75, undergoing emergent surgery for isolated fracture. The angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were assayed. Endothelial cell cultures were supplemented with patient plasma and fracture hematoma and angiogenesis determined in vitro by measuring cell proliferation and blood vessel tube formation. Angiogenesis was determined in vivo using a murine dorsal wound pocket model and quantification of new blood vessel formation after 7 days. We found that all injured patients, irrespective of age, have elevated plasma and fracture hematoma levels of VEGF and PDGF. These elevated cytokine concentrations translate into biologically significant angiogenic effects, in vitro and in vivo. These effects are primarily VEGF mediated and are not dependent on patient age. The biological activity of these growth factors does not diminish with advanced age. Thus skeletal injury does result in local and systemic angiogenic responses whereby angiogenic cytokine availability and activity is preserved in the aged suggesting alternative mechanisms for the development of avascularity in delayed and fracture non-union in the elderly. ? 2001 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but potentially fatal disease. It is even more unusual as a primary disease of the breast. Surgical treatment is required in order to gain control over the spreading infection and mastectomy is reported to be the most common procedure. We report the first case of an otherwise healthy woman exhibiting a primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast, which was treated combining conservative surgery with hyperbaric oxygen (HO) and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). A 39-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with fever and swelling of her right breast. The physical examination showed oedema and erythema of the breast, with bluish blisters on the lower quadrant. Ultrasound and CT scans showed diffuse oedema of the entire right breast, with subdermal gas bubbles extending to the fascial planes. Few hours later the necrotic area extended regardless an IV antibiotic therapy; a selective debridement of all breast necrotic tissue was performed and repeated 7 days later. The HO was started immediately after the first surgery and repeated daily (2·8 Bar, 120 min) for 18 days and then a NPWT (120?135 mmHg) was applied. Forty-five days after the last debridement, the breast wound was covered with a full-thickness skin graft. Several months later, an excellent cosmetic result was observed. This is the first case of primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast treated associating HO and NPWT to surgical debridement only; this combination resulted in a complete recovery with the additional benefit of breast conservation. Such result is discussed in light of the available literature on the treatment of primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast.

AB  - Abstract Copper is an essential micronutrient and a key catalytic cofactor in a wide range of enzymes. As a trace element, copper levels are tightly regulated and both its deficit and excess are deleterious to the organism. Under inflammatory conditions, serum copper levels are increased and trigger oxidative stress responses that activate inflammatory responses. Interestingly, copper dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress and inflammation are commonly present in several chronic diseases. Copper exposure can be easily modeled in zebrafish; a consolidated model in toxicology with increasing interest in immunity-related research. As a result of developmental, economical and genetic advantages, this freshwater teleost is uniquely suitable for chemical and genetic large-scale screenings, representing a powerful experimental tool for a whole-organism approach, mechanistic studies, disease modeling and beyond. Copper toxicological and more recently pro-inflammatory effects have been investigated in both larval and adult zebrafish with breakthrough findings. Here, we provide an overview of copper metabolism in health and disease and its effects on oxidative stress and inflammation responses in zebrafish models. Copper-induced inflammation is highlighted owing to its potential to easily mimic pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory features that combined with zebrafish genetic tractability could help further in the understanding of copper metabolism, inflammatory responses and related diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Free-living amebae belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are the causative agents of granulomatous amebic encephalitis, a chronic progressive disease of the central nervous system, and of amebic keratitis, a chronic eye infection. Granulomatous amebic encephalitis occurs more frequently in immunocompromised patients while keratitis occurs in healthy individuals. The recent increased incidence in Acanthamoeba infections is due in part to infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, while that for keratitis is due to the increased use of contact lenses. Understanding the mechanism of host resistance to Acanthamoeba is essential since the amebae are resistant to many therapeutic agents. Studies in our laboratory as well as from others have demonstrated that macrophages from immunocompetent animals are important effector cells against Acanthamoeba. We have demonstrated also that microglial cells, resident macrophages of the brain, elicit cytokines in response to A. castellanii. Neonatal rat cortical microglia from Sprague-Dawley rats co-cultured with A. castellanii produced mRNA for the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1α, interleukin 1?, and tumor necrosis factor a. In addition, scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that microglia ingested and destroyed A. castellanii in vitro. These results implicate macrophages as playing an effector role against Acanthamoeba and suggest immune modulation as a potential alternative therapeutic mode of treatment for these infections.
