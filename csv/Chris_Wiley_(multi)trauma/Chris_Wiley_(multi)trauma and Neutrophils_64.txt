AB  - Abstract This unit describes methods for intravital imaging of monocytes in the vasculature of the dermis and the mesentery in vivo using fluorescent reporter mice, fluorescent dyes, and antibodies. Cx3cr1gfp/gfp (or +), Rag2?/?, Il2rg?/? mice expressing eGFP at the locus of the Cx3cr1 gene, on the Rag2?/? Il2rg?/? C57Bl/6 background, are used. Although aimed at specifically tracking Ly6Clow monocytes, these protocols could readily be adapted to investigate the interaction of other blood leukocytes with the vascular endothelium by use of other fluorescent reporter mice and fluorescently labeled antibodies.

AB  - Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) using superpulsed near-infrared light can penetrate deeper in the injured tissue and could allow non-pharmacological treatment for chronic wound healing. This study investigated the effects of superpulsed laser (Ga-As 904 nm, 200 ns pulse width; 100 Hz; 0.7 mW mean output power; 0.4 mW/cm2 average irradiance; 0.2 J/cm2 total fluence) on the healing of burn wounds in rats, and further explored the probable associated mechanisms of action. Irradiated group exhibited enhanced DNA, total protein, hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents compared to the control and silver sulfadiazine (reference care) treated groups. LLLT exhibited decreased TNF-α level and NF-kB, and up-regulated protein levels of VEGF, FGFR-1, HSP-60, HSP-90, HIF-1α and matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 compared to the controls. In conclusion, LLLT using superpulsed 904 nm laser reduced the inflammatory response and was able to enhance cellular proliferation, collagen deposition and wound contraction in the repair process of burn wounds. Photomicrographs showing no, absence inflammation and faster wound contraction in LLLT superpulsed (904 nm) laser treated burn wounds as compared to the non-irradiated control and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) ointment (reference care) treated wounds

AB  - ABSTRACT Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is a sophisticated system that maintains a closed, humid, sterile and isolated environment. Wound infection is considered a relative contraindication. The objective of this study is to extend the indications for VAC therapy to include infected wounds by demonstrating its ability to increase the antibiotic concentration in the damaged and infected tissues. Patients who presented with ulcers infected with daptomycin-sensitive bacteria were eligible to be enrolled in this prospective study. They were given antibiotic therapy with daptomycin with a specific protocol. A biopsy of the lesion was carried out to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 0. Afterwards, the patients were subjected to VAC therapy. At the end of VAC therapy, a second lesion biopsy was performed and analysed to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 1. A control group was enrolled in which patients followed the same protocol, but they were treated with traditional dressings. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the two groups. The results highlighted a significant increase in the concentration of antibiotics in the study group tissue; the improvement was sensibly lower in the control group. Statistical differences were not found between the two groups. The preliminary analysis of the data showed an important increase of antibiotic concentration in the tissue after VAC therapy. Despite the encouraging data, it is necessary to broaden the sample of patients and perform the same study with other antibiotics.

AB  - Background The incidence of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection has increased in recent decades because of widespread use of immunosuppressive therapy and better detection methods. The histopathology of cutaneous NTM infection is not pathognomic and the organisms are slow and difficult to culture, making diagnosis challenging. Methods We reviewed the clinical and histopathological features of 13 cases of cutaneous NTM infection, and performed panmycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the paraffin blocks. Results The immunocompetent patients presented with localized lesions on the extremities, whereas the immunocompromised patients presented with disseminated cutaneous lesions. The histopathology in immunocompetent patients was characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, intraepithelial abscesses, transepidermal elimination and dermal granulomatous inflammation accompanied by necrosis and suppuration. The immunocompromised patients showed suppurative inflammation with little granuloma formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli. Paraffin block PCR was positive in 4 of 13 cases (31%), whereas culture was positive in 11 of 13 cases (85%). Conclusion The aforementioned histological features should help in diagnosing cutaneous NTM infection when combined with clinical and microbiological correlation. In our study, we did not find paraffin block PCR to be superior to conventional culture in detecting cutaneous NTM infection.

AB  - Abstract??? The possible relation between treatment delay and healing complications in mandibular fracture treatment (excluding condylar fractures) was reviewed systematically. Twenty-two studies were identified. No randomized studies focused on the effect of immediate or delayed treatment. The main focus of most studies was surgical repositioning and internal skeletal fixation. The healing complications analyzed in this study were infection in the fracture line and malocclusion. Statistical analysis of the influence of treatment delay upon healing complications was possible in six studies. Four studies showed no significant difference between immediate and delayed treatment. One study showed a preference for healing for cases treated within 3?days, whereas another study indicated that treatment time between 3 and 5?days were optimal with the lowest rate of complications. Finally, a few studies identified confounding factors such as alcohol, drug abuse and/or non-compliance, factors which have been shown strongly to influence the likelihood of complications. A significant problem in this analysis was that rather few patients were actually treated on an acute basis (i.e. within 12 or 24?hours after injury), a fact which together with the lack of control of confounding factors made this analysis problematic. In conclusion, there is presently no strong evidence for either acute or delayed treatment of mandibular fractures in order to minimize healing complications; new studies including a substantial number of cases treated on an acute basis are very much needed.
