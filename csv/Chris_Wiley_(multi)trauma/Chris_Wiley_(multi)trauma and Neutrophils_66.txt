AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20 years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.

AB  - Summary Background Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) are life-threatening infections most commonly diagnosed in acute leukaemia patients with prolonged neutropenia and are uncommonly diagnosed in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. Objectives Following the initial report of aspergillosis diagnosed shortly after beginning ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a survey was developed to seek additional cases of IFD during ibrutinib treatment. Methods Local and international physicians and groups were approached for relevant cases. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma; proven or probable IFD; and ibrutinib treatment on the date IFD were diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data were captured using REDCap software. Result Thirty-five patients with IFD were reported from 22 centres in eight countries: 26 (74%) had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment before the onset of IFD was 45 days (range 1-540). Aspergillus species were identified in 22 (63%) of the patients and Cryptococcus species in 9 (26%). Pulmonary involvement occurred in 69% of patients, cranial in 60% and disseminated disease in 60%. A definite diagnosis was made in 21 patients (69%), and the mortality rate was 69%. Data from Israel regarding ibrutinib treated patients were used to evaluate a prevalence of 2.4% IFD. Conclusions The prevalence of IFD among chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with ibrutinib appears to be higher than expected. These patients often present with unusual clinical features. Mortality from IFD in this study was high, indicating that additional studies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk for ibrutinib-associated IFD.

AB  - Abstract In this study, a novel antibiotic carrier system for use in the treatment of implant-related and chronic osteomyelitis was developed. Sulbactam-cefoperazone was introduced to rods of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate (22 mol % HV, w/w), a member of a family of microbial-origin polymer that is biodegradable, biocompatible, and osteoconductive due to its piezoelectric property. The antibiotic-loaded carrier was implanted into the infection site that was induced by Staphylococcus aureus inoculation into the rabbit tibia. The effectiveness of this was assessed macroscopically, radiographically, bacteriologically, and histopathologically. Findings of infection subsided on day 15 and almost complete remission was observed on day 30. The control side that contained antibiotic-free rods, however, worsened. These findings prompted us to conclude that the novel biodegradable antibiotic carrier developed in the present study seems to be a promising candidate for use in the treatment of severe bone infection. ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Correlate the necropsy diagnosis with the history, diagnostic findings, and clinical course of dyspneic cats with primary lung parenchymal disease. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Animals: Client-owned cats over 6 months of age hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a primary problem of respiratory distress that had pulmonary parenchymal disease on thoracic radiographs, and a complete necropsy. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Cats included were assigned into 2 groups based on the pulmonary histopathology: inflammatory (n=8) and neoplastic (n=7) disease. No statistical difference was found between the groups with regard to age, body weight, clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, physical examination findings, thoracic radiography, duration of hospitalization, treatment, and outcome. Cats with neoplasia had a statistically higher mean total white blood cell count (26.60?k/?L±10.41) than those with inflammatory lung disease (11.59?k/?L±4.49; P=0.026). Cats with bacterial or viral pulmonary disease had a significantly shorter median duration of illness (5 days, range 1?7 days) than all other cats (30 days, range 7?365 days; P=0.0042). Ultrasound guided pulmonary fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provided an accurate diagnosis in 5/5 cases. Conclusions: Forty-seven percent of cats with pulmonary parenchymal disease had neoplasia. The clinical diagnosis was difficult to obtain ante-mortem; lung FNA appeared to be the most helpful diagnostic tool in these cases.

AB  - Summary Odontogenic cysts occur in tooth-bearing regions of the jaw and are lined by odontogenic epithelium, including residual dental lamina, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the epithelial root sheath. This chapter discusses the specific types of odontogenic cysts. It also discusses specific radiologic features as they pertain to a particular type of odontogenic cyst. Histopathologic examination plays a critical role in the diagnosis of odontogenic cysts. When sampled with the cyst lining as part of a biopsy sample, bone within the cyst wall is usually mildly proliferative, organized woven bone. The pathogenesis is initiated by endodontic disease, which is followed by inflammation at the root apex, bone loss, proliferation of residual epithelium, and fluid transport into the lumen of an epithelium-lined cavity. The risk of tumor development within odontogenic cysts is regularly referenced in both the human and veterinary literature on odontogenic cysts.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To alert emergency veterinarians of a life-threatening soft tissue infection, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) that mimics non life-threatening cellulitis. In this report, the rapid clinical progression, systemic effects produced by NF, and its successful treatment in a dog is described. Case Summary: A 2-year-old, male, castrated Doberman Pinscher was presented for lameness. Clinical and laboratory findings suggested sepsis. Rapid progression of the infection, as well as surgical and histopathological findings were characteristic for necrotizing fasciitis of a pelvic limb caused by ?-hemolytic streptococcus infection. Aggressive supportive care included intravascular fluid therapy, intravenous antibiotics, plasma transfusions, nutritional support, as well as repeated surgical debridement and drainage. Mid-femoral limb amputation was required to halt the progression of the necrotizing fasciitis. New Information Provided: This is the first detailed description of successful treatment of necrotizing fasciitis caused by ?-Hemolytic streptococcus in the dog.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.
