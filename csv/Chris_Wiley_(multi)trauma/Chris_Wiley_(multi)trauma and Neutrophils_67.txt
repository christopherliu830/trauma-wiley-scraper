AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are at an increased risk of stroke, sudden death and venous thromboembolism, which are all linked to thrombus formation (thrombogenesis). The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.

AB  - Abstract Neuronal survival depends on multiple factors that comprise a well-fueled energy metabolism, trophic input, clearance of toxic substances, appropriate redox environment, integrity of blood?brain barrier, suppression of programmed cell death pathways and cell cycle arrest. Disturbances of brain homeostasis lead to acute or chronic alterations that might ultimately cause neuronal death with consequent impairment of neurological function. Although we understand most of these processes well when they occur independently from one another, we still lack a clear grasp of the concerted cellular and molecular mechanisms activated upon neuronal damage that intervene in protecting damaged neurons from death. In this review, we summarize a handful of endogenously activated mechanisms that balance molecular cues so as to determine whether neurons recover from injury or die. We center our discussion on mechanisms that have been identified to participate in stroke, although we consider different scenarios of chronic neurodegeneration as well. We discuss two central processes that are involved in endogenous repair and that, when not regulated, could lead to tissue damage, namely, trophic support and neuroinflammation. We emphasize the need to construct integrated models of neuronal degeneration and survival that, in the end, converge in neuronal fate after injury. Under neurodegenerative conditions, endogenously activated mechanisms balance out molecular cues that determine whether neurons contend toxicity or die. Many processes involved in endogenous repair may as well lead to tissue damage depending on the strength of stimuli. Signaling mediated by trophic factors and neuroinflammation are examples of these processes as they regulate different mechanisms that mediate neuronal demise including necrosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and autophagy. In this review, we discuss recent findings on balanced regulation and their involvement in neuronal death.

AB  - Abstract Wound healing is an inherent response resulting in the restoration of tissue integrity. It is a complex process involving cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The dermal tissue is an important component of skin that acts as a connecting link between the epidermis and hypodermis. The appearance of scars and contractures after autologous split-thickness skin transplantation or single epidermis diaphragm transplantation for full skin defects indicates that the dermal tissue plays an important role in skin regeneration. Theoretically, dermis cannot regenerate like the liver, bone and epidermis after being destroyed by burns or avulsion. Scarring is hard to avoid during the process of natural healing. However, if the dermis could be reconstructed perfectly, this would be a breakthrough in the methods used for wound healing. In this review, we summarize recent research about dermal regeneration and discuss the probability of advances in the field. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.
