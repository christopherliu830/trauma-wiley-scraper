AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) often leads to high mortality, and there is as yet no effective drug treatment. The present study aimed to investigate protective effects of mogroside IIIE (MGIIIE, a cucurbitane-type triterpenoid from Siraitia grosvenorii Fruits) in experimental ALI and its underlying mechanism. MGIIIE (1, 10 0r 20 mg/kg) was orally administered for 1 h before a single intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg). MGIIIE treatment dose-dependently suppressed pulmonary oedema, pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α and HMGB1) release and higher MPO activity in lung tissues induced by LPS challenge. Molecular researches showed that mogroside IIIE (20 mg/kg) not only increased the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but suppressed the over-expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). In addition, MGIIIE also inhibited the activation of MAPKs and nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) signalling in lung tissues from LPS-challenged mice. Similar antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE were obtained in LPS-treated macrophages. Compound C (a pharmacological AMPK inhibitor) obviously reversed the antiinflammatory effect of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI mice. Taken together, AMPK activation plays a crucial role in the antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI by down-regulating TLR4/MAPK/NF-?B signalling pathways.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - We analysed cytomorphological characteristics of three fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples of acral myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (AMIFS) as well as the features of a number of other benign and malignant myxoid lesions. The analysis showed that FNAB samples from two cases of AMIFS had similar cytomorphology, containing all the characteristic features described in surgical biopsies: myxoid material, spindle cells with bipolar cytoplasmic extensions, epithelioid cells with globules of extra-cellular material, ganglion-like and lipoblast-like giant cells. Only the inflammatory component was scarce. The third sample did not contain features typical of AMIFS. Samples from other myxoid tumours resembled AMIFS to some extent, however, none of them contained all three tumour components characteristic of AMIFS. Cytomorphology of AMIFS may be characteristic enough to enable a definitive diagnosis from FNAB, provided all the distinctive features are sampled.

AB  - Summary Analysis of the bone marrow remains a basic tool in the evaluation of patients with hematopoeitic disorders. This chapter reviews the marrow biopsy procedure and the normal morphologic features of the marrow as well as outlining practical features in the evaluation the marrow aspirate smear and core biopsy. Ancillary diagnostic tests such as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic studies important for defining the nature of marrow disorders are also discussed. The chapter should give the student a fundamental understanding of the bone marrow biopsy procedure and testing methods.
