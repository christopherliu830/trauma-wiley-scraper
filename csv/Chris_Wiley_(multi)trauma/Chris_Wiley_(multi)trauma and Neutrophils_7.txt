AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - SUMMARY Aims? Foot infections and the subsequent amputation of a lower extremity are the most common cause of hospitalization among patients with diabetes mellitus. Although there are several reasons for susceptibility to infection in diabetic patients, white blood cell dysfunction is considered to be an important cause for this tendency. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow and improves neutrophil functions. Based on this knowledge, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of addition of G-CSF to the treatment of foot infections in diabetic patients. Methods? Thirty diabetic patients with foot infection were included in the study. Fifteen of the patients received standard treatment consisting of local wound care and antibiotics (standard goup), and the other 15 patients received G-CSF besides standard treatment (G-CSF group). The objectives of this study were to determine the time to resolution of infection, time to hospital discharge, need for surgical intervention, and the effects of G-CSF on phagocytosis and respiratory burst of neutrophils. Results? Treatment with G-CSF led to significantly higher neutrophil counts on the 5th and 10th days, and at the end of treatment in the G-CSF treated group compared to the standard group. Respiratory burst of neutrophils increased significantly in both the G-CSF group (from 1.6?±?0.3 to 2.3?±?0.5, p =?0.001) and the standard group (from 2.0?±?0.4 to 2.3?±?0.4, p =?0.02) with treatment. But, while phagocytosis of neutrophils increased significantly in the G-CSF group (from 70.4?±?2.0 to 74.5?±?1.9, p =?0.004), it did not change significantly in the standard group (from 68.1?±?0.2 to 69.4?±?1.9, p =?0.3) with treatment. Duration of hospitalization (26.9?±?2.0 vs. 28.3?days, p <?0.05), duration of parenteral antibiotic administration (22.9?±?2.0 vs. 23.3?±?1.9?days, p <?0.05), time to resolution of infection (23.6?±?1.8 vs. 22.3?±?1.7?days, p <?0.05), and need for amputation (13.3% vs. 20%, p >?0.05) were similar between the G-CSF and the standard groups. Conclusions? Although G-CSF improves neutrophil function as well as increasing the absolute numbers, this improvement is not associated with shortening of duration of antibiotic administration, duration of hospital stay or need for amputation in diabetic foot infection.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Summary The intestine may be subjected to simple obstruction, in which only the lumen is obstructed, strangulating obstruction, in which both the lumen and vasculature are obstructed, or infarction, in which only the vasculature is obstructed. Each of these may injure intestinal tissues, particularly with interruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemic injury. This can also occur in simple obstruction as the luminal pressure causes collapse of the vasculature within the intestinal wall. Once reperfused, ischemic-injured mucosa may undergo reperfusion injury, depending on the circumstances. This relates to the level of reactive oxygen metabolite generation and infiltration of neutrophils. More recently, repair of the mucosa has been studied in depth, including villus contraction (in the small intestine), epithelial restitution, tight junction closure, and mucosal proliferation. Other layers of the intestine are also injured, particularly the serosa, which can lead to inflammation and development of adhesions.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. We hypothesized that Lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. The objective was to investigate the effect of Lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. Methods:? Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. Glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3?ml/min) with and without Lf (100??g/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3?h, 37°C). Attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (107?colony-forming units/ml) with Lf-coated (20?100??g/ml) and uncoated glass slides. The effects of ?-lactoglobulin, 2,2?-dipyridyl (25?100??g/ml), an iron chelator, and FeCl3 on attachment were also examined. Results:? Lf inhibited the initial attachment of S. gordonii (50.3%, P?<?0.05) but not that of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. However, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing S. gordonii (i.e. S. gordonii/F. nucleatum or S. gordonii/P. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, P?<?0.05) in the presence of Lf. ?-Lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of S. gordonii. In the presence of 100??m 2,2?-dipyridyl, attachment of S. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. No reduction in attachment was noted in S. gordonii pretreated with Lf (100??g/ml) and FeCl3 (20?200??m). Conclusion:? Lf suppresses initial attachment of S. gordonii and S. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. This may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Summary The practice of war surgery has a longstanding relationship with the speciality of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The relationship has often fostered new and often ground-breaking developments in medicine and surgery. The last decade of conflict has been no different. Understanding the history and principles of war surgery is paramount to its practice. This chapter aims to distil the salient practices learnt from recent conflicts through understanding of what wounds soldiers at war and the compounding factors that make surgery more arduous in war conditions. Furthermore, the chapter will give a concise understanding of blast and penetrating injury and develop this in the methods of applying plastic and reconstructive surgery military surgical teams.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hypocobalaminaemia in cats with moderate to severe hyperthyroidism and to investigate the relationship between cobalamin status and selected haematologic parameters. Methods: Serum cobalamin concentrations were measured in 76 spontaneously hyperthyroid cats [serum thyroxine (T4) concentration ≥100 nmol/L] and 100 geriatric euthyroid cats. Erythrocyte and neutrophil counts in hyperthyroid cats with hypocobalaminaemia were compared with those in hyperthyroid cats with adequate serum cobalamin concentrations (≥290 ng/L). Results: The median cobalamin concentration in hyperthyroid cats was lower than the control group (409 versus 672 ng/L; P=0·0040). In addition, 40·8% of hyperthyroid cats had subnormal serum cobalamin concentrations compared with 25% of controls (P=0·0336). Weak negative correlation (coefficient: ?0·3281) was demonstrated between serum cobalamin and T4 concentrations in the hyperthyroid population, and the median cobalamin concentration was lower in cats with T4 above the median of 153 nmol/L compared with cats with T4 below this value (P=0·0281). Hypocobalaminaemia was not associated with neutropenia or anaemia in hyperthyroid cats. Clinical Significance: This study indicates that a substantial proportion of cats with T4≥100 nmol/L are hypocobalaminaemic and suggests that hyperthyroidism directly or indirectly affects cobalamin uptake, excretion or utilisation in this species.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Ex vivo evidence suggests that cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 2-preferential inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as meloxicam, have a less detrimental effect on intestinal healing than flunixin meglumine (FM). Whether this translates to a beneficial effect in horses with naturally occurring strangulating small intestinal (SSI) lesions is unknown. Objectives To compare the clinical outcome of horses with naturally occurring SSI lesions treated with meloxicam or FM. Study design Randomised prospective study. Methods Cases presenting to the Royal Veterinary College Equine Referral Hospital and Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic during 2010 and 2011 in which an SSI lesion was identified at exploratory laparotomy were eligible for inclusion. Horses received either 1.1?mg/kg bwt FM or 0.6?mg/kg bwt meloxicam i.v. q. 12?h. Clinical outcomes and clinical and laboratory parameters associated with endotoxaemia were compared between groups. Results Sixty cases were enrolled, 32 horses received FM and 28 received meloxicam. There was no difference in signalment, physical examination or surgical factors between groups. The overall survival to discharge was 81%; there was no difference in survival (P = 0.14) or incidence of post operative ileus (P = 0.25) between groups. There was no significant difference between the plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations at 0?h (P = 0.18) or 48?h (P = 0.60); however, there was a significant difference between neutrophil count at 48?h (P<0.05) and at 96?h (P<0.01) with significantly greater cell numbers in horses receiving meloxicam compared with FM. Blinded pain score evaluation showed that more horses receiving meloxicam showed gross signs of pain than those treated with FM (P = 0.04). Conclusions Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug choice did not affect major clinical outcomes in horses with SSI lesions but had some effects on signs of pain. This study provides no evidence to recommend one NSAID treatment above another based on survival or the incidence of ileus; however, evaluation of a larger number of cases is required.

AB  - Background Interdigital pyoderma is a common multifactorial, inflammatory disease of the canine interdigital skin. Lesions commonly become infected secondarily. In addition to management of the underlying cause, management of the chronic inflammatory changes in the interdigital skin created by secondary infection and by the release of keratin into deep tissues is required. Fluorescence biomodulation appears to modulate the inflammatory process in dermatological disorders and has shown promise in preliminary studies evaluating its use in superficial and deep pyoderma in dogs. Hypothesis/Objectives To evaluate the effect of a fluorescence biomodulation (FB) system used in conjunction with systemic antibiotic on clinical manifestations of canine interdigital pyoderma (CIP), compared to dogs treated with antibiotic alone. Animals Thirty-six dogs diagnosed with CIP. Methods and materials Dogs were randomly allocated to treatment groups of either antibiotic alone (Group A) or antibiotic plus twice-weekly FB application (Group B). Dogs were scored over a 12 week period on the basis of two measured parameters: a global lesion score composed of four different lesions types and neutrophil engulfing bacterial scores. Results A statistically significant decrease was seen by Week 3 in both measured parameters for Group B compared to Group A. The mean time-to-resolution of lesions was 4.3 weeks in Group B and 10.4 weeks in Group A. Conclusion and clinical importance The FB system shows promise as an adjunct therapy to systemic antibiotic use in the management of CIP.

AB  - BACKGROUND Implications from the pragmatic, randomize, optimal platelet and plasma ratios (PROPPR) trial are critical for remote damage control resuscitation (DCR). Utilizing DCR principals in remote settings can combat early mortality from hemorrhage. Identifying the appropriate transfusion strategy is mandatory prior to adopting prehospital hemostatic resuscitation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The PROPPR study was examined in relation to the following questions: 1) Why is it important to have blood products in the prehospital setting?; 2) Which products should be investigated for prehospital hemostatic resuscitation?; 3) What is the appropriate ratio of blood product transfusion?; and 4) What are the appropriate indications for hemostatic resuscitation? RESULTS PROPPR demonstrates that early and balanced blood product transfusion ratios reduced mortality in all patients at 3 hours and death from exsanguination at 24 hours (p?=?0.03). The median time to death from exsanguination was 2.3 hours, highlighting the need for point-of-injury DCR capabilities. A 1:1:1 transfusion ratio of plasma:platelets:packed red blood cells increased the percentage of patients achieving anatomic hemostasis (p?=?0.006). PROPPR used the assessment of blood consumption score to identify patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. The critical administration threshold predicted patient mortality and identified patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. CONCLUSION A balanced resuscitation strategy demonstrates an early survival benefit, decreased death from exsanguination at 24 hours and a greater likelihood of achieving hemostasis in critically injured patients receiving a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:PRBCs. This finding highlights the need to import DCR principals to remote locations.

AB  - Abstract We investigated mechanisms by which a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the CD11d subunit of the leukocyte integrin CD11d/CD18 improves neurological recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in the rat. The effects of an anti-CD11d mAb treatment were assessed on ED-1 expression (estimating macrophage infiltration), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO, approximating neutrophil infiltration), lipid peroxidation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine (indicating protein nitration) expression in the spinal cord lesion after severe clip-compression injury. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) production. After anti-CD11d mAb treatment, decreased ED-1 expression at 6?72?h after SCI indicated reduced macrophage infiltration. MPO activity (units/g tissue) was reduced significantly from 114?±?11 to 75?± 8 (??34%) at 6?h and from 38?± 2 to 22?± 4 (??42%) at 72?h. After SCI, anti-CD11d mAb treatment significantly reduced TBARS from 501?±?61 to 296?±?17?nm (??41%) at 6?h and to approximately uninjured values (87?nm) at 72?h. The mAb treatment also attenuated the expression of iNOS and formation of nitrotyrosine at 6?72?h after SCI. These data indicate that anti-CD11d mAb treatment blocks intraspinal neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, reducing the intraspinal concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These effects likely underlie improved tissue preservation and neurological function resulting from the mAb treatment.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness is an aetiologically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome that is characterised by organ failure and immune dysfunction. Mortality in critically ill patients is driven by inflammation-associated organ damage and a profound vulnerability to nosocomial infection. Both factors are influenced by the activated complement protein C5a, released by unbridled activation of the complement system during critical illness. C5a exerts deleterious effects on organ systems directly and suppresses antimicrobial functions of key immune cells. Whilst several recent reports have added key knowledge of the cellular signalling pathways triggered by C5a, there remain a number of areas that are incompletely understood and therapeutic opportunities are still being evaluated. In this review, we summarise the cellular basis for C5a-induced vulnerability to nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction. We focus on cells of the innate immune system, highlighting the major areas in need of further research and potential avenues for targeted therapies.

AB  - Biofilm infections are one of the modern medical world's greatest challenges. Probably, all non-obligate intracellular bacteria and fungi can establish biofilms. In addition, there are numerous biofilm-related infections, both foreign body-related and non-foreign body-related. Although biofilm infections can present in numerous ways, one common feature is involvement of the host response with significant impact on the course. A special characteristic is the synergy of the innate and the acquired immune responses for the induced pathology. Here, we review the impact of the host response for the course of biofilm infections, with special focus on cystic fibrosis, chronic wounds and infective endocarditis.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) tissues, including the brain, the eye, and the spinal cord, are immune-privileged, secluded from the circulation by a complex of barriers, and equipped with their own myeloid cell population, the resident microglia. Based on the classical perspective of immune?brain interactions and on the contribution of such interactions to the progression of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS, infiltrating macrophages were traditionally viewed as an enemy of the nervous system. However, over the past two decades, research has revealed the pivotal role of monocyte-derived macrophages in CNS repair, and opened up a new era in understanding and treating CNS pathologies. Here, we gather current knowledge regarding macrophage broad spectrum of activities in the CNS, whose two poles correspond to the classical pro-inflammatory M1 and the ?alternatively-activated? M2 cells previously described in various non-CNS pathologies, and their diverse, multi-functional contribution in various neurological conditions, ranging from acute traumas to neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The diverse functions are manifested by induction and resolution of inflammation as well as their involvement in neural tissue regeneration and renewal, matrix remodelling, debris clearance, and angiogenesis. A special focus is devoted to current evidence suggesting that resident microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are functionally non-redundant cell types. Taken together, these recent advances reveal a dramatic therapeutic opportunity for controlled harnessing of macrophages for repair of the damaged CNS following acute insults, in neurodegenerative conditions, and in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.
