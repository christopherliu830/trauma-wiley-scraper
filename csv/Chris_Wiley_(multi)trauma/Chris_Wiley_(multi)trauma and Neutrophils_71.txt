AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to investigate whether luminal perfusion with glutamine or with oxygenated glutamine solutions prevents endotoxin-induced changes in mucosal permeability. Methods: Three 15-cm segments of distal ileum were isolated in anesthetized 21-day-old piglets (n = 4) and perfused (50 mL/h) with Ringer's lactate solution, Ringer's lactate solution with 2% glutamine (wt/vol), glutamine, or glutamine purged with oxygen at 37°C for 280 minutes. Plasma-to-lumen clearances of 51Cr-EDTA and urea were measured to assess mucosal permeability. At time 0 minutes, loading and maintenance IV infusions of markers were begun. Baseline permeabilities were obtained from time 60 to 80 minutes, and IV endotoxin (50 ?g/kg) was introduced from time 80 to 140 minutes. Results: Results are expressed as the ratio of the clearances of the two probes (CEDTA/CUREA). Permeability increased from baseline in loops perfused with Ringer's lactate solution vs loops perfused with glutamine purged with oxygen and with glutamine alone (p <.01). Saturation with oxygen was without effect inasmuch as glutamine alone negated permeability increases. Intestinal myeloperoxidase activity did not differ with perfusate (p >.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that endotoxin-induced permeability changes can be prevented or delayed by the supply of luminal glutamine at the time of insult.

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.

AB  - The use of herbal medicines dates back a long way in history. Herbal medicines have been widely used all over the world since ancient times and have been recognized by physicians and patients for their good therapeutic value as they have fewer adverse effects than modern medicines. Recently, researchers have used gold nanoparticles synthesized by plants in the prevention, control, and treatment of infectious disorders and cutaneous wounds. The aims of this study were to synthesize gold nanoparticles from aqueous extract of Allium saralicum R.M. Fritsch (AuNPs) and assess their therapeutic capacities. The nanoparticles were characterized by UV?visible spectroscopy (UV?Vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FT-IR results offered polysaccharides and protein in A. saralicum were the sources of reducing power, reducing gold ions to AuNPs. According to XRD analysis, the crystal size of the nanoparticles was 41.6 nm. TEM and FE-SEM images exhibited average diameters of 45 nm for the biosynthesized nanoparticles. The synthesized AuNPs had great cell viability on HUVECs line and showed this method was nontoxic. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging test indicated similar antioxidant potentials for A. saralicum, AuNPs, and butylated hydroxytoluene. To determine the antifungal and antibacterial properties of HAuCl4, A. saralicum, and AuNPs, agar diffusion tests were used. The aim of the application both HAuCl4 and A. saralicum in microbial tests was to investigate the synergism effects between them. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were specified by macro-broth dilution assay. AuNPs exhibited higher antifungal and antibacterial effects than all standard antibiotics (p ≤ 0.01). The MIC and MBC of AuNPs against all bacteria were in the ranges 1?4 mg/ml and 2?8 mg/ml, respectively. The MIC and MFC of AuNPs against all fungi were in the ranges 1?4 mg/ml and 2?4 mg/ml, respectively. In vivo part, AuNPs ointment group raised significantly (p ≤ 0.01) the wound contracture, vessel, hydroxyl proline, hexuronic acid, fibrocyte, fibroblast, and fibrocytes/fibroblast rate and decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.01) the wound area, total cells, and lymphocyte compared to other groups in rats. The results of FT-IR, UV?Vis, XRD, TEM, and FE-SEM analyses confirm that the aqueous extract of A. saralicum leaves can be used to yield gold nanoparticles with a notable amount of remedial effects without any cytotoxicity against HUVECs.

AB  - Summary Necrotising fasciitis is a rare, life-threatening, soft-tissue infection characterised by rapidly spreading inflammation and subsequent necrosis of the muscle, fascia and surrounding tissues. We report a case of necrotising fasciitis originating from the shoulder in a 59-year-old female patient. Necrotising fasciitis of the shoulder is very rare and has a poor prognosis because of its potential to spread to the chest wall. It can occur in otherwise healthy people without any predisposing conditions and could present as muscle strain. Disproportionate pain is the hallmark of this condition. Ultrasound examination and aspiration of fluid from the involved area is a fast and efficient method of reaching the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was originally defined as a ubiquitous nuclear protein, but it was later determined that the protein has different roles both inside and outside of cells. Nuclear HMGB1 regulates chromatin structure and gene transcription, whereas cytosolic HMGB1 is involved in inflammasome activation and autophagy. Extracellular HMGB1 has drawn attention because it can bind to related cell signalling transduction receptors, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products, Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4 and TLR9. It also participates in the development and progression of a variety of diseases. HMGB1 is actively secreted by stimulation of the innate immune system, and it is passively released by ischaemia or cell injury. This review focuses on the important role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic sterile inflammatory conditions. Strategies that target HMGB1 have been shown to significantly decrease inflammation in several disease models of sterile inflammation, and this may represent a promising clinical approach for treatment of certain conditions associated with sterile inflammation.
