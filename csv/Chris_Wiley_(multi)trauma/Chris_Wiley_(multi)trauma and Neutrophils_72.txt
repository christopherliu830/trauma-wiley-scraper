AB  - Summary Alopecia may occur anywhere on the body of guinea pigs. Skin scrapings, biopsies, histopathology, special histologic staining, and fungal or microbiologic culturing are all suitable ancillary techniques for determining an etiologic basis for suspected infectious causes of alopecia in guinea pigs. Animal housing and management practices should be evaluated closely in simple cases of alopecia, looking for potential sources of abrasions or rough surfaces in which hair may be caught. Adequacy of diet should be ascertained, particularly with respect to vitamin C content. There are few published reports of neurologic disorders in guinea pigs. Head tilt, circling, and head shaking may be seen with bacterial infections of the middle and inner ear. Cataracts with or without nuclear sclerosis are common findings in guinea pigs and may invol.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary A single determinant factor for autoimmunity does not exist; disease development probably involves contributions from genetics, the environment and immune dysfunction. Type 1 diabetes is no exception. Genomewide-associated studies (GWAS) analysis in T1D has proved disappointing in revealing contributors to disease prediction; the only reliable marker has been human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Specific HLAs include DR3/DR4/DQ2/DQ8, for example. Because HLA molecules present antigen to T cells, it is reasonable that certain HLA molecules have a higher affinity to present self-antigen. Recent studies have shown that additional polymorphisms in HLA that are restricted to autoimmune conditions are further contributory. A caveat is that not all individuals with the appropriate ?pro-autoimmune? HLA develop an autoimmune disease. Another crucial component is autoaggressive T cells. Finding a biomarker to discriminate autoaggressive T cells has been elusive. However, a subset of CD4 helper cells that express the CD40 receptor have been described as becoming pathogenic. An interesting function of CD40 on T cells is to induce the recombination-activating gene (RAG)1/RAG2 T cell receptor recombination machinery. This observation is contrary to immunology paradigms that changes in TCR molecules cannot take place outside the thymic microenvironment. Alteration in TCR, called TCR revision, not only occurs, but may help to account for the development of autoaggressive T cells. Another interesting facet is that type 1 diabetes (T1D) may be more than a single disease; that is, multiple cellular components contribute uniquely, but result ultimately in the same clinical outcome, T1D. This review considers the process of T cell maturation and how that could favor auto-aggressive T cell development in T1D. The potential contribution of TCR revision to autoimmunity is also considered.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses strategies for autologous transfusion, various blood-derived biologicals, non-blood-derived drugs and strategies to prevent haemorrhage and manage haemostatic disorders. The criteria for accepting donors for autologous transfusion need not be as strict as those for allogeneic transfusion. Preoperative assessment can identify anemia with correctable cause and contribute to avoidance of allogeneic transfusion. The major cause of anaemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is a lack of production of erythropoietin. The major side-effects of treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) are hypertension and thrombotic episodes, originally thought to be related primarily to excessive doses and too rapid correction of anaemia. Anaphylaxis, the major toxicity associated with vitamin K, is rare, but dramatic. Thrombin is a potent plasma-derived enzyme that is formed from prothrombin as a result of activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.

AB  - Surgically accessing pathological lesions located within the central nervous system (CNS) frequently requires creating an incision in cosmetic regions of the head and neck. The biggest factors of surgical success typically tend to focus on the middle portion of the surgery, but a vast majority of surgical complications tend to happen towards the end of a case, during closure of the surgical site incisions. One of the most difficult complications for a surgeon to deal with is having to take a patient back to the operating room for wound breakdowns and, even worse, wound or CNS infections, which can negate all the positive outcomes from the surgery itself. In this paper, we discuss the underlying anatomy, pharmacological considerations, surgical techniques and nutritional needs necessary to help facilitate appropriate wound healing. A successful surgery begins with preoperative planning regarding the placement of the surgical incision, being cognizant of cosmetics, and the effects of possible adjuvant radiation therapy on healing incisions. We need to assess patient's medications and past medical history to make sure we can optimise conditions for proper wound reepithelialisation, such as minimizing the amount of steroids and certain antibiotics. Contrary to harmful medications, it is imperative to optimise nutritional intake with adequate supplementation and vitamin intake. The goals of this paper are to reinforce the mechanisms by which surgical wounds can fail, leading to postoperative complications, and to provide surgeons with the reminder and techniques that can help foster a more successful surgical outcome.
