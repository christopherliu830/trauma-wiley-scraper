AB  - Surgically accessing pathological lesions located within the central nervous system (CNS) frequently requires creating an incision in cosmetic regions of the head and neck. The biggest factors of surgical success typically tend to focus on the middle portion of the surgery, but a vast majority of surgical complications tend to happen towards the end of a case, during closure of the surgical site incisions. One of the most difficult complications for a surgeon to deal with is having to take a patient back to the operating room for wound breakdowns and, even worse, wound or CNS infections, which can negate all the positive outcomes from the surgery itself. In this paper, we discuss the underlying anatomy, pharmacological considerations, surgical techniques and nutritional needs necessary to help facilitate appropriate wound healing. A successful surgery begins with preoperative planning regarding the placement of the surgical incision, being cognizant of cosmetics, and the effects of possible adjuvant radiation therapy on healing incisions. We need to assess patient's medications and past medical history to make sure we can optimise conditions for proper wound reepithelialisation, such as minimizing the amount of steroids and certain antibiotics. Contrary to harmful medications, it is imperative to optimise nutritional intake with adequate supplementation and vitamin intake. The goals of this paper are to reinforce the mechanisms by which surgical wounds can fail, leading to postoperative complications, and to provide surgeons with the reminder and techniques that can help foster a more successful surgical outcome.

AB  - Summary Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of several infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first-line immunosuppressive drugs used for controlling neuroinflammation. A delayed diffusion of GCs molecules and the high systemic doses required for brain-specific targeting lead to severe undesirable effects, particularly when lifelong treatment is required. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improving this current therapeutic approach. The intranasal (i.n.) route is being employed increasingly for drug delivery to the brain via the olfactory system. In this study, the i.n. route is compared to the intravenous (i.v.) administration of GCs with respect to their effectiveness in controlling neuroinflammation induced experimentally by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. A statistically significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the central nervous system (CNS) in the percentage of CD45+/CD11b+/lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D [Ly6G+ and in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining was observed in mice from the i.n.-dexamethasone (DX] group compared to control and i.v.-DX-treated animals. DX treatment did not modify the percentage of microglia and perivascular macrophages as determined by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunostaining of the cortex and hippocampus. The increased accumulation of DX in brain microvasculature in DX-i.n.-treated mice compared with controls and DX-IV-treated animals may underlie the higher effectiveness in controlling neuroinflammation. Altogether, these results indicate that IN-DX administration may offer a more efficient alternative than systemic administration to control neuroinflammation in different neuropathologies.

AB  - Abstract A novel allergy vaccine (Pollinex? Quattro) has been developed for the prevention or relief of allergic symptoms caused by a variety of pollens. Within this range, the grass pollen allergy vaccine contains extracts of 12 grass pollens and rye cereal (all chemically modi?ed by glutaraldehyde) that are adsorbed onto l-tyrosine with addition of the immunostimulatory adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL?). A speci?c preclinical safety testing strategy was developed to support clinical use, comprising single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies. Dose levels of up to 0.5 ml per animal (mouse) and up to 1.0 ml per animal (rat and rabbit) were used with vaccines containing 2000 or 12 000 standardized units (SU) ml?1 of grass pollen allergoids, 50 µg ml?1 of MPL? adjuvant and 20 mg ml?1 of tyrosine. Overall, the product showed no toxicological ?ndings of signi?cance at levels greatly in excess of those proposed for clinical use. A not unexpected, but relatively minor, immunostimulatory effect was seen following repeated dosing (once weekly for 3 weeks) at 1.0 ml per rat. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary: Background: To evaluate the biocompatibility of surgical mesh, explanted mesh samples were collected and analysed. ?Methods: All mesh specimens (N?= 347) underwent a detailed clinical work-up and morphological study by conventional light microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. ?Results: The mean implantation interval for all mesh samples was approximately 24 months; the reason for explantation in the present data pool included complications such as recurrence (mean 63?%), chronic pain (mean 30?%), infection (mean 21?%) or fistula formation (mean 7?%). All mesh types in this particular database exhibited no significant differences in recurrence rates and infection, but significant differences in chronic pain. Here, the low-weight mesh Vypro? seems to have advantages over heavy-weight mesh modifications. Moreover, histological examination in all specimens revealed a typical foreign body reaction depending on the polymer and the mesh features such as pore size and surface area. ?Conclusions: Hernia repair with surgical mesh may be complicated by recurrence, chronic pain and infection including fistula formation in the long-term follow-up. The main differences between single-mesh modifications were found in chronic pain. Here, low-weight mesh constructions should show improved patient comfort.

AB  - Summary Central nervous system infections are frequently devastating and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Although the brain possesses several defence mechanisms (e.g. intact cranium, blood?brain barrier) to prevent infection, once microorganisms reach the central nervous system, host defence mechanisms are inadequate to control the infection. Antimicrobial therapy is also limited by the poor penetration of many agents into the central nervous system. This chapter reviews meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema, epidural abscess, encephalitis, postpolio syndrome and Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease, stressing recent developments in diagnosis and therapy and the use of adjunctive treatment strategies that have been shown to improve outcome in patients with some of these devastating infections.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Prealbumin levels have been proven to correlate with hospital length of stay, wound healing, infection rates, and mortality in adults hospitalized for medical or surgical purposes, or those who have chronic illnesses. Little is known about the utility of prealbumin evaluation in adults with severe anorexia nervosa (AN). Method We retrospectively evaluated prealbumin levels, along with numerous other clinical parameters relevant to illness acuity and early refeeding outcomes, in 132 adults with AN admitted for definitive inpatient medical stabilization from October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012. Per clinical protocol, prealbumin was checked on admission and approximately weekly thereafter until discharge. Results Patients had a median age of 28 years old, a mean admission body mass index (BMI) of 12.9 kg/m2 (S.D. 6.1), and 89% of patients were women. A total of 47% of patients had a low prealbumin at the time of admission. By discharge, 77% of patients had normalized their prealbumin levels. Patients with low admission prealbumin levels had a threefold increased risk of refeeding hypophosphatemia and a twofold increase in hypoglycemia compared with patients who had a normal admission prealbumin, independent of admission BMI. Discussion A low serum prealbumin level appeared concurrent with other markers of serious medical compromise, and was associated with two potentially life threatening complications of early refeeding: hypophosphatemia and hypoglycemia. The cause of low prealbumin remains elusive. Prealbumin should be checked in patients with severe AN prior to initiating weight restoration, as low levels may be an important harbinger of early refeeding complications. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
