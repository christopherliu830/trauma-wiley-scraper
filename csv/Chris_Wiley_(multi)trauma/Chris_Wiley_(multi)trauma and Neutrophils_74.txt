AB  - Abstract. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe infection characterized by rapidly progressing necrotizing infection of the superficial fascia with secondary necrosis of the overlying skin. Periorbital NF is uncommon because of the excellent blood supply to that area; nevertheless, it can sometimes result in death. The aim of this study is to present a systematic review and analyse the factors associated with death. We carried out a systematic literature review of all cases of periorbital NF published in the English language over the past 20?years and present the predisposing conditions, triggering factors, organisms causing NF, presence or absence of toxic shock and the prognosis. The significance of various risk factors leading to death was analysed. We traced a total of 94 patients with periorbital NF from 61 reports. There were no triggering incidents in 25 cases (26.6%). In 48 cases (51.1%), the organism responsible for NF was Group A beta haemolytic Streptococcus. Toxic shock occurred in 29 (30.9%) cases, and loss of vision in 13 (13.8%). Surgical debridement was carried out in 80 (85.1%) cases. There were eight cases (8.5%) of death. This seems to be less than previously reported figures. Toxic shock syndrome (p?<?0.001), type 1 infections (p?=?0.018), facial involvement (p?=?0.032) and blindness because of periorbital NF (p?=?0.035) were significantly associated with mortality. Mortality caused by NF arising from the periorbital area seems to be on the decline. However, it is important to recognize it early and institute treatment to avoid toxic shock that leads to death. Type 1 infections, although rare in periorbital area, are not associated with immunocompromised status and nevertheless carry a significant risk of mortality. Major morbidity is loss of vision followed by soft-tissue defects affecting function and cosmesis.

AB  - Summary Urine samples were collected from 67 patients attending a Regional Pain Unit for treatment of chronic pain. Patients treated with steroids or with any signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome were excluded. The urine Cortisol/ creatinine ratio was subsequently measured. Values for the urine Cortisol/creatinine ratio were elevated in 31% of the patients, and grossly elevated in some. These patients could not be differentiated from those with normal ratios on the basis of pain or mood scores, cause of pain or drug therapy; they tended to have pain of shorter duration. Possible interpretations of these results are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To investigate bladder tissue reactions to three types of implanted mesh material, i.e. polypropylene, polyglactin and polypropylene-polyglactin combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight adult female Wistar albino rats were randomized to four equal groups, i.e. group 1 (sham-operated controls), group 2 (polypropylene mesh), group 3 (polyglactin mesh) and group 4 (polypropylene-polyglactin mesh). A laparotomy incision was made to access the bladder and fix a 0.5???1?cm piece of mesh directly on the bladder wall. Each group was randomly divided into two subgroups of six animals, killed at 7 and 14?days after mesh implantation, respectively, to study mesh and tissue features with time. Bladders were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical investigation. Microvessels that developed around the mesh were detected with the avidin-biotin peroxidase system, using antibody to Factor VIII-related antigen as an endothelial marker. Vessels were counted in the most intensely stained area of one section from each animal's bladder. RESULTS Compared with the other groups, group 4 had more inflammatory reaction at 7?days but the tissue reactions to all mesh materials were similar at 14?days; the mesh penetrated the bladder muscularis propria at 14 days in all six rats in group 2, in one in group 3, and two in group 4. Group 4 tended to have a greater microvessel density at 14 than at 7 days. In contrast, groups 2 and 3 had lower microvessel densities at 14 than at 7 days. CONCLUSION The rat bladder wall had a similar early response to all three types of mesh materials. Penetration was more marked with polypropylene mesh than with the other materials. This nonabsorbable material persists in tissue and is currently widely used for clinical applications. These results for penetration suggest that the use of polypropylene mesh risks serious postoperative complications, e.g. urethral tissue erosion.

The therapeutic benefits of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the promotion of healing and regeneration of periodontal tissues are thought to result from enrichment in growth factors released from platelets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of specific growth factors released from PRP on endothelial cell proliferation. Material and Methods:? The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor?BB (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in supernatants of calcium- and thrombin-activated PRP samples from five donors were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Supernatants were treated with neutralizing antibodies specific to each growth factor, and the effects of these treatments on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation in vitro were determined. The effect of removing EGF from PRP supernatants with antibody-coated beads on HUVEC proliferation was also tested. Results:? Average concentrations of VEGF, PDGF-BB, bFGF and EGF in PRP supernatants were 189, 27,190, 39.5 and 513?pg/mL, respectively. The addition of EGF neutralizing antibodies to the PRP supernatants significantly reduced HUVEC proliferation (up to 40%), while such an inhibition was not observed following neutralization of the other growth factors. Removal of EGF from PRP supernatants by treatment with antibody-coated beads also resulted in a significant decrease in HUVEC proliferation. Recombinant EGF increased HUVEC proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion:? This study showed that PRP supernatants are highly mitogenic for endothelial cells and provided evidence that this effect may be due, at least in part, to the presence of EGF. In vivo experiments are needed to confirm the roles of specific growth factors released from PRP in the healing of oral surgical and/or periodontal wounds.

AB  - Summary Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and telomere biology disorder characterized by dysplastic nails, reticular skin pigmentation and oral leucoplakia. Androgens are a standard therapeutic option for bone marrow failure in those patients with DC who are unable to undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but there are no systematic data on its use in those patients. We evaluated haematological response and side effects of androgen therapy in 16 patients with DC in our observational cohort study. Untreated DC patients served as controls. Seventy percent of treated DC patients had a haematological response with red blood cell and/or platelet transfusion independence. The expected age-related decline in telomere length was noted in androgen-treated patients. All treated DC patients had at least one significant lipid abnormality. Additional treatment-related findings included a significant decrease in thyroid binding globulin, accelerated growth in pre-pubertal children and splenic peliosis in two patients. Liver enzymes were elevated in both androgen-treated and untreated patients, suggesting underlying liver involvement in DC. This study suggests that androgen therapy can be effectively used to treat bone marrow failure in DC, but that side effects need to be closely monitored.

AB  - Summary Abnormal teeth in young animals may occur for many reasons ? some are genetic but others are acquired. This chapter discusses primary hereditary disorders, spontaneous anomalies of unknown cause, and dental alterations due to extrinsic factors. In addition to clinical information regarding the appearance and condition of the teeth and dental radiographic findings, a thorough evaluation of the history is often required to establish the cause of odontogenic anomalies. The chapter also covers several of the more common equine dental diseases and a few dental pathologies unique to equids. Pulpitis is one of the pathologic processes for which a pathologist may be called upon to examine a tooth histologically. Chronic degenerative changes may occur in injured teeth in the absence of pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Typical inflammatory responses, such as edema and active congestion, may increase pressure within the pulp chamber and thereby exacerbate pulpal injury through ischemia.

AB  - Summary The pericardium provides mechanical protection and assists with normal diastolic coupling of the ventricles. Pericarditis arises from various causes, including infectious and inflammatory diseases. Standard treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and occasionally steroids. Pericardiocentesis is indicated in children with bacterial pericarditis, tamponade physiology, and immunocompromise. Surgical therapy may be indicated in cases of chronic and recurrent effusions, patients with bacterial pericarditis, and patients with constriction. Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization together play a crucial role in the diagnosis and differentiation of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Summary While T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis for more than three decades, the focus on the T helper type 17 (Th17) subset of CD4 T cells and their secreted cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, is much more recent. Proinflammatory actions of IL-17 were first identified in the 1990s, but the delineation of a distinct Th17 subset in late 2005 has sparked great interest in the role of these cells in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. This review summarizes current understanding of the role of Th17 cells and their products in both animal models of inflammatory arthritis and human immune-driven arthritides.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1? (IL-1?) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1? expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 ± 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 ± 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
