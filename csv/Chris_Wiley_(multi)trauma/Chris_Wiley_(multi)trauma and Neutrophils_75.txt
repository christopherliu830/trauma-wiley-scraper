AB  - Summary While interleukin (IL)-1? plays an important role in combating the invading pathogen as part of the innate immune response, its dysregulation is responsible for a number of autoinflammatory disorders. Large IL-1? activating platforms, known as inflammasomes, can assemble in response to the detection of endogenous host and pathogen-associated danger molecules. Formation of these protein complexes results in the autocatalysis and activation of caspase-1, which processes precursor IL-1? into its secreted biologically active form. Inflammasome and IL-1? activity is required to efficiently control viral, bacterial and fungal pathogen infections. Conversely, excess IL-1? activity contributes to human disease, and its inhibition has proved therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of a spectrum of serious, yet relatively rare, heritable inflammasomopathies. Recently, inflammasome function has been implicated in more common human conditions, such as gout, type II diabetes and cancer. This raises the possibility that anti-IL-1 therapeutics may have broader applications than anticipated previously, and may be utilized across diverse disease states that are linked insidiously through unwanted or heightened inflammasome activity.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To describe a severe case of bacterial sepsis and disseminated candidiasis in a previously healthy dog. Case Summary ? Fungal sepsis was identified in a 2-year-old dog following intestinal dehiscence 4 days after abdominal surgery. Septic peritonitis was identified at admission and evidence of dehiscence at the previous enterotomy site was found during an exploratory laparotomy. Both gram-positive cocci and Candida albicans were cultured from the abdominal cavity. Candida sp. was also subsequently cultured from a central venous catheter. Euthanasia was performed due to failure to respond to therapy. Fungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida spp., were found in the lungs and kidney on postmortem histopathologic examination indicating disseminated candidiasis. New or Unique Information Provided ? Candida peritonitis is a well-recognized entity in humans and contributes to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Abdominal surgery, intestinal perforation, presence of central venous catheters, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are all considered to be suspected risk factors. This report describes the first known case of systemic candidiasis occurring secondary to Candida peritonitis and bacterial sepsis in a critically ill dog.

AB  - Summary Abnormal teeth in young animals may occur for many reasons ? some are genetic but others are acquired. This chapter discusses primary hereditary disorders, spontaneous anomalies of unknown cause, and dental alterations due to extrinsic factors. In addition to clinical information regarding the appearance and condition of the teeth and dental radiographic findings, a thorough evaluation of the history is often required to establish the cause of odontogenic anomalies. The chapter also covers several of the more common equine dental diseases and a few dental pathologies unique to equids. Pulpitis is one of the pathologic processes for which a pathologist may be called upon to examine a tooth histologically. Chronic degenerative changes may occur in injured teeth in the absence of pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Typical inflammatory responses, such as edema and active congestion, may increase pressure within the pulp chamber and thereby exacerbate pulpal injury through ischemia.

AB  - Abstract Hyperosmotic stress initiates a variety of compensatory and adaptive responses, which either serve to restore near-normal volume or remodel and reinforce the cell structure to withstand the physical challenge. The latter response is brought about by the reorganization of the cytoskeleton; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Recent research has provided major breakthroughs in our knowledge about the link between message and structure, i.e. between signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling, predominantly in the context of cell migration. The major components of this progress are the in-depth characterization of Rho family small GTPases, master regulators of the cytoskeleton, and the discovery of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex, a signalling-sensitive structural element of the actin polymerization machinery. The primary aim of this review is to find the place of these novel and crucial players in osmotically induced (volume-dependent) remodelling of the cytoskeleton. We aim to address three questions: (1) What are the major structural changes in the cytoskeleton under hyperosmotic conditions? (2) Are the Rho family small GTPases (Rho, Rac and Cdc42) regulated by osmotic stress, and if so, by what mechanisms? (3) Are Rho GTPases involved, as mediators, in major adaptive responses, including cytoskeleton rearrangement, changes in ion transport and genetic reprogramming? Our answers will show how fragmentary our current knowledge is in these areas. Therefore, this overview has been written with the hardly disguised intention that it might foster further research in this field by highlighting some intriguing questions.

AB  - Summary This chapter summaries neurological manifestations of disorders of other body systems and outlines some basic elements of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ? the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.

AB  - Diabetes is an increasingly serious health issue in the rehabilitation population. Foot ulcers develop in approximately 15% of people with diabetes and are a preceding factor in approximately 85% of lower limb amputations. Nurses have significant opportunity to positively influence client outcomes and quality of life by promoting maintenance of healthy feet, identifying emerging problems, and supporting evidence-based self-care and interdisciplinary intervention. Best practice guidelines (BPG), such as those developed by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario, provide a framework to enhance nursing practice and promote excellence in client care. This article highlights key evidence from the BPG, ?Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes,? and other relevant diabetes literature. This information better equips rehabilitation nurses to promote ulcer prevention strategies; identifies key factors in ulcer risk; and utilizes current, best evidence for ulcer assessment, management, and evaluation.
