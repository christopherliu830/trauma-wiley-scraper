AB  - Development of new local anesthetic agents has been focused on the potency of their nerve-blocking effects, duration of action and safety and has resulted in a substantial number of agents in clinical use. It is well established and well documented that the nerve blocking effects of local anesthetics are secondary to their interaction with the Na+ channels thereby blocking nerve membrane excitability and the generation of action potentials. Accumulating data suggest however that local anesthetics also posses a wide range of anti-inflammatory actions through their effects on cells of the immune system, as well as on other cells, e.g. microorganisms, thrombocytes and erythrocytes. The potent anti-inflammatory properties of local anesthetics, superior in several aspects to traditional anti-inflammatory agents of the NSAID and steroid groups and with fewer side-effects, has prompted clinicians to introduce them in the treatment of various inflammation-related conditions and diseases. They have proved successful in the treatment of burn injuries, interstitial cystitis, ulcerative proctitis, arthritis and herpes simplex infections. The detailed mechanisms of action are not fully understood but seem to involve a reversible interaction with membrane proteins and lipids thus regulating cell metabolic activity, migration, exocytosis and phagocytosis.

AB  - Abstract The enteric epithelium represents the major boundary between the outside world and the body, and in the colon it is the interface between the host and a vast and diverse microbiota. A common feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is decreased epithelial barrier function, and while a cause-and-effect relationship can be debated, prolonged loss of epithelial barrier function (whether this means the ability to sense bacteria or exclude them) would contribute to inflammation. While there are undoubtedly individual nuances in IBD, we review data in support of metabolic stress?that is, perturbed mitochondrial function?in the enterocyte as a contributing factor to the initiation of inflammation and relapses in IBD. The postulate is presented that metabolic stress, which can arise as a consequence of a variety of stimuli (e.g., infection, bacterial dysbiosis, and inflammation also), will reduce epithelial barrier function and perturb the enterocyte-commensal flora relationship and suggest that means to negate enterocytic metabolic stress should be considered as a prophylactic or adjuvant therapy in IBD.

AB  - Summary Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base-derived products, DNA?protein cross-links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen-binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8-hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its pathogenesis. Increased apoptosis and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells as observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might well be a contributory factor in systemic autoimmunity. Clinically, titres of autoantibodies are closely related to the degree of renal inflammation. Anti-DNA antibodies may combine with circulating antigen and contribute to the deposition of immune complexes in renal glomeruli.

AB  - Introduction: Much attention has been given to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws, concomitant with a history of bisphosphonate usage, particularly regarding inciting dental procedures. This report describes a case of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the hard palate after the harvesting of a subepithelial connective tissue (CT) graft for treatment of gingival recession (GR) in the mandible. Case Presentation: A 60-year-old female sought periodontal therapy for GR. Her medical history revealed the use of alendronate for osteopenia, hypothyroidism, sulfa allergy, and >18 regimens of steroid formulations (oral, inhaled, and topical) for various upper respiratory and dermatologic disorders. The hard palate was selected as the donor site for the subepithelial CT graft. At a 4-month postoperative evaluation, osteonecrosis was evident in the palatal site. Successful clinical outcome was achieved after conservative debridement, antibiotics, and use of chlorhexidine gluconate. Conclusions: It is advised that a patient's medical history include current and past intake of bisphosphonates and comorbidities that could predispose to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws. Attempts should be instituted to achieve primary wound closure of the donor site in patients who have taken bisphosphonates. Postoperative follow-up of the donor site of CT grafts should continue for at least 6 months for surveillance of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis.

AB  - The case of a 78 year old man who presented with fever and hepatic abscesses is reported. He was found to have an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm and the organism cultured was Streptococcus milleri. He was treated with an in situ Dacron graft and high-dose intravenous penicillin. This may be suitable treatment when Gram-positive organisms are involved and there is no gross peritoneal soiling.
