AB  - Abstract:? Although less than 1% of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) develop the catastrophic variant, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine today. However, the rarity of this variant makes it extraordinarily difficult to study in any systematic way. In order to put together all the published case reports as well as the new diagnosed cases from all over the world, an international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (?CAPS Registry?) was created in 2000 by the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibodies. Currently, it documents the entire clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data of more than 300 patients whose data have been fully registered. This registry can be freely consulted at the Internet (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) and it is expected that the periodical analysis of these data will allow us to increase our knowledge of this condition.

AB  - Modern medical practices allow patients to survive acute insults and be sustained by machinery and medicines for extended periods of time. We define chronic critical illness as a later stage of prolonged critical illness that requires tracheotomy. These patients have persistent elevations of inflammatory cytokines, diminished hypothalamic?pituitary function, hypercatabolism, immobilization, and malnutrition. The measurement of bone turnover markers reveals markedly enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption that is uncoupled from osteoblastic bone formation. We review the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the metabolic bone disease of chronic critical illness and suggest potential therapeutics.

AB  - Summary Inflammation of the small intestine is common worldwide. Infections are the major cause whereas chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CIBD), drugs and other conditions are less frequent causes. Worldwide, enteric infections rank third among all causes of disease burden. The main infectious agents include a variety of viruses and bacterial agents. As endoscopy is used more frequently, the pathologist is more likely to see small intestinal biopsies for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions, although histology most often does not contribute much to the specific diagnosis of infections. Histology is, however, very important in chronic conditions, allowing the identification of pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, and the differential diagnosis between CIBD and drug- or infection-related conditions, such as tuberculosis, based on the morphology of the lesions. Histological analysis is equally important for the diagnosis of inflammation in patients with a disturbed immune system, such as transplant recipients and for the identification of rare diseases.

AB  - Summary Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile human pathogen causing diseases ranging from uncomplicated mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive disease. The development of human-relevant animal models of GAS infection and introduction of new technologies have markedly accelerated the pace of discoveries related to GAS host?pathogen interactions. For example, recently investigators have identified pili on the GAS cell surface and learned that they are key components for adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. Similarly, the recent development of a transgenic mouse expressing human plasminogen has resulted in new understanding of the molecular processes contributing to invasive infection. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GAS pharyngeal, invasive and other infections holds the promise of assisting with the development of novel preventive or therapeutic agents for this prevalent human pathogen.

AB  - Abstract Proteomics analysis of bovine bronchoalveolar fluid (BAF) following induction of pneumonia with Mannheimia haemolytica using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 88 unique proteins. Proteins detected in BAF included antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), complement factors, acute-phase proteins, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in oxidation?reduction. Notwithstanding biological variation, differences in relative protein abundance, determined using normalized peptide counts, were detected for select proteins in BAF from genuinely infected versus sham-infected animals. To demonstrate the applicability of using normalized peptide counts to assess protein expression trends, LC-MS/MS data for the acute-phase protein haptoglobin (HPT) were compared with ELISA data, and statistical evaluation of the relationship between the data revealed a strong measure of association. Differences were detected between sham- and genuinely infected animals for haptoglobin, as well as the AMPs cathelicidin-1 and cathelicidin-4, and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain-4, a fairly novel protein involved in the acute phase response. Though the small sample size limited the scope of the inferences, the results indicate the likely importance of AMPs and acute-phase proteins during respiratory infection, and provide additional information regarding potential mechanisms involved in the bovine mucosal barrier defense.

AB  - Summary Inflammatory conditions of the stomach are among the most common pathological entities of the gut. Helicobacter-associated gastritis is the most common single agent infection worldwide. In the west reactive gastropathy is becoming more common, usually due to drugs and/or alcohol. There are now considerable grounds for regarding reactive gastritis as a gastropathy because one characteristic of its pathology is a singular lack of an inflammatory cell infiltrate. There are other forms of reactive gastropathy, usually with prominent vascular components, such as portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Peptic ulceration is becoming less common in the west. One important factor is the decreasing prevalence of helicobacter infection, a major cause of peptic ulceration worldwide. As with gastritis, drugs are becoming the most important causative factor. However, peptic ulceration, as a whole, remains important, in both the stomach and the duodenum, not least because of the very considerable morbidity of its complications. Although less common than reactive gastropathy and Helicobacter-associated gastritis, there are other important forms of gastritis. Chronic atrophic gastritis is now accepted, principally, as a long-term consequence of helicobacter infection in the stomach. It is often difficult to diagnose on biopsy, but is an important predisposing factor to carcinoma and primary endocrine tumours of the stomach. Not surprisingly, given the highly acidic surroundings, infections other than with Helicobacter sp., which is especially adapted for life in the harsh environment of the stomach, are unusual but they do occur, especially viral gastritides. Lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous gastritis, collagenous gastritis and eosinophilic gastritis all provide interesting pathological problems and have important associations.

AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
