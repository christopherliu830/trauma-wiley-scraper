AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The short- and long-term thrombogenicity of implant materials is still unpredictable, which is a significant challenge for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A knowledge-based approach for implementing biofunctions in materials requires a detailed understanding of the medical device in the biological system. In particular, the interplay between material and blood components/cells as well as standardized and commonly acknowledged in vitro test methods allowing a reproducible categorization of the material thrombogenicity requires further attention. Here, the status of in vitro thrombogenicity testing methods for biomaterials is reviewed, particularly taking in view the preparation of test materials and references, the selection and characterization of donors and blood samples, the prerequisites for reproducible approaches and applied test systems. Recent joint approaches in finding common standards for a reproducible testing are summarized and perspectives for a more disease oriented in vitro thrombogenicity testing are discussed.

AB  - A variety of benign and malignant cutaneous vascular lesions occur in irradiated skin. We report two cases of vascular lesions that developed on the breast within a year after radiation therapy for breast carcinoma. Both cases mimicked Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) histologically. We compare these with one case of post-irradiation angiosarcoma and 3 cases of acquired progressive lymphangioma (APL) unrelated to radiation therapy. The post-irradiation vascular lesions showed slit-like vessels dissecting through superficial dermal collagen, leading to an initial diagnosis of KS by one contributing pathologist. Immunohistochemically, the vessels in both cases expressed CD31 and CD34, stained only partially for actin, and had a low Ki67 proliferation index. Neither case expressed HHV8. The post-irradiation angiosarcoma occurred three years after radiation, and also exhibited a focal slit-like growth pattern resembling KS. However, there was marked cytologic atypia, a high proliferation rate, and negative staining for HHV8. The APL were characterized by more ectactic vascular spaces and deeper involvement of the dermis than was present in the post-irradiation lesions. These cases also failed to stain for HHV8. Recognition of the phenomenon of post-irradiation vascular proliferations is important, especially because such lesions may resemble KS, yet invariably follow a benign clinical course.

AB  - The histological distinction between dermatofibroma (DF) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) may be difficult. CD34 and Factor XIIIa have been used to differentiate DF from DFSP, but there is a lack of specificity. CD44 is a membrane glycoprotein which has multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing of variant exons. CD44 is the principal cell surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA). In this study we explored the expression of standard CD44 (CD44s) and its isoforms (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8, and CD44v10), and HA in DF and DFSP. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the biopsy specimens of 15 cases of DF and 4 cases of DFSP, using antibodies for the CD44s and its isoforms, and hyaluronate binding protein (HABP). Tumor cells displayed a strong CD44s immunoreactivity in all cases of DF whereas a faint HA positivity was observed in the tumor stroma. DF cells were negative for CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v6, CD44v7 and CD44v7v8 but they showed a strong reactivity for CD44v5 and CD44v10. CD44s expression was significantly reduced or absent in all DFSP lesions and the tumor stroma displayed a strong staining for HA. Our results indicate that CD44 and HA can be used as additional diagnostic markers to distinguish DF from DFSP.

AB  - A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented with generalised skin rash. Gingival hyperplasia and hepatosplenomegaly were also noted. His laboratory data showed hemoglobin of 10.3?g/dL, white blood cell count of 203.6?K/uL and platelet count of 72?K/uL. Peripheral blood smears revealed that 67% of the white blood cells was monoblasts, 25% was promonocytes and atypical monocytes. Bone marrow aspirate smears showed that 97% of the nucleated cells were composed of monoblasts and promonocytes. Approximately 80% of the immature cells showed intense non-specific butyrate esterase activity. The morphologic and cytochemical findings were compatible with a diagnosis of acute monocytic leukaemia. Skin biopsy taken from the left medial thigh revealed a Grenz zone and a dense infiltrate of atypical cells throughout the dermis. The cells were positive for KP1 (CD68) immunohistochemical stain. The findings were consistent with cutaneous manifestation of leukaemia (leukaemia cutis). The patient?s condition deteriorated rapidly despite chemotherapy and expired 10 days after initial presentation. Leukaemia cutis is more common in acute monoblastic/monocytic leukaemia (AMoL) than in other subtypes of leukaemia. Leukaemia gingival hyperplasia is another characteristic feature of AMoL. Dissemination to the skin is generally associated with a poor prognosis.

AB  - Tattoo pigment in sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma patients is a clinical challenge. A 77-year-old man presented with a pink nodular lesion of the right upper arm. Biopsy revealed a 1.9?mm thick, Clark level 4 nodular melanoma. A wide local excision with 2?cm margins and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was planned. Pre operative lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-99?m demonstrated a single strongly pigmented SLN in the right axilla. A prominent tattoo was located on the patient?s upper arm in the area of the melanoma. The clinical impression was highly suspicious for metastatic disease and the tissue was sent to pathology for examination. Frozen section showed a lymph node with benign histiocytes. There were black non-polarizable coarse granules in the subcapsular, sinusoidal areas and also in the histiocytes. Review of permanent hematoxylin and eosin sections as well as immunohistochemical analysis with MART-1 and HMB-45 showed no evidence of metastatic melanoma in the SLN. Pigmentation of lymph nodes is not pathognomic of malignant melanoma. Black pigmented lymph nodes can occur by carbon deposits of tattoo pigment as in our case. Histological confirmation of metastatic malignant melanoma in the SLN is imperative before proceeding to complete regional lymph node dissection.

AB  - A 57-year-old woman presented with a three-week history of an erythematous nodule on her palm. The clinical diagnosis was pyogenic granuloma. Histology revealed a circumscribed dermal nodule of uniform, primitive round cells with numerous mitotic figures and apoptopic cells. The tumor cells showed strong membranous immunoreactivity for CD99 and nuclear immunoreactivity for Fli-1. The tumor cells were negative for S-100 protein, cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and actin. The diagnosis of Ewing?s sarcoma was made. CT scans showed no evidence of an osseous or deep soft tissue primary tumor or metastatic disease. The tumor was excised with 1?cm margins, and the patient received six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. One year after diagnosis, the patient is alive without evidence of disease. Extraosseous Ewing?s sarcoma (EES) rarely presents as a primary skin tumor and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors involving the skin. It is important to distinguish primary cutaneous EES from secondary involvement of the skin by ES, as primary cutaneous EES has a more indolent course compared to classic EES or osseous ES. Immunohistochemical stains for CD99 and Fli-1 are useful markers to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous ES.

Laboratory studies revealed an elevated ANA and ESR but normal rheumatoid factor, TSH, Lyme, anti-DNA, and SSA/SSB antibodies. Biopsies from the sacrum and left leg showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of foamy histiocytes, epitheliod cells, and multinucleated giant cells, as well as lymphocytes and eosinophils in the entire dermis. The patient was diagnosed with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with plaques. The lesions resolved spontaneously. IGD with plaques is a rare but benign disorder of uncertain etiology. Its characteristic histopathology and clinical appearance distinguish it from other granulomatous dermatitis.

AB  - This patient was a 61-year-old white female who received several years of penicillamine therapy for the treatment of cystinuria. She subsequently developed penicillamine induced cutis laxa, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum like skin lesions. In addition, she suffered from numerous chronic bilateral lower extremity skin ulcerations. Her past medical history was also significant for end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis and pulmonary fibrosis. She presented to the University of Miami Wound Care Center in 1/04 for treatment of her chronic ulcerations. On physical examination, the patient had multiple large hyperpigmented plaques with central ulcerations on her lower extremities. Some of the ulcers had overlying crust and others were covered with yellow fibrinous tissue. She also had generalized thickened, lax skin with multiple folds. On her neck, thighs, back and arms were violaceous, atrophic, serpiginous plaques with peripheral crusted erosions. A biopsy taken from the patients left thigh revealed dermal elastosis and the features of pseudo-pseudoxanthoma. Two additional biopsies taken from the left thigh demonstrated elastosis perforans serpiginosa. This case highlights multiple skin manifestations of penicillamine therapy.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have undertaken a review of the Massachusetts General Hospital experience of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). Twelve cases were identified, and the dermatopathologic features of lesional skin biopsies were examined. We looked systematically at nine parameters and graded each on a scale of 0 (minimal or none) to 3 (highest or most): 1) extent of fibrocytic proliferation, 2) extent of collagen thickening, 3) extent of vascularity, 4) extent of pannicular involvement, 5) extent of elastolysis, 6) presence of mucin, 7) presence of calcification, 8) presence of giant cells, and 9) presence of inflammation. Results demonstrate that fibrocytic proliferation, collagen thickening, inflammation, and vascularity most commonly were classified as grade 1?2; mucin deposition and elastolysis varied from 0?2; pannicular involvement ranged from 1?3; nearly all had calcification grade of 0, and there were no giant cells detected in any of the twelve cases. Comparing our results to published reports suggests that there are some interesting observations. Our cases tended to be less fibrocellular, have less mucin, and have more vascularity than the initial 14 cases described by Cowper et?al (2001). The implications of the dermatopathologic findings for clinical course and prognosis are currently being evaluated.

AB  - Hyaline globules (HG) are frequently found in neoplastic cells of Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS). Presence of HG, characteristic of but not specific of KS, has been considered to represent erythrophagocytosis. In order to further characterize the nature of HG, we studied 10 cases of cutaneous KS with distinct HG using immunohistochemistry for hemoglobin A, Kappa and Lambda. All KS cases were of nodular type. Also included were 3 cases of glomeruloid hemangioma with similar HG in endothelial cells for the comparision. In selected cases electron microscopic examination was performed. PAS stain with diastase digestion was also done in all cases. Results: HG were diastase resistant and PAS positive. All HG in neoplastic cells of KS and endothelial cells of GH were negative for hemoglobin A. There was variable staining for light chains: focal but strong positivity for kappa, weak and variable staining for Lambda. Some HG was positive for both kappa and lambda. Electron microscopic study demonstrated HG as homogeneous electron dense inclusions with internal small vacuoles, whorled or granular materials. Conclusions: All HG in neoplastic cells and endothelial cells of GH represent phagolysosomes. Negative stain for hemoglobin A in KS and GH do not support the inclusions being fragmented RBC?s.

AB  - A 61-year-old female presented with blurry vision. Questioning revealed ?Flu-like? symptoms preceding the blurry vision by two weeks. An ophthalmologist diagnosed anterior granulomatous dermatitis, which improved with prednisolone drops. One month later, an ?itchy rash? and constitutional symptoms including fever, night sweats, and weight loss were reported. Physical examination revealed a viral-type maculopapular eruption over the trunk and proximal extremities. A few weeks later, repeat examination showed progression to a diffuse, reddish-brown, slightly edematous, papular eruption. Lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia, a polyclonal gammopathy, and an elevated ESR. Punch biopsies on two occasions showed a proliferation of mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytic cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. Emperipolesis was easily demonstrated. A background of plasma cells and small lymphocytes were noted. Stains for organisms were negative, and polarizable material was not present. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes marked with S-100 but were negative for CD1a. A diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai Dorfman was made. The cutaneous symptoms improved over six months without medical therapy. Cutaneous Rosai Dorfman disease with constitutional symptoms and laboratory evidence of systemic involvement but without lymphadenopathy has not been previously described. This unusual case suggests that a wider spectrum of disease presentation may exist.

AB  - An 11-year-old adopted male presented with deforming scalp and bilateral posterior auricular nodules, joint contractures, and gingival hypertrophy. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodules revealed a normal epidermis with areas of extracellular eosinophilic ground substance surrounding benign spindle-shaped (myo)fibroblasts in the dermis and subcutis, alternating with hyalinized, acellular zones. The spindle cells did not show cytologic atypia. A diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) was given. The patient had been seen multiple times in the past for similar recurring, disfiguring dermal and subcutaneous nodules. The patient had a history of osteolytic lesions of the distal radius and ulna and hyaline deposition involving the sigmoid colon and rectum. JHF is a rare autosomal recessive hyalinosis with mutations of the Capillary Morphogenesis Gene-2 (CMG-2) at chromosome 4q21, a region that encodes a binding protein that concatenates capillary collagen IV to laminin. Other genetic abnormalities include mutations in dermal collagen (types I and III). Disease onset occurs early in life. Organ involvement is an ominous sign usually resulting in death during infancy or early childhood. Surgery is the only presently available treatment.

AB  - Cellular blue nevus is composed of dendritic melanocytes, together with islands of epithelioid and plump spindle cells. We examined 58 cases of blue nevi. Fourteen cases were common blue nevi. The remaining 44 blue nevi were divided into three types according to its silhouettes. These were nodular (type 1, 18 cases), nodular with notch (type 2, 16 cases), and rounded pushing patterns (type 3, 10 cases). Well circumscribed top heavy nodule was observed in type 1, and it was limited to the dermis. Type 2 showed budding appearance into the subcutaneous tissue. Type 3 revealed bottom heavy with downward pushing margin. Both type 2 and type 3 were demonstrated biphasic patterns of epithelioid and spindle cells. Perineural distribution of melanocytes was also observed in type 2 and 3. The size of these types was 3.3?mm in type 1, 4.7?mm in type 2, and 7.4?mm in type 3. The thickness of these types was 1.6?mm in type 1, 2.5?mm in type 2, and 5.2?mm in type 3. Our results suggest that cellular blue nevi may be divided into three stages. Type 1 is its early stage, and may be misinterpreted as common blue nevi.
