AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

AB  - Nonmyeloablative hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recent alternative to myeloablative HSCT in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as a complication of both types of HSCT. Recently the clinical phenomenon of late-onset (>100 days) acute GVHD has been described following nonablative HSCT. However, there has been no relevant description of the histologic features of GVHD in this setting. We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of 28 cases of acute and chronic GVHD following nonablative HSCT at out institution between 2000 and 2003. Our results support the observation of late onset acute GVHD in nonablative HSCT. The mean onset of acute GVHD was 109.8 days (range 8?410 days). Furthermore, we identified a subset of patients (8/23) in the acute GVHD group with composite histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD. This subset was more likely to develop chronic GVHD as compared to patients with only classic acute GVHD, 87.5% versus 25%, respectively (p?<?0.01). Composite histologic features could serve a a predictor of an increased risk for the development of chronic GVHD. These patients may potentially benefit from more aggressive treatment than patients with histologic features of solely acute GVHD.

AB  - Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma typically presents as solitary, well-circumscribed, firm plaques or nodules. We describe a case of cutaneous leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag on the thigh of a 50-year-old male. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a dome-shaped tumor with interlacing fascicles of smooth muscle with pleomorphism, cellular atypia and multiple mitoses. Malignant tumors may rarely present as a skin tag, and these are most frequently basal cell carcinomas. We are unaware of previously reported leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag. This case suggests that solitary, wide-based, papilloma-like lesions or skin tags should be submitted for histologic examination to rule out malignancy.

AB  - The Src-family tyrosine kinases are modulators of growth-regulatory signals within keratinocytes. The relationship between Src kinases and epidermal neoplasia is unexplored in human biopsies. Keratinocytes express 3 Src kinases: Src, Fyn, Yes. Activation of these kinases corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylation? near the active site, tyrosine 416 of human Src. This study compared the levels of total Src-kinase protein and activated Src kinases within a spectrum of lesions ranging from actinic keratoses (AKs) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An antibody that recognizes an epitope in Src, Fyn, and Yes revealed the total level of Src kinase protein; an antibody specific for the phosphoryated active site tyrosine determined the level of Src kinase activation. The level of Src-kinase expression and activated Src kinases was evaluated in paraffin imbedded sections of AKs, SCC in-situ (SCIS), and SCC containing adjacent unremarkable epidermis. The total level of Src kinase protein in lesions was similar to unremarkable epidermis. The level of Src kinase activation was elevated within approximately one-third of AKs and SCIS, but was increased in over 80% of SCCs. These results demonstrate Src kinases are activated in epidermal neoplasia, and that increased Src kinase activity is associated with the transition from SCIS to SCC.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that typically arises in the pleural cavity but may also be seen at extra-pleural sites including liver, lung, thymus, orbit, soft tissue, and rarely the skin. The diagnosis of cutaneous SFT is challenging due to its histologic variability and lack of distinctive immunophenotype. We report a case of SFT with unusual histologic and immunophenotypic findings. A 23-year-old man presented with a two-year history of a painful, enlarging scalp mass. Histologic examination revealed a variably cellular neoplasm composed of tumor cells with uniform oval nuclei embedded in a collagenous matrix. In areas there was a prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature. The tumor was strongly immunoreactive for CD34 and had some immunoreactivity for S100. The diagnosis of SFT was rendered based upon the histologic features and strong immunoreactivity for CD34. Immunoreactivity for S100 is rarely seen in SFT. The tumor had a mitotic rate of 8/50?hpf. Mitotic rates greater than 5/50?hpf have been associated with aggressive behavior in SFTs of soft tissue. The significance of aggressive histologic attributes with clinical outcome is yet to be determined in cutaneous SFT. Cutaneous SFTs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of superficial spindle cell tumors.

AB  - With the advance of our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of the immune system and inflammatory process, biological modulators, such as anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, are increasingly used in the treatment of immune disorders and hematogenous neoplasm. Side effects of those biological modulators, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichenoid drug reaction, acute folliculitis, and superficial granuloma annulare, have been reported. Recently, we encountered two patients who developed interstitial granulomatous drug reaction while receiving anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. The patients, a 48 year-old male and a 54 year-old female, both have severe rheumatoid arthritis and responded poorly to conventional therapies, received Remicade (Infliximab). Pruritic erythematous skin eruptions developed on the trunk and extremities one month after starting the therapy. The lesions are multiple irritated papules and plaques; some are targetoid, measuring several centimeters, with raised borders. Skin biopsies showed an interstitial granulomatous infiltrate in the mid- and deep dermis. The infiltrate is composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils, palisade around degenerating collagen. Pathological diagnosis was drug-induced interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. Discontinuation of Remicade led to resolution of the skin lesions in both patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a drug eruption caused by anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

AB  - An 8-year-old male presented with several 1?4?cm, indurated, brownish-red nodules with superficial, punctate hemorrhagic crusts localized to the groin, which developed over several weeks. An initial biopsy was consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A work up, including a chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Treatment with a chemotherapeutic protocol resulted in shrinkage of both the mediastinal and cutaneous lesions. Late in the course of treatment the cutaneous lesions rapidly recurred and spread to various sites. A second skin biopsy showed an extensive diffuse infiltrate of histiocytic-appearing cells extending from the papillary dermis into the superficial subcutis. The cells had markedly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures were present. The neoplastic cells were S-100 protein and CD1a positive by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was Langerhans cell sarcoma. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor gamma gene in specimens from both the mediastinal mass and one of the recurrent cutaneous lesions. The sizes of the PCR products were identical demonstrating a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms.

AB  - Expensive telepathology programs are known for long. Instant messaging, in contrast, is a new trend that will permeate serious enterprises, including dermatopathology. We present an adaptation of microscopy to the MSN Messenger that allows simple and instant sharing of images through the Internet. Any digital camera can act as a webcam, even if no picture is taken. Images through a camera tethered to a microscope can be captured into the PC in real time as video. An inexpensive Belkin VideoBus II card (?$50) between the AV cable of the camera and the PC, using an USB port, is used as the capture device (among others). In the MSN Messenger v. 6.1, the Audio/Video Tuning Wizard (from ?Tools?) is notified that the Belkin capture mode will be used as video-composite input. The same card could optionally capture audio from any microphone. The above procedure will produce relatively high quality images in the Messenger image subwindow when the digital camera is activated. The interlocutor can broadcast images back. The only limitation is the relatively small size of the Messenger window. This is an example of current mass-appeal technologies that presage the marriage of teledermatopathology and instant messaging.

AB  - A 52-year-old male with Crohn?s disease presented with florid pustulosis of the face and trunk. Six months prior to presentation, he received amphotericin for pulmonary aspergillosis. Amphotericin was discontinued after five months due to toxicity, and pharmacotherapy was changed to voriconazole. After four weeks of voriconazole, the acneiform eruption occurred which prompted referral to dermatology. Physical examination revealed innumerable 0.5?cm?1.5?cm pustules, cysts, and inflammatory papules concentrated predominantly over the central face, ears, and conjunctiva, but also involving the chest, shoulders, and back. The clinical differential diagnosis included suppurative folliculitis, papulonecrotic tuberculid, cutaneous Crohn?s disease, acne fulminans, and pustular drug eruption. Multiple biopsies demonstrated diffuse neutrophilic and granulomatous dermal inflammation in a predominantly follicular and perifollicular distribution. Microorganisms were not identified by either histology or culture. The histologic differential diagnosis included cutaneous Crohn?s disease and pustular drug eruption. Voriconazole was discontinued with gradual clearing of the skin lesions. Three months later, worsening of the pulmonary disease necessitated restarting voriconazole. A recurrent pustular eruption, similar to the original eruption, occurred within weeks and subsequently cleared upon discontinuation of voriconazole. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of a voriconazole induced pustular drug eruption.

AB  - Acetylglucosoaminyltransferase V (GNTV), an enzyme responsible for branching of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Beta1?6 branched oligosaccharides, detected with the lectin, LPHA, are associated with tumor progression in human breast and colon cancer. They were found to be common to 22 types of human cancers, and were particularly expressed in metastases. Matriptase is a proteolytic inducer of both the HGF/cmet and plasminogen activator pathways, highly associated with metastasis. A potential prometastatic effect of GNTV was found to be due to modification of active matriptase by adding beta1?6 GlcNAc branching. We investigated expression of LPHA, matriptase and GNTV in pathology specimens of primary invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas. Sequential sections were stained with anti-GnT-V, anti-matriptase, or biotinylated LPHA. Our results showed variable staining patterns, from involving only small regions, to encompassing the entire tumor. The expression of all three markers was closely associated, suggesting that metastatic pathways might have been activated in the staining areas of these tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of matriptase expression in malignant melanoma, as well as the first demonstration of an association between matriptase, GNTV and beta 1,6-branched oligosaccharides in vivo.

AB  - A 41 year-old man presented with an atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque on the right lower abdomen present since?birth?. He denied any prior activity at the site, and had been told it was a ?scar? from a prenatal insult. Six months earlier, he developed idiopathic focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis and was placed on 70?mg prednisone per day. He had not demonstrated evidence of lupus eythematosus. Shortly after beginning this regimen, erythematous and tender papules developed around the quiescent plaque. He had tapered his prednisone dose to 60?mg per day, but additional papules continued to erupt. An ellipse biopsy was performed which included a portion of the atrophic plaque and several surrounding papules. Histological examination revealed a proliferation of fibrohistiocytes between and amongst collagen bundles. In some areas, fibrohistiocytes entrapped collagen in a fashion reminiscent of a dermatofibroma. In other areas, particularly that of the atrophic plaque, the fibrohistiocytes were less numerous and more delicate in appearance. Scattered rudimentary fascicles were demonstrated. Adnexal structures were preserved. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the fibrohistiocytes to be positive for factor XIIIa and actin, but negative for desmin, CD34, S-100, procollagen I, and CD68. This lesion demonstrated unique clinical/histiological aspects not well characterized in the literature.

AB  - Lipedematous alopecia is a rare entity of uncertain etiology characterized by a diffusely thickened and boggy scalp, with varying degrees of alopecia. Six of eight cases in the literature have occurred in African American women. Classic histopathologic findings include increased subcutaneous tissue, varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis, and an absence of significant mucin deposition. Herein, we report an additional case of lipedematous alopecia occurring in an African American woman who also demonstrated clinical, historical, and histopathologic findings reminiscent of discoid lupus erythematosus. Explicit observation of such an occurrence has not been made previously, although hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, mild perivascular or periadnexal infiltrates, and fibrosing alopecia have been reported in lipedematous scalp, possibly the residua of other cases with associated discoid lupus-like features. For further comparison, we contrast our case with a second patient with lipedematous scalp, which maintained histological similarities to lipedematous alopecia, but was lacked any significant hair loss. It is possible that some cases lipedematous alopecia may represent an unusual sequela of discoid lupus erythematosus. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of two diseases occurring independently, nor that early changes of lipedematous alopecia might share histopathological and/or clinical findings with discoid lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have reviewed sixteen patients with the diagnosis of desmoplastic Spitz nevus. The age of our patients ranged between seven years and fifty-four years. We noted a predominance of twelve female patients and four male patients. Histologically, ten of the sixteen cases were well circumscribed and symmetric. In six cases we were unable to ascertain the overall architectural features because of the biopsy technique. Only three cases showed significant junctional melanocytic nesting. In five cases there were rare nests of melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction and in eight cases there was no evidence of melanocytic nesting at the dermo-epidermal junction. Dermal mitotic figures were rare, with five cases showing a single dermal mitotic figure. The lesions did not arise in sun damaged skin as evidenced by the rarity of actinic elastosis within our specimens. Additional clinical and histologic findings and follow up will be reported.

AB  - Cutaneous adnexal tumors manifesting divergent differentiation are a rare but recognized subset of adnexal neoplasms. We present a 42-year-old woman with a cystic tumor of the skin above the left eyebrow. A biopsy revealed a tumor comprising eccrine tubules lined by a single row of columnar epithelium surrounded by a peripheral small cuboidal layer and containing, adhered to the internal cuticle, mucin-like material. In some areas, the eccrine tubules were associated with sheets of small plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells embedded in a chondroid matrix. Elsewhere, there were cysts containing central keratinous debris associated with a peripheral basaloid epithelial proliferation showing the formation of buds mimicking abortive hair follicle structures. No polarizable terminal or vellus hairs were seen. These two elements were geographically separate in the biopsy but collided in the center of the tissue element. A diagnosis of benign cutaneous mixed tumor with combined folliculosebaceous and eccrine differentiation was rendered. Such tumors present a diagnostic challenge and are frequently confused with neoplasms including the benign mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) and a variety of eccrine and folliculosebaceous neoplasms and harmatomata. This case illustrates the potential multilineage differentiation of pluripoential germinative cells of the cutaneous adnexae.
