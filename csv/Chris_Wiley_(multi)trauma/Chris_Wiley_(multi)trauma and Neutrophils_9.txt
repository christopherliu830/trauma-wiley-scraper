AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver grafts are associated with inferior clinical outcomes and high discard rates because of poor graft quality. We investigated the predictive value of DCD liver biopsy for the pretransplant graft quality evaluation. DCD liver transplants that took place between October 2010 and April 2014 were included (n?=?127). Histological features of graft biopsy samples were analyzed to assess risk factors for graft survival. Macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.973; P?=?0.045] and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate (HR?=?6.969; P?=?0.005) were confirmed as independent risk factors for graft survival; hepatocellular swelling, vacuolation, and necrosis failed to show prognostic value. Additionally, a donor serum total bilirubin level?≥?34.2 ?mol/L was also associated with a lower probability of graft survival. Our analysis indicates that macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate are novel and useful histological markers for DCD liver grafts with unacceptable quality. This finding can be used by transplant surgeons to improve DCD liver acceptance protocols. Liver Transpl 21:838?846, 2015. ? 2015 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS, e.g., liver, spleen) is often treated as a ?blackbox? by nanoresearchers in translating nanomedicines. Often, most of the injected nanomaterials are sequestered by the MPS, preventing their delivery to the desired disease areas. Here, this imperfection is exploited by applying nano-antioxidants with preferential liver uptake to directly prevent hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related disease. Ceria nanoparticles (NPs) are selected as a representative nano-antioxidant and the detailed mechanism of preventing IRI is investigated. It is found that ceria NPs effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of hepatic IRI by scavenging ROS, inhibiting activation of Kupffer cells and monocyte/macrophage cells. The released pro-inflammatory cytokines are then significantly reduced and the recruitment and infiltration of neutrophils are minimized, which suppress subsequent inflammatory reaction involved in the liver. The protective effect of nano-antioxidants against hepatic IRI in living animals and the revealed mechanism herein suggests their future use for the treatment of hepatic IRI in the clinic.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Myeloproliferative disorders involving the megakaryocytic line are uncommon but in recent years several reports have come from North America and the United Kingdom describing megakaryoblastic leukaemia (MbL) and a particular form called essential thrombocythaemia (ET). This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Background Dematiaceous, or dark-pigmented, fungi are known to cause infections such as phaeohyphomycosis, chromoblastomycosis, and mycetoma. These fungi are becoming increasingly important opportunistic pathogens in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR). We present a retrospective chart review of 27 SOTR who developed phaeohyphomycosis infections post transplant from 1988 to 2009. Methods Cases were reviewed for fungal species isolated, date and source of culture, immunosuppressive and fungal therapy used, and outcome. The majority of isolates obtained were from the skin and soft tissue, with 3 pulmonary and brain abscesses. Results The time from transplantation to onset of infection ranged from 2 months to 11 years. The species isolated were Exophiala (11), Ochroconis (3), Alternaria (2), Phoma (2), Wangiella (1), Cladosporium (1), Aureobasidium (1), Chaetomium (1), Coniothyrium (1), and non-sporulating fungi (2). An additional 4 patients had infections confirmed by pathology, but no cultures were done. Most of the affected skin lesions were surgically debrided and treated with itraconazole; 2 patients were treated with voriconazole and 2 with amphotericin D. Death from fungal disease occurred only in patients with pulmonary and brain abscesses. Conclusions As the number of SOTR increases, so does the incidence of fungal infections in that population. Surgery, along with antifungal therapy and a reduction in immunosuppression, are the cornerstones of treatment.

Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether dogs with surgically excised mast cell tumours receiving a vinblastine/prednisolone chemotherapy protocol in combination with radiation therapy are at greater risk of myelosuppression than patients receiving the chemotherapy protocol alone. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of clinical records of dogs with mast cell tumours that, subsequent to surgical excision, had received combination vinblasine/prednisolone chemotherapy. Dogs were assigned to two groups: those treated with adjunctive radiotherapy and vinblastine/prednisolone (RT group) and those treated with surgery followed by vinblastine/prednisolone alone (control group). Haematology results were compared between groups. Results Forty-three cases and 43 controls of similar breed, age and bodyweight were included. Concurrent radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy did not appear to increase the risk of neutropenia, which was observed in 18.6 and 23.2% of cases in the RT and control groups, respectively. Clinical Significance Radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy can be safely combined in dogs with mast cell tumours without increasing the risk of clinically important myelosuppression.

AB  - Aim: It is reported that Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the number and functions of the neutrophils of blood in animal models. In the present study, we observed the effects of G-CSF in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: Pancreatitis was induced by injection of 0.2?ml of 3% taurocholate acid into biliopancreatic duct of the Wistar rat. Thirty rats were randomized into three groups. 1: Control group (C group). 2: Acute pancreatitis (AP) group. 3: AP?+?G-CSF groups. G-CSF was administrated via jugular veins 1 hour before induction of pancreatitis. Blood and ascites at 1 and 3 hours after induction of pancreatitis were measured for the number of neutrophils, their phagocytosis and bactericidal activity and the concentrations of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â. Results: The phagocytic neutrophils increased in AP?+?G-CSF group (22?±?4.3???105) compared with AP group (10?±?1.9???105)(p?<?0.05); the bactericidal neutrophils increased in AP?+?G-CSF group (60?±?14.5???105) compared with AP group (20?±?6.1???105)(p?<?0.05). G-CSF did not increase any the concentration of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â in blood and ascites. Conclusions: G-CSF increases the number of phagocytic and bactericidal neutrophils of blood and ascites in SAP rat, without increasing the concentration of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â, therefore improves host defense against infection.

AB  - Introduction It has been debated which airway sampling method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirate (TA), is superior in evaluating equine respiratory disease. Most studies suggest BAL is the best sampling method due to better correlation with lung histopathology. In this study we compared BAL and TA results of athletic non-Thoroughbred horses with chronic respiratory signs or exercise intolerance during 2009?2013. Methods 64 horses, 2?25 years of age (16 Coldbloods, 30 Warmbloods, 11 Standardbreds, 7 ponies) with recurrent or chronic (duration >1 month) respiratory signs or exercise intolerance that were subject to both BAL and TA sampling at rest were included. Neutrophil counts >5% in BAL and >20% in TA were considered abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Both BAL and TA were abnormal in 29 horses and normal in 26 horses. 7 horses had only abnormal TA and 2 horses only abnormal BAL. Correlation was found between the amount of mucus in the trachea and both BAL (P?=?0.002) and TA (P<0.001) neutrophil percentage. Neutrophil (P<0.001), eosinophil (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P?=?0.008) and macrophage (P?=?0.004) percentages correlated between BAL and TA. Conclusions In our university hospital population, mucus in the trachea was a good indicator of airway neutrophilia. Unlike previous studies, in only 14% of the horses the interpretation of BAL and TA result was different with TA being slightly more sensitive at detecting neutrophilia. However, a gold standard for detecting inflammation in the equine airways is still lacking and the type and severity of the disease may greatly influence the best choice of sampling method.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mast cells, important sensor and effector cells of the immune system, may influence bone metabolism as their number is increased in osteoporotic patients. They are also present during bone fracture healing with currently unknown functions. Using a novel c-Kit-independent mouse model of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrated that mast cells did not affect physiological bone turnover. However, they triggered local and systemic inflammation after fracture by inducing release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of innate immune cells. In later healing stages, mast cells accumulated and regulated osteoclast activity to remodel the bony fracture callus. Furthermore, they were essential to induce osteoclast formation after ovariectomy. Additional in vitro studies revealed that they promote osteoclastogenesis via granular mediators, mainly histamine. In conclusion, mast cells are redundant in physiologic bone turnover but exert crucial functions after challenging the system, implicating mast cells as a potential target for treating inflammatory bone disorders. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Sternal sepsis following median sternotomy is an infrequent yet devastating complication of cardiac surgery, leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital expense, and a high associated morbidity and mortality. The development of sternotomy infection is multi-factorial. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies have pointed to a multitude of clinical and perioperative variables as being causative, with as many other studies presenting evidence to the contrary. This has led to confusion about which clinical variables should be modified so as to minimize the individual patient's risk for developing this severe complication. Other less obvious factors also come into play. Malnutrition, whether overt or subclinical, is not uncommon in cardiac patients. Immune competency is affected by operative trauma, as well as a variety of perioperative factors including underlying nutritional status, transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and anesthesia. This creates a complex milieu for the development of postoperative infection. In this review, the multiple risk factors of median sternotomy infection are studied and treatment options briefly discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To describe a case of a conjunctivo-corneal mass in a cat associated with acid-fast bacilli. Methods? A 2-year-old female black European Short-Hair cat, living outdoors in a suburban environment in Italy, was referred for evaluation of a nodular, vascularized mass of 2 weeks duration. The mass involved the dorsal bulbar conjunctiva at the temporal canthus of OS and invaded the sclera and cornea. Routine ophthalmic and systemic examination, serologic testing, cytology and histology of the mass were performed. Mycobacterium specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of variable regions 1, 2 and 3 of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was also performed. Results? Neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and giant cells with intracytoplasmic acid-fast bacilli were seen on cytological examination. The histological examination confirmed the presence of a granulomatous lesion with acid-fast bacilli within macrophages. Bacteriological culture of the material from the lesion was negative for Mycobacterium spp. Mycobacterium 16S rRNA gene specific PCR was positive. A diagnosis of feline leprosy was made. The owners refused any treatment, and 1 year later the lesion was still present. Conclusions? Veterinary ophthalmologists should be aware of conjunctivo-corneal leproma as an unusual symptom of leprosy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - Abstract The Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo has been housing and breeding slender-tailed cloud rats (Phleomys pallidus) since 1985. Records of 82 animals from 1985 to 2013 were reviewed for this study. The animals were kept successfully in small family groups with a single adult male, multiple adult females, and their offspring. Sexual maturity was noted at approximately 2 years of age and gestation length ranged from 52 to 55 days. Animals were fed a diet including a complete commercial pelleted feed, mixed greens, carrot or yam, mixed hard nuts, and locally sourced browse. Medical conditions requiring treatment in neonates were often fatal whereas most medical conditions in adults were survivable. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates was maternal neglect or trauma (42%, 5/12 antemortem problems; cause of death in 32%, 8/25). The most significant problems in adults were cryptococcal pneumonia and trauma. Cryptococcus sp. was the cause of death in 11 cases (34%, 11/32) and significant comorbidity in an additional three cases. Treatment with antifungal medications was attempted but was unsuccessful in four cases. Many cases of trauma were treated successfully with conservative management or limited intervention. In four cases, treatment was complicated by extensive self-mutilation after surgical repair of traumatic lesions, which resulted in death or euthanasia. Lymphoplasmacytic thyroiditis was a common postmortem finding in adults (95%, 21/22 for which the thyroid gland was examined histologically). It is unclear if thyroiditis resulted in functional hypothyroidism so the significance of this finding is undetermined.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinical differences and variable response to therapy had been suspected between sport horses with predominantly eosinophils and/or mast cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and horses with predominantly neutrophilia in the BALF. Objectives To examine possible differences in performance, response to treatment and prognosis between both groups. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods A total of 174 client-owned sport horses that were presented to the Wolvega Equine Clinic for respiratory problems between 2008 and 2013 were included. A questionnaire was used for follow-up at least 3 months after diagnosis. Cytological BALF counts were considered increased when: neutrophils >5%; eosinophils >1% and mast cells >2%. Data were analysed using SPSS software and Chi square tests. Results Cough and highest mucus scores were significantly more associated with neutrophilic IAD (P?=?0.009 and P?=?0.007). The neutrophilia group was also significantly more responsive to therapy, often including corticosteroid inhalation, and management optimisation (P?=?0.001) and had better long-term prognosis when compared to horses from the eosinophilic or mast cell groups (P<0.001). Lowest tracheal mucus scores were reported for the eosinophilic group, followed by the mast cell group. Haemosiderophage scores were significantly higher in the eosinophilic and mast cell groups (P<0.001). Poor performance was reported significantly more frequently in horses with eosinophils and mast cells as the main inflammatory cell population in their BALF (P?=?0.001). Conclusions Inflammatory airway disease with predominantly mast cells or eosinophils is associated with low endoscopic tracheal mucus scores. These horses are more predisposed to EIPH, poor performance and responded unfavourably to therapy when compared to horses with neutrophilic IAD.
