AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - Paecilomyces, a hyalohyphomycosis, is an uncommon cause of cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Most cases reported have occurred in patients with impaired host defenses or following a surgical procedure, and have proven highly resistant to anti fungal therapies. A 60-year-old man presented with scattered non-healing verrucous lesions as well as ulcers and excoriations on the upper extremities and trunk. The lesion had begun shortly after the patient was scratched by prickly okra. The patient had no underlying health problems and he was on no medication. Histology revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, with papillomatosis with intraepidermal micro-abscess formation. Within the dermis there was a mixed acute and chronic granulomatous infiltrate. With GMS stain numerous pleomorphic yeast forms and pseudohyphael forms were seen. Cultures confirmed Paecilomyces species. The patient was treated with Voriconazole with complete resolution of his lesion. Paecilomyces is an emerging fungal pathogen, which in our immune competent patient manifest as widespread cutaneous disease.

AB  - Porokeratosis is an uncommon cause of clinical change in pigmented lesions. We report two cases of so-called ?collision? lesions, in which the cause of clinical change in melanocytic nevi was porokeratosis. One biopsy was submitted concurrently with a biopsy from another anatomic site, which was a superficial pattern basal cell carcinoma. Both the melanocytic nevus and the basal cell carcinoma contained coronoid lamellae, focal diminution of the granular layer and subjacent dyskeratotic keratinocytes, consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). The melanocytic nevus, from the lower back, was a broad compound melanocytic nevus, associated with elongated, pigmented rete (lentiginous) and small melanocytes in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis (superficial congenital pattern). There was no evidence of external irritation. The second case showed a similar coronoid lamella, focal diminution of the granular layer and dyskeratotic keratinocytes. There was additional parakeratosis away from the parakeratotic column and a lichenoid host response, suggesting external irritation.

AB  - The histopathological changes of herpes simplex, zoster and varicella are considered to be indistinguishable from one another. The clinical setting with adjunctive studies generally clarifies the diagnosis. Vesicular lesions in all 3 conditions can involve epidermal and adnexal epithelium with characteristic cytopathic features. We describe 3 patients with non-vesicular eruptions on the head and neck whose biopsies revealed exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes. All three patients developed typical herpes zoster within days of the biopsy. There is compelling scientific evidence in the literature indicating that, in herpes zoster, the virus is transported from dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia via myelinated nerves to the skin. These terminate at the isthmus of hair follicles and primary infection of follicular and sebaceous epithelium occurs. Secondary spread of infection to the epidermis follows. In contrast, data pertaining to recurrent herpes simplex indicates that axonal transport of the virus from sensory ganglia to the skin is directed primarily to the epidermis, via terminal non-myelinated nerve twigs. The clinical evolution of our 3 cases and scientific data in the literature indicate that exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes, in the setting of a non-vesicular eruption, represents early herpes zoster.

AB  - A 27-day-old female neonate presented with a bleeding growth on the abdomen. The clinical differential diagnosis included pyogenic granuloma and hemangioma. Histology shows an ulcerated, spindled and round cell tumor in the dermis with ill-defined margins that invade the subcutaneous fat. The tumor exhibits a biphasic growth pattern with plump spindled cells arranged in fascicles, as well as epithelioid cells arranged in sheets. Some cells show plasmacytoid features. The tumor cells have pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. Single cell necrosis and mitotic activity is prominent. Myxoid and chondroid stromal changes are focally seen. Immunohistochemical stains show strong positivity for S100 protein, calponin, and, focally, AE1/AE3. Portions of the both the spindled and epithelioid cell components show staining with EMA. Desmin and MSA stains were negative. The tumor does not stain for CD 31, CD 30, CD 45, CD 20, CD 34, CK 20, MART-1, or HMB45. These histologic features are consistent with a cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma. Cutaneous myoepitheliomas are rare tumors of myoepithelial cells which surround eccrine and apocrine glands. While most myoepitheliomas are benign, tumors with high mitotic activity may have a risk for recurrence or metastasis. This is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient described with myoepithelial carcinoma.

AB  - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) may be idiopathic, drug-induced, related to infection, or may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. Our objective was to determine whether tissue eosinophilia is a reliable indicator of a drug-induced etiology in the setting of LCV. Thorough chart investigation of 63 patients with LCV was performed with division of patients into drug-induced and non-drug-induced groups. Corresponding histopathologic material was reviewed by a dermatopathologist blinded to the etiologic associations.? An eosinophil score was tabulated by averaging the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (400x) and dividing by the density of inflammation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin rank sums test. Mean eosinophil scores in the drug-induced (n?=?16) and non-drug-induced (n?=?47) groups were 5.20 and 1.05 respectively (p?=?0.0126). Vascular fibrin deposition and epidermal changes were present in both groups. Clinical evidence of systemic vasculitis was present in 6%(1/16) of the drug-induced group vs. 38%(18/47) of the non-drug-induced cases. This study establishes tissue eosinophilia as a reliable indicator of drug induction in the setting of LCV. Furthermore, this information may be useful for guiding management decisions, especially in settings of unclear etiology.

AB  - BRAF encodes a serine-threonine kinase, which acts in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway transducing regulatory signals from RAS to MEK1/2. Somatic mutations in BRAF have been identified in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi. More than 90% of these mutations consist of a valine to glutamate substitution at codon 599 (V599E) of exon 15. While a high prevalence of BRAF mutations in common melanocytic nevi has been reported in adults, nevi in children have not been studied. Of interest, we have previously shown that Spitz nevi in children do not harbor mutations in BRAF. To investigate the association of BRAF mutations with patient age, we studied common melanocytic nevi in children for the V599E activating mutation. Tumor cells were microdissected from 6 common melanocytic nevi in children 10 years of age or younger, and analyzed for the V599E mutation in BRAF by allele-specific PCR and gel electrophoresis. In 6 of 6 (100%) nevi, the V599E mutant allele was observed. Our data suggest that similar genetic pathways are involved in the development of common melanocytic nevi in children and adults. The absence of BRAF mutations in Spitz nevi in children is therefore associated with tumor type, not patient age.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common primary cutaneous carcinomas, but on rare occasion, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a distant site or solid organ can present as a cutaneous lesion. Most metastases to the skin present as dermal nodules or involve the dermal lymphatics, but when they are intimately associated with the epidermis, distinguishing the lesion as primary or metastatic may be extremely difficult and usually requires a clinical history or high index of suspicion. A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of breast carcinoma, status post radiation therapy and subsequent mastectomy. She developed multiple eruptive nodules over her mastectomy site, flank and back two years later. Histologically the lesions appeared to be arising from the surface epidermis and consisted of atypical, predominantly spindle cells, some of which streamed off of the basal layer of the epidermis. Following review of the mastectomy specimen material and performing additional immunohistochemical studies, it became clear that the origin of the carcinomas was metastatic from an underlying metaplastic breast carcinoma.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - p63, a recently identified homologue of p53 gene, has been reported to be essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms versus adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis using p63 monoclonal antibody (clone 4A4) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 10 malignant adnexal tumors, and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) benign adnexal tumors showed strong p63 expression; the remaining 7(35%) cases had over 50% p63-positive nuclei. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive for p63 (p?<?0.0001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN) is a rare hamartomatous malformation of the eccrine duct which typically presents at birth or early in life. Multiple punctate pits and verrucous papules and plaques with nonfollicular hyperkeratotic spines are seen over the palms and soles and may extend to the distal extremities. A linear distribution may be present. A wide range of involvement has been reported in the literature, including bilateral systematized involvement. No systemic involvement has been linked to PEODDN to date. Histologic findings are characteristic and include a dilated eccrine acrosyringium with an overlying parakeratotic column or cornoid lamella. There is slight dyskeratosis and loss of the granular layer under the cornoid lamella. Here, we present a case of bilateral systematized PEODDN in an otherwise healthy, 18 year-old Hispanic female. Physical examination is notable for marked hypoplasia of the left breast with overlying verrucous papules and plaques. Multiple punch biopsies were performed and showed findings diagnostic of PEODDN. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive involvement of PEODDN reported in the literature to date and the only case with associated hypoplasia of the breast.

AB  - Clear cell hidradenoma is a benign eccrine tumor with nodular-cystic architecture, ductal differentiation and poroid cytology. Squamous islands occurring in eccrine neoplasms are classified into three types, according to their location, histologic characteristics and degrees of cellular atypia. Type I squamous islands resemble normal epidermis and are present in the superficial to middle portion of eccrine poromas. Type II squamous islands are localised in the deeper portion of eccrine poromas and show lumen formation suggestive of acrosyringeal differentiation. Type III squamous islands show atypical features and are limited to malignant eccrine tumors. A 55-year-old man was biopsied for a dermal nodule on his left arm. The initial shave biopsy revealed the surface of an intradermal cystic nodule with numerous whorls and horn pearls of squamatization, reminiscent?of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; however, no cytologic atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity were identified; focal clear cell and ductal differentiation were also present. Complete excision revealed clear cell hidradenoma with extensive mixed type I and type II squamous islands. The presence of whorls and pearls of squamoid cells is a rare finding in clear cell hidradenoma that, moreover, in the setting of a superficial biopsy, may be a diagnostic pitfall.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.

Results: There were 356 biopsies from 328 patients (ages 6 to 93 years (mean?=?31), female: male?=?255:101, time to recurrence 1?63 months (mean?=?7.85)). Sites: back (170), abdomen (46), arm (46), leg (34), head and neck (26), chest (26), and buttock (8). Initial biopsies: 208 nevi, 142 dysplastic nevi, 1 blue, 1 pigmented spindle cell, 2 Spitz nevi, and 2 melanomas in situ. 3 patterns of recurrence were observed: 1) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with epidermal effacement and scar, 2) compound melanocytic proliferation with epidermal effacement and scar, and 3) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with retained retiform epidermis. Recurrent and residual nevi had similar proliferation rates. Conclusion: Recurrent nevi occurred more commonly in females and on the trunk. Cytologic atypia, asymmetry, and retention of retiform epidermis were worrisome histologic features. Clinical history, effacement of the epidermis and limitation of changes to the scar, distinguished recurrence from melanoma. Low proliferation rate may be a useful adjunct to distinguish recurrent nevi from melanoma.

AB  - Although cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) may show divergent differentiation including tubular/glandular, squamous, eccrine, and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, a diffuse glandular pattern is exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a case of MCC with prominent tubulo-glandular differentiation, which precluded a definitive diagnosis in the initial punch biopsy. The patient was a 43 year-old male with 5?6 weeks history of a rapidly growing plaque at his back. A punch biopsy revealed an infiltrating lesion consisting of tubulo-glandular structures lined by hyperchromatic basaloid cells, along with some angulated, basaloid tumor nests embedded in a desmoplastic stroma. Immunostains revealed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for chromogranin and BerEP4, variably positive for CK7 and CK5/6, but negative for CK20, synaptophysin, S-100, EMA, GCDFP-15, ER/PR, TTF1 and CEA. The reexcision specimen showed multifocal epidermotropism and typical finely stippled nuclear chromatin. Although the lack of CK20 staining is unusual, the histologic characteristics along with the remaining immunohistochemical studies favor the diagnosis of a primary cutaneous neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (MCC) over the variants of microcystic adnexal carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Our case illustrates that prominent glandular differentiation may occur in MCC, and sometime create difficulty in definitive diagnosis in small biopsy specimen.

AB  - We report a case of inflammatory stage vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicans (LSA) with histopathologic features simulating both patch stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and extramammary Paget?s disease. The patient is a 79-year-old woman with an erythematous plaque on her vulva. A punch biopsy was performed that revealed mild psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis with spongiosis, marked interface vacuolar alteration, scattered individual necrotic keratinocytes and Civatte bodies. A band-like mixed inflammatory infiltrate was present in the papillary/upper dermis with prominent intraepidermal lymphocytes. Some intraepidermal lymphocytes showed atypical nuclear contours simulating the cells seen in MF. The presence of numerous intraepidermal epithelioid cells with a pagetoid distribution raised the possibility of extramammary Paget?s disease. A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains showed a reactive lichenoid mixed population of lymphocytes with numerous intraepidermal Langerhans cells. This confirmed the diagnosis of the inflammatory stage of lichen sclerosus. The presence of prominent epithelioid Langerhans cells with activated small lymphocytes represents an immune response in LSA and could cause diagnostic confusion with neoplastic conditions. IHC staining can confirm cell type and rule out MF and extramammary Paget?s disease.

AB  - The histology of melanocytic nevi in elderly patients often differs from nevi in younger adults. Our hypothesis was that nevi in patients3 60?yrs would demonstrate histologic patterns different from nevi in younger adults. Biopsies of nevi (n?=?214) from 172 patients3 60?yrs (mean age 69?±?7?yrs) were examined by three dermatopathologists and a consensus diagnosis was rendered. Control specimens (n?=?82) from 58 patients 20?40?yrs (mean age 31?±?5?yrs) were evaluated. Compound melanocytic nevi were commoner in younger patients (37%) versus older patients (12%)(p?<?.0001). Junctional melanocytic nevi were more frequently diagnosed in older patients (10% versus 3%; p?=?.027) and a lentiginous, often heavily pigmented, growth pattern was common (12% of nevi) vs control group (3%; p?=?.028). Atypical (?dysplastic?) nevi had a similar frequency at all ages, however 12/214 nevi in elderly patients (6%) exhibited marked atypia with features suggesting melanoma in-situ. We conclude that benign junctional nevi are relatively common in elderly patients and that a lentiginous, heavily pigmented growth pattern, typically associated with younger patients, is often seen in both junctional and compound nevi in this older age group. This pattern must be differentiated from dysplastic nevus and melanoma in-situ, which they may clinically resemble.
