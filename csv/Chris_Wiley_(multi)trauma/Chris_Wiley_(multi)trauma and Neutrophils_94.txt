AB  - Background: Drotrecogin alfa activated (DrotAA) is licensed for treatment of patients with severe sepsis and organ failure. Among the latter, acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as the persistence of oligo-anuria following adequate resuscitation, is one of the most apprehended. We conducted a prospective, observational, and controlled study to test the hypothesis that DrotAA beneficially affected the evolution and outcome of AKI, complicating acute sepsis-induced cardiopulmonary failure. Methods: Forty-six patients were studied. Thirty subjects received standard treatment for sepsis without DrotAA. In the remaining 16 patients, DrotAA was added as a continuous infusion of 24??g/kg/h for 96?h. Results: Mean age, causes of sepsis, and severity/organ failure scores were comparable between patients treated with or without DrotAA. Mortality at 28 days was high and comparable between both treatment groups (56% vs. 69%, DrotAA vs. no DrotAA; P=0.5). When oligo-anuria was present at the start of the study, it persisted during treatment in all patients, with no significant difference between groups. Both treatment groups presented with baseline mean daily fractional excretion of sodium values >2% that remained high during the observation period, regardless of whether DrotAA was given or not. Kidney histology showed a preserved renal architecture with tubular necrosis in all specimens. Similar glomerular, tubulo-interstitial, and vascular alterations were present in both treatment groups. Conclusion: In this small cohort of patients with severe sepsis who received adjuvant DrotAA treatment, no effect on urine output, tubular function, or mortality could be demonstrated.

AB  - Abstract The skin is a highly complex organ, responsible for sensation, protection against the environment (pollutants, foreign proteins, infection) and thereby linked to the immune and sensory systems in the neuro-immuno-cutaneous (NIC) system. Cutaneous innervation is a key part of the peripheral nervous system; therefore, the skin should be considered a sensory organ and an important part of the central nervous system, an ?active interface? and the first connection of the body to the outside world. Peripheral nerves are a complex class of neurons within these systems, subsets of functions are conducted, including mechanoreception, nociception and thermoception. Epidermal and dermal cells produce signalling factors (such as cytokines or growth factors), neurites influence skin cells (such as via neuropeptides), and peripheral nerves have a role in both early and late stages of the inflammatory response. One way this is achieved, specifically in the cutaneous system, is through neuropeptide release and signalling, especially via substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Cutaneous, neuronal and immune cells play a central role in many conditions, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, UV-induced immunosuppression, herpes and lymphomas. Therefore, it is critical to understand the connections and interplay between the peripheral nervous system and the skin and immune systems, the NIC system. Relevant in vitro tissue models based on human skin equivalents can be used to gain insight and to address impact across research and clinical needs.

AB  - Abstract A thoracic percutaneous lead system was designed for use in present and future cardiac research in Biomedical Engineering. The lead system was fabricated of Teflon and silicone rubber and was implanted at the junction of the middle and upper third of the left sixth intercostal space of 24 mongrel dogs and observed for variable periods of time. Minimal inflammation was elicited in the skin and subcutis of 17 dogs, but infection and other complications developed in 7 dogs. The reaction of the ribs to the Teflon conduit was characterized by extensive periosteal new bone formation. The pulmonary and pleural reaction to silicone rubber tubing was also studied.

AB  - Summary The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines and receptors is unique in immunology because the IL-1 family and Toll-like receptor (TLR) families share similar functions. More than any other cytokine family, the IL-1 family is primarily associated with innate immunity. More than 95% of living organisms use innate immune mechanisms for survival whereas less than 5% depend on T- and B-cell functions. Innate immunity is manifested by inflammation, which can function as a mechanism of host defense but when uncontrolled is detrimental to survival. Each member of the IL-1 receptor and TLR family contains the cytoplasmic Toll-IL-1-Receptor (TIR) domain. The 50 amino acid TIR domains are highly homologous with the Toll protein in Drosophila. The TIR domain is nearly the same and present in each TLR and each IL-1 receptor family. Whereas IL-1 family cytokine members trigger innate inflammation via IL-1 family of receptors, TLRs trigger inflammation via bacteria, microbial products, viruses, nucleic acids, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In fact, IL-1 family member IL-1a and IL-33 also function as DAMPs. Although the inflammatory properties of the IL-1 family dominate in innate immunity, IL-1 family member can play a role in acquired immunity. This overview is a condensed update of the IL-1 family of cytokines and receptors.
