AB  - Abstract The skin is a highly complex organ, responsible for sensation, protection against the environment (pollutants, foreign proteins, infection) and thereby linked to the immune and sensory systems in the neuro-immuno-cutaneous (NIC) system. Cutaneous innervation is a key part of the peripheral nervous system; therefore, the skin should be considered a sensory organ and an important part of the central nervous system, an ?active interface? and the first connection of the body to the outside world. Peripheral nerves are a complex class of neurons within these systems, subsets of functions are conducted, including mechanoreception, nociception and thermoception. Epidermal and dermal cells produce signalling factors (such as cytokines or growth factors), neurites influence skin cells (such as via neuropeptides), and peripheral nerves have a role in both early and late stages of the inflammatory response. One way this is achieved, specifically in the cutaneous system, is through neuropeptide release and signalling, especially via substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Cutaneous, neuronal and immune cells play a central role in many conditions, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, UV-induced immunosuppression, herpes and lymphomas. Therefore, it is critical to understand the connections and interplay between the peripheral nervous system and the skin and immune systems, the NIC system. Relevant in vitro tissue models based on human skin equivalents can be used to gain insight and to address impact across research and clinical needs.

AB  - Summary Release of radioactivity, either intended or not, is an undeniable possibility and potentially catastrophic. Reports of nuclear proliferation in nations unfriendly to the United States and the Western world, and the poisoning of a Russian dissident with polonium-210 are further reminders of the terrorist threat. Healthcare needs for displaced populations can easily overwhelm the infrastructure in regions immediately surrounding a disaster area. People exposed to high levels of radiation usually >1?2 Gy over a short period of time may develop acute radiation syndrome. Administering myeloid cytokines to appropriately selected victims offers potential benefits after a mass casualty radiation incident. Consortiums such as the Radiation Injury Treatment Network are engaged in services such as developing treatment guidelines for managing hematologic toxicity among victims of radiation exposure. Similarly, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) is establishing a network to offer training courses and improve cooperation between institutions.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a basic understanding of clinically relevant CNS infections. It presents the background, prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, special populations, prognosis, reading list, guidelines, and evidence for CNS infections. Infections of the nervous system include meningitis (inflammation of the meninges), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain parenchyma), and abscess (a focal, encapsulated infection). The chapter explores the etiologies, presentation, and diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis. It discusses the various causes of brain abscesses, their presentation, and treatment. Dexamethasone is used for pneumococcal meningitis to prevent hearing impairment. Patients with M. tuberculosis meningitis with suspected pulmonary involvement or potential to aerosolize are to be placed on airborne isolation. When disseminated varicella zoster is suspected, including CNS disease, contact and airborne precautions are recommended. Hospital personnel in contact with the patient must be immune to varicella.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.
