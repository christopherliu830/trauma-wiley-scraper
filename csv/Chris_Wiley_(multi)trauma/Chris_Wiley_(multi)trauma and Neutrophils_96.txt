AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations are increased in dogs with exertional rhabdomyolysis and whether concentrations are correlated with serum myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity. Design Observational cohort study. Setting Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race 2015. Animals Twelve normal competitive sled dogs; 5 dogs with rhabdomyolysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Blood was collected from all confirmed cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis and compared to the winning team at the midrace point. Results indicate that median cfDNA did not increase, but decreased by the race finish (prerace = 314.2 ng/mL versus midrace = 283.7 ng/mL versus postrace = 249.5 ng/mL). There were no rises in median cfDNA in dogs with rhabdomyolysis (255 ng/mL) negating its potential utility as a measure of acute skeletal muscle compromise. In contrast, myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity at the midrace point for normal dogs were significantly lower than dogs with rhabdomyolysis. Values for myoglobin and creatine kinase were strongly positively correlated (R = 0.91). Conclusions cfDNA is not a useful biomarker for exertional rhabdomyolysis in contrast to myoglobin and creatine kinase. Further evaluation of timing and clinical signs suggests that exertional rhabdomyolysis occurs early in endurance activities. Among the dogs with rhabdomyolysis, the dog that demonstrated clinical signs had the highest serum creatine kinase activity and myoglobin concentration.

AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - Summary? The search for a tissue adhesive which obviates the need for suture materials in the apposition of wound edges is not new. The early adhesive products lacked the required safety and efficacy. Experimental use of a new fibrin adhesive has shown that it may have potential use where inflammatory reaction to the suture material is undesirable or water-tight sealing of the anastomosis is required.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.
