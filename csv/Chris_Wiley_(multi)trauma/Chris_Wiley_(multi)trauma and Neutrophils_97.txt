AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on spontaneous conditions seen in conventionally raised mice, conditions that often differ from those seen in laboratory mice. Mycoplasma pulmonis, an important agent of chronic murine respiratory disease, has been eradicated largely from laboratory mouse colonies but remains a very important infection of mice raised and housed under conventional conditions. Subclinical infections are common with M. pulmonis, and signs may not manifest until late in the course of the disease. Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are two different mouse paramyxoviruses that historically have been very important as causes of murine respiratory disease in laboratory settings. Enteric parasitic infections are common in pet and wild mice. Good hygiene, good nutrition, and colony management can help to reduce the severity of signs seen because infections are transmitted by ingestion of eggs, infective cysts, or larvae found in the environment.

AB  - Abstract Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine. The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull. The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot. Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma.

AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.

AB  - A major question in research on immune responses in the brain is how the timing and nature of these responses influence physiology, pathogenesis or recovery from pathogenic processes. Proper understanding of the immune regulation of the human brain requires a detailed description of the function and activities of the immune cells in the brain. Zebrafish larvae allow long-term, noninvasive imaging inside the brain at high-spatiotemporal resolution using fluorescent transgenic reporters labeling specific cell populations. Together with recent additional technical advances this allows an unprecedented versatility and scope of future studies. Modeling of human physiology and pathology in zebrafish has already yielded relevant insights into cellular dynamics and function that can be translated to the human clinical situation. For instance, in vivo studies in the zebrafish have provided new insight into immune cell dynamics in granuloma formation in tuberculosis and the mechanisms involving treatment resistance. In this review, we highlight recent findings and novel tools paving the way for basic neuroimmunology research in the zebrafish. GLIA 2015;63:719?735

AB  - The radiographic appearance of nodular fat necrosis is described in ten cats and one dog. The most common radiographic sign was the presence of a focal mineralized circular to oval soft tissue mass in the abdominal fat as present in 9 cats. These masses had a distinct eggshell-like rim encapsulating the lesion. In one cat and one dog multiple masses were present, without radiographic signs of mineralization. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in three cats and one dog, findings included the presence of hyperechoic masses with associated acoustic shadowing, some with a hypoechoic centre. Almost all animals were old and obese. In three cats and one dog, changes were confirmed with biopsy or post mortem examination. Lesions having the appearance of those in this paper are most likely incidental findings and should not be confused with abdominal masses of neoplastic origin. Ultrasound can be helpful in identifying such lesions.

AB  - Summary Dogs and cats, like all other mammals, have a variety of bacteria that normally inhabit their skin surface. This chapter discusses bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcal bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the Staphylococcus species found on the dog. Staphylococcus schlieferi and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause canine and feline pyodermas. The chapter then provides a discussion on clinical features, diagnostic tests, and treatment for surface pyodermas, superficial pyodermas, and deep pyodermas. It is important that clients understand the secondary nature of bacterial skin infections. Patients with recurrent or chronic skin infections who have received multiple courses of antibiotics are at increased risk for methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. Diagnosis and control of the underlying disease are essential in the management and prevention of these bacterial infections. Most clients want to be actively involved in their pet's treatment, and the veterinary staff must listen to and address their concerns as early as possible.
