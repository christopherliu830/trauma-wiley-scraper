AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - The radiographic appearance of nodular fat necrosis is described in ten cats and one dog. The most common radiographic sign was the presence of a focal mineralized circular to oval soft tissue mass in the abdominal fat as present in 9 cats. These masses had a distinct eggshell-like rim encapsulating the lesion. In one cat and one dog multiple masses were present, without radiographic signs of mineralization. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in three cats and one dog, findings included the presence of hyperechoic masses with associated acoustic shadowing, some with a hypoechoic centre. Almost all animals were old and obese. In three cats and one dog, changes were confirmed with biopsy or post mortem examination. Lesions having the appearance of those in this paper are most likely incidental findings and should not be confused with abdominal masses of neoplastic origin. Ultrasound can be helpful in identifying such lesions.

AB  - A major question in research on immune responses in the brain is how the timing and nature of these responses influence physiology, pathogenesis or recovery from pathogenic processes. Proper understanding of the immune regulation of the human brain requires a detailed description of the function and activities of the immune cells in the brain. Zebrafish larvae allow long-term, noninvasive imaging inside the brain at high-spatiotemporal resolution using fluorescent transgenic reporters labeling specific cell populations. Together with recent additional technical advances this allows an unprecedented versatility and scope of future studies. Modeling of human physiology and pathology in zebrafish has already yielded relevant insights into cellular dynamics and function that can be translated to the human clinical situation. For instance, in vivo studies in the zebrafish have provided new insight into immune cell dynamics in granuloma formation in tuberculosis and the mechanisms involving treatment resistance. In this review, we highlight recent findings and novel tools paving the way for basic neuroimmunology research in the zebrafish. GLIA 2015;63:719?735

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate microbiological and histopathological features of canine acral lick dermatitis (ALD). Microbial characteristics of ALD are poorly described in current literature. If infection is recognized, antimicrobial selection is usually empirical, based on appearance, cytology or surface culture, rather than deep tissue culture. It was hypothesized that cultures obtained from deep tissue would yield different results than predicted by surface culture and cytology, and that isolates from ALD have unpredictable susceptibility patterns showing resistance to antibiotics routinely administered for canine pyoderma. Biopsies were obtained from 31 lesions and submitted for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal culture, and histopathological evaluation. Surface aerobic culture and susceptibility and cytology were obtained for comparison in 22 dogs. Skin scrapings and dermatophyte culture were performed. Bacteria were isolated in 30 of 31 cases. Staphylococcus intermedius was isolated in 58% of deep cultures. Twenty per cent of deep isolates were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species. Forty-eight per cent of cases yielded organisms defined as multidrug resistant on deep culture. Only 57% and 55% of bacteria isolated from tissue culture were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefazolin, respectively. Cytology and superficial cultures did not correlate well with deep cultures. Surface culture predicted deep tissue isolates in eight of 22 cases. Microsporum gypseum was isolated from one dog. Histopathological features included acanthosis, follicular elongation, lymphoplasmacytic dermal inflammation, folliculitis, furunculosis, perihidradenitis, hidradenitis and vertical streaking fibrosis. Lesions associated with ALD warrant tissue bacterial cultures as the majority of cases yielded positive growth of bacteria differing from superficial culture and often resistant to empirical drugs.

AB  - Abstract Introduction:? Previous studies have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels correlated with mortality in critically ill patients. Goal:? To determine the effect of ketamine on IL-6 levels in liver resections patients with a temporary porto-arterial occlusion (Pringle manoeuvre). Materials and methods:? Controlled, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. One group (n?=?21) received ketamine whereas the other group (n?=?17) received placebo. IL-6 levels were obtained at baseline, 4, 12, 24?h, 3 and 5 days. Results:? There were no significant differences in IL-6 levels between the groups (basal P?=?089, 4?h P?=?0.83, 12?h P?=?0.39, 24?h, P?=?0.55, 3 days P?=?0.80 and 5 days P?=?0.45). Both groups had elevated IL-6 levels that became almost undetectable by day 5. There was no major morbidity and no mortality in either group. Conclusions:? Ketamine does not seem to have an effect on plasma levels of IL-6. This could be interpreted as a potential finding associated with outcome as we did not encounter any deaths or major complications. Further studies will likely be needed to determine the range of IL-6 levels associated with survival and mortality, and whether it could be a predictor of survival.

AB  - Summary Platelets play a key role in primary hemostasis. After injury, exposed subendothelium interacts with platelets to activate them through a series of steps including adhesion, aggregation, and the release reaction. Activated platelets in conjunction with the coagulation system form a stable plug to control hemorrhage. Numerous inherited and acquired conditions can lead to platelet dysfunction with variable bleeding. Although rare, the pathophysiologic basis of inherited platelet disorders is better understood than that of the more prevalent acquired conditions. This chapter briefly reviews the structure and function of normal platelets, discusses the various diagnostic tests available to evaluate platelet function, describes some of the more common inherited and acquired qualitative platelet disorders, and provides an overview of their treatment.

AB  - Abstract Alginate-based biomaterials can form naturally derived polymeric hydrogels with sufficient structural integrity to readily be used in many clinical applications. However, ionically cross-linked alginate gels do not always possess structural properties suitable for application as erodable polymeric films for controlled release of drugs and growth factors. In this study, semi-rigid polymeric films were constructed of sodium alginate and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by means of a rehydration cross-linking technique. The films were assembled by dehydrating a solution of alginate and PEG and cross-linking the alginate during its rehydration with a solution of calcium chloride. The product is a highly dense polymeric network that prevents in vivo cellular infiltration and disassembles primarily by surface erosion. By implanting the PEG-alginate films into the subcutis of rats, the mechanism of polymer degradation was demonstrated to occur via inflammation-mediated erosion of the material rather than by means of cellular infiltration. There were extensive areas of foamy macrophages at the site of the implant, indicating a likely mechanism of removal and disposal of the disassembled PEG and alginate polymer. The eroded fragments of the film that remained after six weeks did not exhibit signs of a cellular infiltrate but rather stayed intact, appearing as small, dense fragments of polymer. Our observations that nearly all the PEG-alginate material was cleared from the implantation site by the sixth postoperative week highlight the potential exploitation of these films as bioresorbable wound dressings with prospective utilization as a drug delivery device. Moreover, the employment of polymeric films made of functionalized PEG, which enables covalent attachment of biological molecules, potentiates their use for growth factor delivery applications.
