AB  - We investigated the association of scavenger receptor A-positive (SRA+) cells in peripheral blood (PB) with mortality in subjects with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A total of 467 subjects with SIRS (62 of 467 satisfied the diagnostic criteria of MODS) were prospectively examined. The subjects were classified into three groups according to the SRA index (number of small SRA+ cells in 10 high power field, normal upper limit <30) and the appearance of large SRA+ cells as follows: group A, large SRA+ cells were not detected; group B, large SRA+ cells were detected but SRA index did not exceed 30; group C, the two factors (appearance of large SRA+ cells and SRA index >30) coincided. The duration from the diagnosis of SIRS to death in groups A and B was significantly shorter than in group C. The mortality rate in group C was significantly higher than in groups A and B. Kaplan-Meier curves of group C showed significantly worse survival than groups A and B. These results indicate that the coincidence of two factors (appearance of large SRA+ cells and SRA index >30) may be useful to predict the outcome in patients with SIRS or MODS.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Objectives Prior studies demonstrated that plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, plasma glucose and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, the components of plasma osmolality, have been shown to be an important contributor for in-hospital mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) patients. Hence, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of plasma osmolality upon admission with in-hospital mortality in patients with APE. Methods A total of 245 consecutive intermediate or high risk APE patients were enrolled into the study. The study population was divided into three tertile groups (T1, T2 and T3) based on the increased plasma osmolality. The in-hospital mortality was the primary end-point. Results After adjusting for all risk factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the T3 group compared to T1 and T2 groups (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3 to 18.8, P < .001). In addition, the incidence of asystolia, hypotension and cardiogenic shock were significantly higher in the T3 group. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of plasma osmolality for the in-hospital mortality was 0.76 with sensitivity 67.2% and specificity 74.1% 95% CI: (0.66-0.87, P < .001). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated levels of plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in APE patients. Our findings are novel and deserve further studies whether the treatment of higher plasma osmolality may reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality in APE patients.

AB  - Summary Platelets play a key role in primary hemostasis. After injury, exposed subendothelium interacts with platelets to activate them through a series of steps including adhesion, aggregation, and the release reaction. Activated platelets in conjunction with the coagulation system form a stable plug to control hemorrhage. Numerous inherited and acquired conditions can lead to platelet dysfunction with variable bleeding. Although rare, the pathophysiologic basis of inherited platelet disorders is better understood than that of the more prevalent acquired conditions. This chapter briefly reviews the structure and function of normal platelets, discusses the various diagnostic tests available to evaluate platelet function, describes some of the more common inherited and acquired qualitative platelet disorders, and provides an overview of their treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) within red blood cells (RBC) is protected from oxidative processes by enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants as well as the RBC membrane that provides a physical barrier against oxidation. When Hb is introduced into the circulation as a result of hemolysis or following infusion of Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs; ?blood substitutes?), the control of oxidative processes becomes dependent on plasma oxidative status. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that Hb and HBOCs undergo oxidative modification at the site of heme iron and at multiple amino acid sites as a result of autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation. Recent findings from in vitro studies provide a strong basis for understanding of potential toxicity in vivo. The antioxidative status of both plasma and tissue becomes an important factor in the control of Hb and HBOC oxidation and nitrosylation in the circulation. Several studies that performed ex vivo and in vivo have demonstrated a critical role for plasma antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and uric acid in maintaining Hb and HBOCs in functional non-oxidized states. In the present review we discuss mechanisms of Hb and HBOC autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we explore the role(s) of plasma antioxidants in maintaining functional HBOC status that may potentially be exploited as part of protective strategies against Hb and HBOC oxidative toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Muscle atrophy results in severe functional impairment and is a significant clinical problem. We examined and characterized the therapeutic effects of autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) using an in vivo muscle atrophy rat model. To identify the effect of injected ADSCs into muscle, we developed the following two models of muscle atrophy in rats: induction of denervation by sciatic nerve defects; and nerve repair after severing the sciatic nerve. The inguinal fat pads were harvested from each rat and autologous ADSCs were cultured and ADSCs were injected in the right hind limbs as the experimental group, while normal saline was injected in the left hind limbs, which served as the control group. After 2 weeks, gross examination and histologic analyses were performed. Additionally, to investigate the survival of ADSCs in muscle tissues, we traced the injected ADSCs. The fate of injected ADSCs into muscle was investigated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging method with lentivirus transfection. The muscle weight and cross-sectional area of muscle were greater and proliferation of connective tissue was less prominent in the ADSC-injected group. Alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the neuromuscular junction was significantly increased, and neoangiogenesis was higher in the ADSCs-injected group. green fluorescent protein-labeled ADSCs survived in the gastrocnemius muscle after 2 weeks. These findings could give a support in finding the role of autologous ADSCs as new therapeutic modality for regeneration of atrophied muscle.
