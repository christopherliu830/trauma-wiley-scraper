AB  - Abstract Perception of our environment entirely depends on the close interaction between the central and peripheral nervous system. In order to communicate each other, both systems must develop in parallel and in coordination. During development, axonal projections from the CNS as well as the PNS must extend over large distances to reach their appropriate target cells. To do so, they read and follow a series of axon guidance molecules. Interestingly, while these molecules play critical roles in guiding developing axons, they have also been shown to be critical in other major neurodevelopmental processes, such as the migration of cortical progenitors. Currently, a major hurdle for brain repair after injury or neurodegeneration is the absence of axonal regeneration in the mammalian CNS. By contrasts, PNS axons can regenerate. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain this paradox but recent studies suggest that hacking neurodevelopmental mechanisms may be the key to promote CNS regeneration. Here we provide a seminar report written by trainees attending the second Flagship school held in Alpbach, Austria in September 2018 organized by the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) together with the Journal of Neurochemistry (JCN). This advanced school has brought together leaders in the fields of neurodevelopment and regeneration in order to discuss major keystones and future challenges in these respective fields.

AB  - Research on abnormal scarring, such as excessive scars, has been hampered by the lack of relevant animal models. Recent studies suggest that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are stimulators of fibrosis or scarring. We developed a rabbit ear cutaneous excessive scarring model using the growth factor stimulators TGF-?1 (0.25, 0.5 or 1??g per wound), PDGF-BB (1, 2 or 3??g per wound) and FGF-2 (0.5, 1, 3 or 5??g per wound). Three 8-mm diameter wounds were created on each ear in NZW rabbits (n?=?6 wounds). The test growth factors were injected intradermally immediately after wounding. Controls consisted of PBS, BSA and wounding only without injections. Scar thickness of wounds was measured with a micrometer at days 14 and continued twice a week thereafter until sacrifice at day 28. Results showed that the greatest measurement of elevated scars was observed at day 14. Significant differences of scar thickness were observed in TGF-?1 at a dose of 0.25??g, PDGF-BB at a dose of 3??g, and FGF-2 at a dose of 3??g per wound groups when compared to PBS and wounding only groups (p?<?0.05). Interestingly, BSA, a protein stabilizer for TGF-?1 and FGF-2 proteins, also significantly elevated scar thickness at day 14 over PBS alone (p?<?0.05). Trichrome stained tissue sections on day 28 showed an increase in cellularity and thicker epithelium in all doses of TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 protein treated groups when compared to wounding only, PBS or BSA treatments. In general, FGF-2 treated wounds showed more vascularity than TGF-?1 and PDGF-BB treated wounds. By contrast, PDGF-BB treated wounds showed richer collagen deposition than TGF-?1 and FGF-2 treated wounds. Results from these studies demonstrated that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 contributed to the scar formation in the rabbit ear scar model. BSA may contribute in stimulating scar formation in the early stage of wound healing in this model. Enhancing elevated scar formation in the rabbit ear model will be useful in evaluating anti-scarring agents for excessive scars such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.

AB  - The complexity of cellular and molecular events that occur during wound healing is given by the rapid and continuous changes of matrix structure, cell population, local cytokine composition, nutrient and oxygen availabilities and overall metabolic activity. Angiogenesis is an essential event in the repair of injured tissue. Transcriptional events leading to wound neovascularization begin immediately after the injury has occurred and continue throughout the process until scar remodeling becomes quiescent. This study investigated progression of wound angiogenesis by quantitatively measuring transcripts of multiple genes that participate in wound angiogenesis. The studies were done using a murine model of bilateral 3?mm excision wounds. Wound tissues were collected from 6 hours up to 10 days post-wounding. Each time point consisted of 8 wounds pooled from four different mice. After RNA purification, the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probe/primer sets for selected transcripts that included the following groups: a) angiogenic factors; b) anti-angiogenic factors; c) receptors; d) cytokines and enzymes; e) matrix proteins; f) signaling molecules and transcription factors; g) apoptosis and proliferation markers; and h) housekeeping genes. A total of 58 genes were profiled including four housekeeping genes. The transcripts revealed several patterns of expression. Some genes such as angiopoietin 1(Ang1), e-selecting, placental growth factor (PlGF), MMP-9 and thrombospondin 1(TSP1) had a clear biphasic pattern where early peaks were detected within the first 24 hours after wounding and were followed by dowregulation and a second increase in transcription after several days. Other transcripts appeared early and had a sustained expression and they include fibroblast growth factor two (FGF2), FGF7, hypoxia inducile factor alpha (HIF-1a) and STAT3. Examples of late transcripts included HOXD3 and alpha smooth muscle actin. Results derived from this study largely confirm previous studies profiling a small number of individual genes such as VEGF, TSP1 and 2 and others. However, the present study integrates complete transcriptional profiles of large number of genes known to have a critical role in healing progression with a particular emphasis on revascularization. A more detailed model of event sequences that lead to tissue reperfusion after injury is derived from the results.

AB  - Many silver-dressings have been recently developed to prevent infection of burn and chronic wounds. Antimicrobial therapies are usually studied in in-vitro assays, which evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy against free-floating bacteria. In a wound environment bacteria attach to tissues and establish bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are communities of colonies of bacteria and other microorganisms encased in a self produced exopolymeric substance. Biofilms help protect the bacteria from the environment and limit the effectiveness of antimicrobials. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of two silver dressings to eradicate biofilm-associated and planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using our biofilm burn wound animal model. Three pigs were used in this study. Second-degree burn wounds were made on one-half of the animal?s back and inoculated with a burn wound isolate of P. aeruginosa. These wounds were then covered for 72 hours with a polyurethane dressing to allow biofilm formation. After 72 hours, additional burn wounds were made on the unwounded half of the animal. The new burns were then inoculated with the same P. aeruginosa strain. At this 72 hour point we had established two bacterial groups, one side of the animal had burns with planktonic bacteria and the other half with biofilm bacteria. Both sides of the animal were treated 20 minutes after inoculation of the planktonic group with the following dressings: 1) Nanocrystalline Silver, 2) Hydrocolloid Silver, or 3) untreated. Wounds were cultured from all treatment groups at 24, 48 and 72 hours post treatment. Sites were cultured quantitatively using a novel flush-scrub technique to obtain both planktonic and biofilm bacterial counts. The baseline biofilm bacterial count was 7.56 LogCFU/ml (prior to treatment). The hydrocolloid dressing significantly reduced planktonic bacteria counts as compared to untreated and nanocrystalline silver dressing at 24, 48 and 72 hours. However, biofilm bacteria counts for both dressings were similar to untreated control at all sample points. Our study demonstrates that both silver dressings showed limited effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated cells when compared to untreated wounds. Based on our results we question the effectiveness of silver dressings for infected wounds that are colonized with biofilm associated-cells. We conclude that anti-biofilm susceptibility models may improve on current antimicrobial sensitivity assays.

AB  - Biofilms are a combination of microorganisms and extrapolysaccharide matrices. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that biofilms are present in both acute and chronic wounds. Once biofilms are established, phagocytosis and diffusion of antibiotics are impaired thus contributing to antimicrobial resistance due to increased bacterial virulence. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents on partial thickness wounds containing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. All wounds were inoculated with 106?CFU/ml and covered for 48 hrs under a polyurthene film to promote biofilm formation. Wounds were divided into three treatment groups; triple antibiotic ointment (Polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc, neomycin), mupirocin cream and untreated control. Wounds were treated twice daily. Wounds were cultured for bacterial quantitation at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120?hrs. Significant reduction in CFU/ml was observed only after several days of treatments. This finding supports the antimicrobial resistance that occurs when bacteria live within biofilms. Our previous studies demonstrated that both of these agents were able to completely eliminate planktonic S. aureus(106) at the early time points. This study demonstrates that when bacterial biofilms are established in wounds there is a longer response time for topical antimicrobial activity suggesting bacterial resistance.

AB  - The inflammatory events of atherosclerosis involve monocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and several cytokines, including chemokines. Atherosclerosis begins with recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel injury. In the vessel wall, these cells are activated to become macrophages that scavenge toxic material such as oxidized LDL and transition into ?foam cells? which will eventually lead to plaque formation. Tobacco smoke is known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. The chemokine MCP-1 is involved in recruiting monocytes to the injured blood vessel wall and is commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. Our data show that both ?first-hand? and ?second-hand? cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 production in cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (EC), suggesting that cigarette smoke may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating aortic EC to produce MCP-1 in blood vessels after smoke injury. To test whether MCP-1 links smoking and cardiovascular disease, we are studying the expression of this molecule in mice that are either transgenic for human ApoB or are null for MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, by exposing the mice to smoke in a way that closely resembles human smoking. Blood samples from the mice were tested for carboxyhemoglobin, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and MCP-1 at successive weeks after initiation of smoking and the aortas isolated to analyze for plaque size and MCP-1 expression in the tissue. The carboxyhemoglobin test shows that the mice are exposed to smoke. Plasma MCP-1 and HDL levels are reduced in the smoking groups, whereas LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol remain unchanged. On one hand, the decrease in circulating HDL levels suggests that the reason smokers develop atherosclerosis may be because the rate of cholesterol clearance is slowed down. On the other hand, a decrease in circulating MCP-1 level may reflect that this chemokine accumulates in blood vessel walls, conferring stronger ability for attraction of monocytes. This work is supported by TRDRP and Phillip Morris.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.
