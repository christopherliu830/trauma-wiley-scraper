AB  - Introduction: Low-energy laser photostimuation has been reported to affect the proliferative phase of wound healing and stimulate macrophages. Light-emitting diodes (LED) are an efficient, inexpensive source of low energy photons. We propose that LED therapy will stimulate macrophage production of VEGF and NO. Methods: Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells (5???105cells/ml) were treated with or without LPS (10?ng/ml) and IFN-gamma (100?Units/ml) for 24 hours. Cells were divided into groups: 1) control ? no LED, 2) 670?nm, 3) 730?nm, 4) 880?nm, and 5) combination (880?nm/730?nm/670?nm) at 4?J/cm2 per wavelength. Twenty-four hours post-LED, conditioned media was analyzed for VEGF (ELISA) and nitrites (Greiss assay). Proliferation was assessed using BrDU incorporation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test. Results: In serum-starved cells, proliferation was unchanged by LED. VEGF and nitrite levels were increased in groups 4 (VEGF?=?1057.1?+/??100.3?pg/ml; nitrites?=?11.13?+/? 0.79?uM) and 5 (VEGF?=?1148.9?+/??88.5?pg/ml; nitrites?=?10.72?+/??1.03?uM) compared to control (VEGF?=?812.2?+/??94.8?pg/ml; nitrites?=?7.32?+/??1.92?uM). LPS/IFN decreased proliferation 25 percent at all wavelengths compared to control?+?LPS/IFN (p?<?0.01). Nitrite and VEGF levels were markedly elevated in all five LPS/IFN-treated groups with no appreciable intergroup differences. Conclusions: LPS/IFN stimulation resulted in maximally elevated levels of nitrites and VEGF, possibly masking the effects of LED. Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells responded to LED treatment at 880?nm and combined wavelengths with increased VEGF and NO production. These results suggest that LED treatment at 880?nm and 880?nm/730?nm/670?nm may upregulate the production of pro-angiogenic factors by macrophages in the wound bed.

AB  - Transforming growth factor ?(TGF?) has both positive and negative effects on cutaneous wound healing. Smad7 acts as a major downstream antagonist of TGF? signaling in keratinocytes and its role in wound healing has not been defined. We have established a Smad7 transgenic mouse line using a keratin 5 (K5) promoter (K5.Smad7) which expresses Smad7 transgene at a mild level (?2 fold of the endogenous Smad7 in the skin). These mice did not have overt skin defects as shown from our previous Smad7 transgenic mice expressing much higher levels of the Smad7 transgene (EMBO J 2002, 21:2580?90). K5.Smad7 mice from the above low expressor line and non-transgenic littermates were subject to 6-mm full-thickness excisional wounding. K5.Smad7 mice exhibited early scab rejection, reduced inflammation, and accelerated re-epithelialization as compared to non-transgenic mice. To further determine the stage-specific effects of Smad7 on wound healing, we generated a transgenic model in which Smad7 transgene expression can be induced in the epidermis and hair follicles (gene-switch-Smad7) by topically RU486 application. Smad7 induction from day 3 to day 7 after excisional wounding reduced inflammatory responses through suppressing expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in gene-switch-Smad7 mice as compared to control mice. Meanwhile, overexpression of Smad7 exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, which correlated with increased expression of metalloproteinases and elevated Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling in the leading epidermal edges in gene-switch-Smad7 wounds compared to control wounds. Smad7 induction from day 7 to day 20 after excisional wounding reduced dermal fibrotic response and angiogenesis in the dermis, resulting in a better tissue repair. We conclude that the effectsof Smad7 on wound healing are likely due to blocking the negative effects of TGF? on cutaneous wound healing.

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem, resulting in both adverse tissue form and function and the goal of therapeutic interventions is to reduce and prevent excessive scarring. We have demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (rAd-p21), inhibited scar formation by blocking cell cycle progression and attenuated cell proliferation at the wound site (Perkins et?al 2002). Recently, we have shown rAd-p21 specific antiproliferative effects on granulation tissue in vivo(Gu, et?al, manuscript submitted). Safety parameters using rAd-p21 for anti-scarring may include effects on wound strength and dehiscence of the wound. We tested effects of rAd-p21 on wound strength in vivo using tensile strength as an endpoint and included comparisons with other clinically relevant antiproliferative agents. Specifically, rAd-p21 at doses from 1???107 to 3.8???1010 particle (PN) per incision was administered intradermally to linear rat incisions and assayed 14?28 days post treatment. rAd-p21 mildly reduced tensile strength at high doses (≥3???1010PN), whereas low to moderate doses (1???107 to 1???1010PN) had no effect. Interestingly, all rAd-p21 treated wounds regained tensile strength indistinguishable from vehicle control, 4 weeks after treatment, suggesting that rAd-p21 wounds recover with time. An adenovirus control vector, not containing a gene (rAd-Empty), showed subtle reduction of tensile strength that was only statistically significant at day 21. This suggests that delivery of rAd-Empty alone in the wound has little effect on wound strength. Triamcinolone at 5?mg/mL/wound, 5-FU at 10?mg/mL/wound, and low doses of MMC did not significantly reduce tensile strength, although high doses of MMC (0.2?mg/mL/wound) severely reduced tensile strength which failed to recover after 28 days. Morphological analysis of all groups revealed necrosis only in the MMC treatment. This data suggests that rAd-p21 may reduce the hyperproliferative status in excessive scar formation with minimal effects on wound strength.

AB  - Introduction: Angiogenesis is thought to be important for granulation tissue formation and for the delivery oxygen and other nutrients to the healing wound bed. We examined whether angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) such as endostatin decrease neovascularization in full-thickness wounds leading to impaired granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure. Methods: Endostatin at tumor-inhibiting doses (20?mg/kg/BID) was injected daily starting three days prior to surgery. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the mouse dorsum using a novel wound healing model developed in our lab. A second experimental group had topical VEGF (10??g/QD) applied to these wounds. Both groups were compared to PBS-treated controls. Wounds were analyzed for closure time, granulation tissue formation, and wound vascularity using CD31. Results: Endostatin-treatment delayed wound closure compared to control mice (17.4d?±?1.51 vs. 12.8?±?0.89, P?<?0.05), resulted in decreased granulation tissue formation at all time points (P?<?0.05), and significantly reduced wound vascularity as measured by CD31+ vessel counts (P?<?0.05). VEGF application to the wound bed of endostatin-treated mice normalized wound closure despite endostatin treatment (13.8d?±?1.1 vs. 17.44d?±?1.51, P?<?0.05). Conclusion: Endostatin impairs wound angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation and delays full-thickness wound closure. Topical VEGF was able to reverse this effect and may represent a novel approach to improve wound healing in patients receiving AI. These findings may have serious implications for patients undergoing AI treatment that require surgery or who have wound healing complications.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.

AB  - The importance of controlling the bioburden in wounds can not be over emphasized. Glycerine based gel sheets have been used extensively to show their bacteriostatic/fungistatic properties. Hoekstra studied animal wounds and compared glycerine dressings with water based dressings and the glycerine showed superior bioburden reduction. Vandeputte showed similar results when comparing hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings and looked at the histology of the wounds to find differences in the quantities of the types of cells present. The reduced scar formation of wounds are thought to be attributed to the influence of the glycerine on the healing process. Hoestra has reported the dramatic reduction in the inflammation reaction soon after application of the glycerine gel dressing. Studies by Oliveria-Gandia, Davis, and Mertz showed the glycerine dressings to be more effective than hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings in reducing bioburden in animal wounds that were inoculated with microbes and also reducing biocounts in appropriate growth medium. Vandeputte conducted a diabetic study(no exclusions) that compared the glycerine dressing (n?=?15) with standard protocol(n?=?14) for diabetic foot wounds, that showed the test dressing to be far superior. He along with thousands of other nurses around the world have reported the use of glycerine dressings on superficial burns to reduce pain, reduce the chance for infection, reduce scar formation, and to protect the wound from friction and pressure. J. Baksa extensively used the glycerine gel sheets in his burn unit not only for the superficial wounds but also for 3rd and 4th degree burns on children as well as after surgical removal of hypertrophic and keloid scars to prevent reoccurrence. T.M. Baum and M.J. Busuito also reported the use of the glycerine dressing for scar prevention and treatment. The glycerine dressing has been used extensively for te treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitals, nursing homes, athletic fields, as well as, under casts, splints and braces. R. Horchner reported a >95% reduction in pressure ulcers in a direct comparison to the control and to hydrocolloids.

AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in intestinal healing in intra-abdominal infection. Currently, the effect of localized intra-abdominal infection on anastomotic healing and strength is not known. This study was designed to evaluate anastomotic wound healing in the presence of intra-abdominal abscess. 30 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 270?300 grams were used for this experiment. 20 animals underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with 16 gauge needle. They were followed for 14 days. 9 of them died in the first week. The CLP animals had an initial 20% weight loss; however by day 10 they had a gradual return toward control weight. At the end of 14 days, rats from CLP group (n?=?11) and control group (n?=?10) underwent laparotomy and single-layer left colonic anastomosis. Blood cultures and abdominal swab cultures were sent from both groups. Post-operatively, animals were allowed to recover, food and water were offered ad libitum. At post-operative day five, animals were euthanized by thiopental overdose. Following anastomotic bursting pressure measurements, two samples were taken from the anastomotic line for subsequent determination of hydroxyproline content. Groups were compared with Students?t test. Data were expressed as means?±?SEM. In the post-operative period, all rats lost 10% to 12% of their body weight. No bacterial growth was detected in cultures. Hydroxyproline content measurements were significantly higher in the CLP group (11.2?±?0.3 vs. 9.8?±?0.5?ug HPO/mg dry tissue weight. P?<?0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in bursting pressure measurements between the groups (177?±?6.3 vs. 164?±?10.4?mmHg. P?>?0.05). These findings suggest that localized intra-abdominal infection without sepsis doesn?t inhibit intestinal anastomotic healing.

AB  - There is a wide spectrum of treatment modalities to manage hypertrophic scars, techniques like surgical excision, intralesional application of corticosteroids, pressure therapy or laser therapy are extensively used. From a cosmetic and physiological point of view scars are predominantly a concern of the patients, the cosmetic relevance for doctors is often of less importance. Therefore a treatment that can be performed by the patient her-/himself might be advantageous if it is efficacious and safe. Since the early 1980s so-called ?silicone gel sheeting? has been a widely used safe clinical management option for hypertrophic scars and keloids. The principle of the latter treatment has now been adapted and optimised towards a specific easily applicable adhesive polyurethane patch. This breathable, hypoallergenic patch is very well tolerated and avoids ? in contrast to silicone sheets ? moisture accumulation on the skin. Several clinical studies on both mature scars and on scar formation after surgical incisions show a reduction in visibility, redness, and roughness of the scars. The recommended eight weeks treatment might even be interrupted daily for twelve hours; the scar reducing effect is achieved as well. Extensive investigations on the polyurethane patch in vivo and in vitro propose an improved remodelling process of the scar tissue due to thermal and pressure effects of the patch but not by stratum corneum hydration. In vivo a better microcirculation can be observed in the scar tissue after treatment and in vitro an activation of enzymes involved in the remodelling process can be measured. In summary, physical effects are likely to be responsible for the successful results in clinical studies and individual applications of the new polyurethane patch for the reduction of hypertrophic scars.

AB  - Abstract Failure to downregulate inflammatory responses is often used to explain why chronic wounds fail to heal. The beneficial effects of surgical debridement are thought to be in part due to the transformation of a chronic wound to an acute wound, thereby allowing the inflammatory phase of acute wound healing to be reactivated. We tested the hypothesis that subcutaneous injection of the inducible isoform of the 70?kDa mammalian heat shock protein (iHSP70) will cause acute inflammatory swelling in an in vivo murine model. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Student?s t-test and significance was accepted when p?<?0.05. Subcutaneous injection of stress proteins iHSP70 was associated with significantly increased acute swelling in comparison to injections of saline, autologous serum (AS) or denatured iHSP70, *p?<?0.05, see figure below. Histological analysis demonstrated increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in those tissues receiving iHSP70. Stress proteins, within the acute wound environment, are proinflammatory and may set the stage for persistent inflammation within the chronic wound bed. Stress proteins may be future targets for therapeutic manipulation wherever acute inflammation fails to be downregulated. Exp.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate expression patterns of protein kinases and protein kinase activities in human corneal fibroblasts treated with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Methods: Human corneal fibroblast cultures were grown to confluence and treated with CTGF for 0, 5, and 15 minutes. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were obtained; protein kinase expression and activity arrays were performed using Kinetworks? analysis (screening for expression of 75 different protein kinases and 31 different phosphoproteins). Further studies using extended time courses of CTGF exposure in corneal fibroblasts (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes) were performed using immunoblot analysis to detect expression of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-cat), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). All results and were normalized by comparison to beta-actin. Results: After 5 minutes of exposure to CTGF, levels of active proteins increased for 21 of the 75 kinases analyzed. Some notable protein kinases that were induced include: death-associated kinase 1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2, protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-cat), protein kinase B alpha, and protein kinase C (ε, ?, and ?, subunits). Extended time course analysis of PKA-cat and FAK showed statistically significant increases in expression following CTGF stimulation within 15 minutes. Conclusion: CTGF increased the levels of active protein kinases in human corneal fibroblast cultures, including PKA-cat and FAK after 5 minutes of exposure. These results further our understanding of the signal transduction mechanism activated by CTGF in corneal fibroblasts. This suggests that CTGF mediates the effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) on protein kinase expression and phosphorylation of second messengers in processes such as cell proliferation and collagen synthesis.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the development of wound dressings that possess functionality beyond providing physical protection and optimal moisture environment. To this end, a novel dressing material based on a sulfonated-hydrocarbon backbone has been developed for the controlled release of therapeutic agents into chronic wounds. This versatile polymer possesses an ion-exchange capability that makes it amenable for binding and releasing a variety of potential agents. Polymer backbone was coated onto polyester fabric and then modified by ion exchange to incorporate Na+, Ag+, or doxycycline onto the polymer. The ability of several formulations of this hydrocarbon backbone product to sequester elastase and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) was then examined. Wound fluids containing elastase and MMP-8 were obtained from pooled wound fluids obtained from consented patients with pressure ulcers. Equivalent weights of product formulations were incubated for 2?4 hours at 25?°C with the wound fluids and then the remaining activities of elastase and MMP-8 determined using specific substrates (methoxysuucinyl-ala-ala-pro-val-p-nitroanilide and collagen type I respectively). Untreated polyester fabric served as a control and weight equivalents of gauze and Promogran? were also included for the purposes of comparison. The average reduction in apparent elastase activity in the wound fluid was 4%, 20.4%, 14%, 29%, and 55% for gauze, Promogran?, doxycycline, Ag+, and Na+ formulations respectively. Only Promogran? and the doxycycline formulation affected a decrease in apparent collagenolytic activity. These preliminary results provide evidence in support of the versatility of these new biomaterials for the controlled modulation of the chronic wound environment.

AB  - Background: Physiological differences between dominant and non-dominant arms may play an important role in wound healing of the upper extremities. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) studied this phenomenon in a human forearm model of acute wound healing. Methods: With informed consent, sixteen normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies on the flexor surface of both forearms: 2 biopsies on the dominant arm, and 2 on the non-dominant arm. The acute wound sites were then treated with i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel topically at various dosing intervals (Q.D. versus Q.O.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB alone Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone, or iii) bacitracin alone. Time-to-complete healing was measured as the primary endpoint. Results: The average time-to-complete healing for the dominant arm was shorter than the time required to heal the biopsies on the non-dominant arm, irregardless of the treatment applied. Conclusion: In the forearm biopsy model of acute wound healing, arm dominance is an independent variable and must considered in study designs. We postulate that this effect may be due to variation in microvascular perfusion. These results provoke further investigation into the physiological mechanisms underlying increased rate of healing in the dominant extremity.

AB  - Maththaan thailam, the Datura leaf juice is traditionally used for healing of wounds and related ailments in India. However, the scientific validity of the thailam has not been explored in the literatures. In the present study, the efficacy of maththaan thailam on healing of three types of wounds namely Open, Burn and Diabetic wound in animal models has been studied. Healing pattern and biochemical characterization of granulation tissue were assessed over the healing periods. Studies were more concentrated on to evaluate the change in the matrix metallo proteinase profile in the three different types of wound with respect to the applied thailam. Further supports were also expected from the antioxidant levels and histopathological examination of granulation tissue. It has been observed that among the three types of wounds, delayed healing was observed with diabetic wound. Complete healing of 2???2?cm2 wound size was achieved only after 22 days, whereas burn and open wound took only 16 and 9 days for complete closure. Further, MMP?s profile also showed a variation in the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 with respect to healing property. Biochemical and histochemical results and the antioxidant levels are highly correlated with the healing property irrespective of the wounds
