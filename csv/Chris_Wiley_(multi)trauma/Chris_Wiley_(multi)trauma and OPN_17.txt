AB  - Elderly hospital patients have ample exposure to situations and procedures that may increase their pressure ulcer risk. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in elderly medical patients and to determine whether the risk of pressure ulcers is associated with longer emergency department (ED) stays, lengthy procedures in the ED, or use of immobilizing restraints, medications, or devices in the ED. The study cohort was made up of 3,233 patients aged 65 or over admitted through the EDs of two Philadelphia hospitals. Sixty-five percent of subjects were aged 80 or more, 61% were female, and 69% were Black. The incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers on Day 3 of the hospital stay, as ascertained by direct skin examination, was 6.2%. There were 266 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers among 201 patients (mean per patient 1.3 pressure ulcers) 27% of the pressure ulcers were stage 1, 54% were stage 2, and the remainder were stages 3 or 4 or could not be staged. The median length of stay in the ED was 6.6 hours. The association between hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and extrinsic risk factors will be presented. The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors may lead to the development of effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.

AB  - Introduction: Thermal injury to the female breast is one of the most challenging aspects of aesthetic burn surgery today. As the ability to provide coverage for large body surface injuries has progressed greatly in recent years; attention can now be directed towards achieving aesthetically pleasing results. Breast reconstruction in the burn patient can be accomplished in several ways. In planning the reconstruction, one must account for gender, age, and stage of breast development at the time of injury. The following is the treatment protocol utilized at our institution. After determining the level of injury the injured area is cleansed and treated with topical anti-microbial agents such as Silvadene. If the decision is made to excise and graft the injured area one of two algorithms is followed. The first choice involves excising the burn and placing a split thickness skin graft to the area involved. This is done by placing a sheet graft and using aerosolized fibrin sealant to affix it to the wound bed. If the burn involves deeper elements of tissue then a second approach is taken which includes excision of the burn down to the level of fascia with preservation of the breast mounds and the nipple areola complex (NAR). The (NAR) is spared excision and allowed to heal. Reconstruction of the (NAR) can be deferred for a secondary procedure depending upon the response to primary healing. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to the area of injury. Again a sheet graft is preferred and fibrin sealant is utilized to improve graft fixation and contour. We attribute our excellent results to the sheet grafts and fibrin sealant used. It should be noted that the increased vascularity of the breast fat when compared to fat located elsewhere in the body allows the grafts to adhere and survive on this generally difficult to graft surface. Methods: We identified five female patients at our institution over the last 18 months with thermal injuries to the breasts. Each patient was placed into one of the two treatment algorithms. Results: The five patients had excellent outcomes. Breast mounds and symmetry were preserved. Further development of the breast was allowed in each patient. One patient even underwent a breast augmentation after surviving a 50% TBSA injury. Proper use of fibrin sealant and sheet grafts account for the excellent results seen at this institution. Conclusion: Following careful evaluation of the burned female breast cosmetically and functionally acceptable results can be attained when following our institution?s protocol for breast reconstruction in the female burn victim.

AB  - Aim: To document successful healing of a recalcitrant venous ulcer with adjunctive use of Dermagraft Materials and Methods: A 74-year-old Hispanic male presented with a chronic venous ulcer at the medial aspect of his right ankle. Biopsy failed to reveal malignancy and confirmed stasis changes. Treatment was ongoing including compression therapy, local debridements, and moist wound healing, off-loading, and nutritional support. The wound remained free of infection. Due to the continued recalcitrant nature of the lesion multiple applications of Dermagraft were utilized to augment healing. Results: The researcher observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue. Conclusions: Dermagraft appears to augment healing in patients with venous ulcers and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgements: Smith & Nephew Wound Management, Largo, Fl.

AB  - The use of adjunctive peri-wound, ultrasound with either a 1?MgHz or 3?MgHz frequency has been reported on in the literature with variable results. MIST ultrasound therapy is a novel application of direct wound bed application of kilohertz ultrasound waves utilizing a normal saline mist as the coupling mechanism, allowing for no direct patient contact. The mist generated by the system is of relative uniform particle size and acts as a conduit of ultrasound energy. Unlike ultrasonic baths, which dissipate the vibrational energy over a large area, the transducer horn focuses the energy into a smaller area of application. The MIST? system consists of an ultrasonic power supply (generator), a transducer (or alternately referred to as the converter), and an applicator coupled to the transducer. The generator converts voltage to high frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is transmitted to the piezoelectric transducer within the converter, where it is changed to mechanical vibrations. The generator is designed to operate the converter at 40?kHz with a distal displacement of 60 microns. Published reports have described various biological effects of low frequency ultrasound including VEGF and PDGF production, increased protein synthesis, improved bone and wound healing. Other authors have published abstracts demonstrating clinical efficacy of this device on a broad range of patients with recalcitrant wounds. This report describes the clinical results of a prospective, non-randomized, efficacy trial, adding MIST ultrasound therapy to current treatment protocols in recalcitrant wounds. Wound healing trajectories before and after treatment will be evaluated and wound healing will be assessed with laser Doppler image analysis and trans-cutaneous oximetry.

AB  - Background: More than three quarters of patients with a connective tissue disorder will develop secondary Raynauld?s disease. This more severe form of the Raynauld?s can lead to digital ischemia, tissue loss and may even result in the need for amputation of one or more digits. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor currently approved for use in vascular disease of the lower extremities. Case History: In August of 2002 a 62 year old female pianist with scleroderma presented to the wound clinic with a two year history of intractable digital pain secondary to ischemic ulcerations of the index, long and ring fingers of the right hand. She suffered from secondary Raynauld?s disease. Prior unsuccessful treatments included warming the hands, calcium channel blockade, anticoagulation, topical xylocaine and narcotic analgesics. In August of 2002 cilostazol was started at 100mg BID. Wound care consisted of serial debridement, moist wound healing and topical rhPDGF. Results: Four weeks into treatment the patient?s narcotic requirement decreased substantially and the fingers had a pink appearance. The ring finger healed after eight weeks. At three months the patient discontinued narcotic pain medication. Nine months into treatment the index finger had healed and she resumed playing the piano. The long finger finally healed one year after she initially presented to the wound clinic. Conclusion: Cilostazol may be an important adjunct in the treatment of secondary Raynauld?s disease particularly when digital ischemia has developed.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on soft tissue are not well characterized. This study utilized a diabetic wound model to examine the effects of PEMF effects on soft tissue healing. Methods: Wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db and wild type C57BL6 mice. Mice were exposed to PEMF (4.5?ms pulse/15?hz) for 8?hrs/day for 14 days. Gross closure was assessed with digital analysis of area changes over time. Histological examination assessed granulation and epithelial gap, cell proliferation (BrdU), and endothelial cell density (CD31). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence or absence of PEMF for 8?hrs and VEGF/FGF2 was measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Results: Mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, db/db: 60%(PEMF) vs. 78%(control), C57BL6: 15% vs. 42%, p?<?0.05) and day 14 (db/db: 21% vs. 55%, C57BL6: 8% vs. 28%, p?<?0.05), with increased granulation and cell proliferation (db/db day 7: 52?±?8 vs. 31?±?5 cells/HPF (200x)). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly higher CD31 density in wounds exposed to PEMF at day 7 (vessels/HPF, db/db: 28?±?4 vs. 17?±?4, C57BL6: 41?±?7 vs. 28?±?6) and day 14 (db/db: 32?±?6 vs. 21?±?5, C57BL6: 48?±?5 vs. 40?±?5). HUVECs in PEMF exhibited 5-fold higher levels of FGF2 compared to controls after 30?min (20.50?pg/ml?±?6.75 vs. 4.25?pg/ml?±?0.75), with no change in VEGF through 8?hrs. Conclusions: PEMF accelerates closure time and endothelial cell proliferation in wound healing. Upregulation of FGF2 in HUVECs exposed to PEMF suggests that release of angiogenic growth factors may explain increased vascular density and accelerated wound closure. Clinical uses include treatment for diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. This work is supported in part by the Alumni Fund, Alumni Association of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (MJC).

AB  - A critical limitation of using retroviral vectors for gene therapy is their inability to infect non-dividing cells. Although, the adenoviral vectors have the advantage of being able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, they elicit inflammatory response, thus making the interpretation of in vivo experiments harder. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral vectors do not have those limitations, however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. To determine if low-oxygen microenvironment affects viral vector-mediated gene transfection, we have used two other viral vectors, Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral constructs in vitro and in vivo to express foreign genes in hypoxic cultured human dermal fibroblasts and ischemic rat wounds. Both cultured normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) human dermal fibroblasts were identically transfected by the AAV vector. A lenti6-LacZ construct was injected onto the periphery of rat ischemic and non-ischemic wound (106 pfu/wound) at the time of wounding. Wounds were harvested at post-operative day 7. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with a in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed without any inflammatory response. No significant difference of transfection efficiency was observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic wounds. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and Lentiviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in both ischemic and non-ischemic cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Epithelialization and vascularization are key elements involved in the repair of cutaneous wounds. One method of regulation for these pathways is expression of a signaling molecule known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which, in turn, is regulated by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). It has been suggested that chronic wounds, which are most commonly located in ischemic tissue among the elderly, may be the result of a loss of function in the VEGF regulation pathway. Using our rat back flap model, which demonstrates the negative influences of age and ischemia on wound healing, we examined the relative expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in aged and young rats at 3,7, and 10 days post-wounding. Four full-thickness biopsy punches (7?mm) were made on the back of each aged and young rat. The rostral wound pair was made ischemic by raising a transverse flap (1.8?cm wide???8?cm length). The caudal wound pair served as a non-ischemic control. Inserting a sterilized polyethylene sheet under both ischemic and nonischemic wounds prevented wound contraction. RNA was extracted from the tissue at the specified time points, and run on Real-Time PCR to determine relative expression of VEGF and HIF-1. Preliminary data suggest that, at the 3 day time point, there is a significant increase in both HIF-1 and VEGF expression in young rats under ischemic conditions and a significant increase in VEGF expression in aged rats under ischemia with a strong (but not significant) trend towards increase in HIF-1 as well. While the rat model does not produce significant differences between aged and young animals, this upregulation under ischemia indicates that HIF-1 and VEGF expression may play a vital role in the early signaling of ischemic wound repair.

AB  - Introduction: Fetal mouse skin wounds heal without scar before gestational day E17. Because scarless repair is inherent to fetal skin and occurs superimposed on skin differentiation, genome-wide gene expression during skin development was tested. Methods: Dorsal skin from BALB/C mice fetuses at E14, E15, E18 and E20 was collected. RNAs from individual fetuses were hybridized to mouse microarrays with 42,000 gene elements. The E14/E18 hybridizations were repeated three times, and the E15/E20 repeated twice with different samples. (?x??=?fold change). Results: Increased genes on E18 and E20 were clustered into several groups: 1) ECMs: type I (2.8x), III (2.3x), VI, and XIV procollagens; 2) Cell surface: integrin beta1 binding protein2 (5.2x), integral membrane protein2A and 2B (avg 3.8x); 3) Proteases: mast cell protease4 (15x) and 5 (24x), MMP23 (3x); 4) Growth factor-related: acidic FGF (3.7x), FGF receptor3 (2.9x), TGF-alpha (2.3x). Decreased genes on E18 and E20 included: 1) Growth factors: TGF-beta2 (0.42x), PDGF-alpha (0.41x), PDGF receptor-beta (0.37x), NGF receptor associated protein (0.18x); 2) Proteases: MMP 11 (0.27x), 14 (0.39x); 3) ECM: fibromodulin (0.5x), Vcam1 (0.22x), keratin18 (0.2x) and 19 (0.46x), collagen XVIII (0.36x). Conclusions: Genes with increased expression at E14, E15 and decreased expression at E18, E20 have possible antifibrotic function. These data identify hundreds of possible anti-fibrotic and pro-fibrotic genes as candidates for further functional analysis as regulators of repair. Supported by NIH DE00463?03

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, there have been a number of studies in Europe on contact sensitivity in patients with chronic leg ulcerations with a frequency of positive patch test results ranging from 40 to 82.5%. The prevalence of sensitization has not been studied in North America. Furthermore, many of the newer dressings and wound care products in the market have not been studied for contact sensitivity in patients with chronic wounds. Objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitivity in patients with history of leg ulcers in two North American study centers, 2) to compare our results to the European studies and to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) database and 3) to help delineate a standard battery of allergens for patch testing in North American leg ulcer patients Methods: 54 patients with an active or past leg ulcer were prospectively entered in the study. The patients were patch tested to both the NACDG Standard series, as well as, a comprehensive supplemental series of 48 allergens including wound care medicaments and dressings. Results: 63% of patients were sensitized to at last one allergen. The most common allergens were Balsam of Peru (29.6%), bacitracin (24.1%), fragrance mix (20.4%), wood tar mix (20.4%), propylene glycol (13.5%), neomycin sulfate (13%), benzalkonium chloride (13%), carba mix (11.1%), nickel sulfate (11.1%) and Duoderm CGF (11.1%). Duoderm CGF was the most allergenic dressing in our study group. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of positive patch tests in patients with past or current leg ulcerations. Using a modified leg ulcer series along with the standard NACDG series is very important in evaluating patients with leg ulcers.
