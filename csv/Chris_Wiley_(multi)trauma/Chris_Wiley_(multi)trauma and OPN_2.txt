AB  - Modern medical practices allow patients to survive acute insults and be sustained by machinery and medicines for extended periods of time. We define chronic critical illness as a later stage of prolonged critical illness that requires tracheotomy. These patients have persistent elevations of inflammatory cytokines, diminished hypothalamic?pituitary function, hypercatabolism, immobilization, and malnutrition. The measurement of bone turnover markers reveals markedly enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption that is uncoupled from osteoblastic bone formation. We review the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the metabolic bone disease of chronic critical illness and suggest potential therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract Over the past decade, management of the T1 renal mass has focused on nephron-sparing surgery. Robotic partial nephrectomy has played an increasing role in the technique of preserving renal function by decreasing warm ischemia time, as well as optimizing outcomes of hemorrhage and fistula. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy is designed to provide a minimally-invasive nephron-sparing surgical option utilizing reconstructive capability, decreasing intracorporeal suturing time, technical feasibility and safety. Ultimately, its benefits are resulting in its dissemination across institutions. Articulated instrumentation and three-dimensional vision facilitate resection, collecting system reconstruction and renorrhaphy, leading to decreased warm ischemia time while preserving oncological outcomes. The aim of the present review was to present our surgical sequence and technique, as well as review the current status of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the impact of increased experience in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) on perioperative and oncological outcomes To detail the complications encountered in establishing a RAPN programme at a tertiary referral centre and the factors associated with these complications Patients and Methods The initial consecutive 233 patients undergoing RAPN between March 2008 and May 2012 at our institution were identified. Patients were divided into quartiles to evaluate outcomes, and uni- and multivariate predictors of complications were calculated Results In progressive quartiles, patients tended to have more complex renal tumours as evaluated by R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry (P?<?0.01) or preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical classification (PADUA) scores (P?=?0.003), and percentage endophytic (P?=?0.01). Developing technique increased the patients undergoing unclamped PN (P?<?0.01). The mean time in the operating room (from skin incision to closure) decreased significantly from 225 to 183?min (P?<?0.01) and warm ischaemia time decreased from 28 to 15?min, when clamping (P?<?0.01). Clavien graded complication rate (P?=?0.26) and positive margin rate (P?=?0.32) was unchanged by quartile. Conclusion We show that increasing experience allows more complex tumours to be removed with similar outcomes in patients undergoing RAPN. The complication rates and perioperative outcomes were similar in four successive quartiles of an initial experience of RAPN.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report our surgical technique of robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RLPN) for renal tumours of <7?cm and present their clinical outcomes, as minimally invasive PN is an increasingly viable option for small renal tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 2005 to December 2006, 20 consecutive patients (mean age 58.2?years, sd 7.9) had RLPN and a follow-up of ≥1?year, all surgery being undertaken by one surgeon. All cases were elective except in one patient with a solitary kidney. We used the three-arm da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in a four-port, transperitoneal approach. Transient vascular occlusion was applied in all cases using a tourniquet technique. The tumour was excised with a 5-mm margin using cold-cut scissors, and the margins were assessed by frozen sections. The specimen was placed in an impervious bag for subsequent removal via the camera port. Under direct vision, we repaired all pelvicalyceal system entries with absorbable sutures. After the entire tumour bed surface was lined with FlosealTM (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, ISA) the capsule/parenchyma was closed with running suture, reinforced by haemostatic clips. RESULTS The mean (sd) operative and warm ischaemia times were 82.7?(17.0) and 21.7?(2.4)?min, respectively, and the mean estimated blood loss was 189?(32)?mL. There were no intraoperative complications or conversion to open surgery. There was also no bleeding after surgery, perinephric haematoma or urinary leakage. The mean (sd) tumour size was 30.2?(2.4)?mm, while margins were negative in all cases of malignancy. At the 1-year follow-up there was no local recurrence, renal functional deterioration or late surgical complications. CONCLUSIONS Our RLPN technique is a safe and feasible option for small renal tumours. Reproducible technique and good team co-ordination are pivotal for obtaining good oncological and surgical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Platelet rich plasma (PRP), which includes many growth factors, can activate osteoid production, collagen synthesis and cell proliferation. Nanohydroxyapatite-type I collagen beads (CIB), which mimetic natural bone components, are not only flexible fillers for bone defect but also encourage osteogenesis. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are often used as an abundant cell source for tissue engineering. We used a rabbit model to combine PRP, CIB and BMSCs (CIB+PRP+BMSC) into a bone-like substitute to study its impact on bone regeneration, when compared to defect alone, PRP, CIB+PRP, and PRP+BMSC. CIB+PRP upregulated more alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in BMSCs than PRP alone at 4 weeks postoperation. CIB+PRP+BMSC and PRP+BMSC did not differ significantly in DNA content, total collagen content, and ALP activity at 8 weeks. In histological assay, both CIB+PRP+BMSC and PRP+BMSC showed more bone regeneration at 4 and 8 weeks. Higher trabecular bone volume in tissue volume (BV/TV) (31.15±2.67% and 36.93±1.01%), fractal dimension (FD) (2.30±0.18 and 2.65±0.02) and lower trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (2.30±0.18 and 1.35±0.16) of CIB+PRP+BMSC than of other groups at 4 and 8 weeks, and approach to of bone tissue (BV/TV=24.35±2.13%; FD=2.65±0.06; Tb.Sp=4.19±0.95). CIB+PRP+BMSC significantly enhanced new bone formation at 4 week. Therefore, nanohydroxyapatite-type I collagen beads combined with PRP and BMSCs produced a bone substitute with efficiently improved bone regeneration that shows promise to repair bone defects.
