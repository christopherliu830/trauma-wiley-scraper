AB  - Part I was an overview of the role and function of proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the pulpo?dentin complex; part II will focus on enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors. This review will discuss current knowledge regarding matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, serum proteins, and growth factors in dentin and the related dentin?pulp complex in an attempt to better understand their nature, role, and function in the dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Dentin formation in physiological and pathological conditions has been widely studied. However, the regulation and involvement of non-collageneous enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors are still not completely elucidated. MMPs, a family of 23 endopeptidases in humans, are collectively capable of degrading virtually all ECM components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases) participate in organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover, and pathological tissue destruction. Similarly, the lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) are capable of degrading ECM proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. These enzymes are implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue re-modeling states. Dentin also contains serum-derived proteins (such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and transferrin), and a variety of growth factors in the mineralized ECM are available for release during demineralization or other injury. A detailed description of the components of the above-mentioned dentin non-collageneous proteins will be summarized in this literature review.

AB  - Summary Human embryonic stem cells provide an ideal cell source for production of osteogenic cells due to their potential for expansion into therapeutically relevant numbers and the ability to differentiate into functional osteoblasts. The high demand for bone tissue repair necessitates the development of strategies to make functional bone. This chapter focuses on fundamental concepts in osteogenic differentiation and key protocols and techniques for inducing the differentiation of human ES cells into functional osteoblasts. Methods to determine osteogenic differentiation using osteocalcin or alkaline phosphatase immunocytochemistry are considered with emphasis on functional criteria such as production of mineralized bone nodules. The use von Kossa stain is discussed along with characterization of the mineralized matrix and ultrastructural studies with electron microscopy and FTIR. These techniques allow for proper characterization of osteogenic differentiation of human ES cells and permit this in vitro system to be used for studying mechanisms underpinning bone formation.

AB  - Rationale Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pancreatic disease with poor prognosis and pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal types of cancer that is symptomless in the early stage. Because the clinical and image findings of CP can overlap that of pancreatic cancer (PC) which leads to confusion in the diagnosis and treatment of PC, discovery/verification/validation of more accurate protein biomarkers to diagnose CP and PC is in urgent need. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords: ?biomarker?, ?marker?, ?chronic pancreatitis?, ?pancreatic cancer? or ?proteomics? for highly related researches. We focused on the articles published after the year 2005 in this review. Results We introduce the background to CP and PC and summarize the diagnosis of CP and PC, analytically validated protein biomarkers, and proteomic approaches for discovery/verification/validation. The potential use of mass spectrometry (MS) in clinical diagnosis is also discussed. Conclusions Continuously improving sensitivity of MS can provide deeper proteome for new marker discovery and high reliability for protein marker verification, validation, and clinical diagnosis. The analytically validated protein markers could be considered as targeted protein biomarkers for developing a MS platform in the clinical validation process or clinical diagnosis of CP and PC.

AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.

AB  - Abstract Among various classes of biomaterials, the majority of non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials exhibit piezoelectric properties, i.e., the accumulation of charge in response to applied mechanical stress or deformation. Due to the growing interest in nanomaterials, piezoelectric nano-biomaterials have been widely investigated, leading to remarkable advancements throughout the last two decades. Piezoelectric properties, high surface energy, targeting properties, and intricate cell?material interactions render piezoelectric nanomaterials highly attractive for application in therapeutics as well as regenerative medicine. Herein, the major focus is to highlight the wide range of applications of piezoelectric nano-biomaterials in drug delivery, theranostics, and tissue regeneration. After a brief introduction to piezoelectricity, an overview is provided on the major classes of piezoelectric biomaterials as well as a description of the origin of biopiezoelectricity in different tissues and macromolecules. Subsequently, relevant properties and postfabrication strategies of nanostructured piezoelectric biomaterials are discussed aiming to maximize piezoresponse. Finally, recent studies on nano- piezoceramics and piezopolymers are presented, with specific focus on barium titanate, zinc oxide, and polyvinylidene fluoride.
