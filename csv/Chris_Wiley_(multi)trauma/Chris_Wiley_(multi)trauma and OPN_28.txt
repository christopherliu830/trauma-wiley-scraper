AB  - Background:? Previously, we showed in a human forearm biopsy model of wound healing that acute healing dynamics can be characterized at the clinical and genetic level. Growth factor application by recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) accelerates the velocity of wound healing and modulates gene expression in wounds. To profile the function, structure, and genomics of acute healing, the human results were compared with a murine model of acute circular and incisional wounds. Methods:? Full thickness 8?mm circular skin wounds and linear surgical incisional wounds were created in 6-week-old Balb-C mice and recombinant angiogenic growth factors (PDGF vs. PDGF/FGF2/VEGF) were administered topically to wounds daily. Velocity of healing and time to complete closure were determined by digital planimetry. Tissue was examined for histopathological, morphometric, functional, and gene expression parameters, and compared to human results. Results:? Acute healing velocity can be quantified and compared in human and murine models. Linear incisions heal in distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and gene expression patterns compared to circular wounds. The cellular profile shows differences between wound types. Topical PDGF accelerates angiogenesis and time to complete acute healing. Human and murine gene expression was correlated. Results will be presented. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan component of normal dermis and a major component of the matrix synthesized during wound healing. Previous studies have shown that uncrosslinked HA is rapidly degraded and cleared in vivo, limiting its clinical utility. We have used a novel HA hydrogel scaffold that is crosslinked for prolonged bioavailability. It has a porous interior and a smooth surface. This scaffold can also be fabricated with collagen and linked to proteins or DNA to direct cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that this novel HA formulation might itself improve wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Purpose:? The present study explored the effects of a crosslinked HA hydrogel on wound healing. Methods:? Using an established model of wound healing, four 7?mm punch wounds were made on each ear of New Zealand rabbits. Each wound was immediately treated with topical application of one of the following: HA hydrogel (n?=?26), HA/collagen hydrogel (n?=?27), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(n?=?16). Wounds were harvested on day 8 for histologic evaluation. Sections were examined for epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth into wounds. Results:? HA- and HA/collagen-treated wounds showed statistically significant increases in epithelial (p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.007, respectively) and granulation tissue ingrowth (p?=?0.004 and p?=?0.01, respectively) when compared to PBS-treated controls. Conclusions:? In the rabbit ear ulcer model, the application of crosslinked HA and HA/collagen hydrogels accelerated wound healing as measured by epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth.

AB  - Background:? Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a novel method for producing a strong tissue-tissue seal using photosensitization. PTB cross-links tissues without causing thermal damage, although the mechanism of action in skin is not completely understood. Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered skin construct, is currently applied to chronic wounds and fixed in place by bolster, suture, staple, or glue. We postulated that PTB may have application for attaching Apligraf to skin. Materials and Methods:? An ex vivo model was used to characterize bonding of Apligraf and skin by PTB. Argon laser (514?nm) or IPL irradiation in the presence of the photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal was used to bond Apligraf and human cadaveric or porcine skin. Various outcome measurements were made to evaluate the efficacy and histological characteristics of the bonding. Conclusions:? Photochemical tissue bonding of Apligraf to human skin can be performed and further characterization is under way. Potential applications of PTB and Apligraf include the treatment of acute wounds, split thickness skin graft donor sites, burns, and debrided chronic wounds.

AB  - The understanding of bioengineered tissue has evolved over the past 5 years. Now considered ?cell therapy,? bioengineered tissue can provide a nonhealing wound with the appropriate complement of cytokines, growth factors, and healthy cells to promote the patient?s healing process. As clinicians have gained experience with Apligraf*, the process of wound bed preparation has proven to be a critical step in order to achieve optimal outcomes with the tissue construct. Recently, the investigators have evaluated a novel device, MIST? ultrasound , recently FDA cleared for the cleansing and debriding of wounds. A subgroup from a total of 23 patients in a research trial using MIST therapy for nonhealing wounds received an Apligraf as part of their treatment regimen. The'bioengineered tissue remained intact for a full 4 weeks postapplication and the appearance of the graft was quite different than our prior experience with the product. On removal of the wound/graft eschar, patients had achieved complete epithelialization. This report describes the patients who underwent this combination of technologies along with wound photographs, measurements and patient histories. As we learn more about the biochemistry of healing we are able to ?look? at how we combine and use advanced wound care technologies. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Wound healing is a multistep process that concludes with scar formation. A common clinical observation is that oral wounds exhibit privileged healing compared to extra-oral wounds. Current data demonstrates reduced inflammation and more rapid reepithelialization of oral wounds suggesting that reduced inflammation is vital to privileged repair. To examine the initiation of inflammation, the present study examines IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα production by oral versus cutaneous keratinocytes and compares mast cell infiltration in oral versus cutaneous wounds. Two 1?mm diameter excisional wounds were placed on the lateral tongue or dorsal skin of anesthetized BALB/c mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, wound tissue was harvested for analysis. Cytokine expression levels were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin. At every time point, levels of IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα mRNA were less in oral than dermal wounds. When analyzed by ELISA, IL-1 protein levels peaked at 6 hours in both oral and cutaneous wounds, yet the levels were lower in oral wounds. Mast cell infiltration was measured by counting toluidine blue positive cells in fixed wound sections. The number of mast cells/mm2 was decreased overall in oral mucosal wounds. These findings suggest that a decreased early inflammatory response to injury may be responsible for the privileged repair of oral mucosa.

AB  - Advocate Christ hospital is a 650-bed, level-one tertiary-care center that created a comprehensive wound care program in November 1998. Over the first 3 years of the program there were over 140 admissions per year directly from the wound center along with numerous hospital to hospital transfers for complex wound management. Prevalence rates therefore increased linearly over this time frame. The wound team calculated a system-wide (eight hospitals) spend of $2.1 million per year for specialty rental beds. Incidence rates for the system were at, but not lower than, national levels despite the high cost incurred. A $1.3 million capital purchase for KCI atmos-air 9000? mattresses resulted in the complete replacement of all medical surgical beds in all eight hospitals. An internal prevalence and incidence team was created and data were collected both at the hospital and system-wide level on a quarterly basis. Hospital and system incidence rates fell to or below 7%(targeted goal) and the entire project will achieve a return on investment in 18 months. Data to be presented include prevalence and incidence results, rental bed costs pre- and postbed purchase, and a detailed review of the process of creating an electronic prevalence and incidence tracking system.

AB  - Previous wound healing studies have attempted to improve angiogenesis (new blood vessel ingrowth). Recent studies suggest, however, that revascularization of wounds may also be accomplished by vasculogenesis: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow and blood that home to sites of tissue damage and form new blood vessels. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic and topical transplantation of EPCs for wound healing in an in vivo rabbit model. It was hypothesized that applying cells topically through an EPC-seeded albumin scaffold may promote revascularization from inside the wound versus only from the periphery. Further, it was hypothesized that combining topical and systemic transplantation of EPCs may increase vessel formation from both directions. Full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of New Zealand White rabbits. Wounds were treated with either an EPC-seeded scaffold, nonseeded scaffold, or no treatment (control). Additionally, half of the animals were given systemic injections of EPCs. Digital pictures were taken weekly until sacrifice to determine healing rates. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging scans were used to measure changes in blood perfusion during healing. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 4 weeks; wounds were excised and prepared for histological examination. Histomorphometry was used to calculate epithelialization and contraction rates, as well as the volume fraction of cell nuclei and blood vessels. Preliminary results suggest that animals that received systemic transplantations of EPCs had higher overall healing rates than those with no injection. Systemic transplantation alone improved healing over the control by the end of 2 weeks. When combined with a topical scaffold (both EPC-seeded and nonseeded), systemically injected cells showed improved healing by the end of the first week. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Electroporation of cells leads to breakdown of the ion gradients and release of intracellular contents. This triggers edema, which raises the local hydration level over its physiological value. Therefore, the state of water in an injured tissue is changed and the compartmentalization and dynamics of the spin populations during magnetic relaxation differ from healthy tissue. Methods:? We measured spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin density (M0) parameters of water protons in electroporated rat muscles by using a 4.7-Tesla GE/Bruker Omega scanner. The rats were sacrificed 3?h postshock and extensor digitorum longus, soleus and biceps femoris muscles were collected. Contralateral muscle samples served as controls. T2 and M0 were obtained using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill methods. Following MR imaging the water content in the tissue samples was measured. To infer T2 from the value corresponding to bulk water we also measured T2 of lysozyme and ribonuclease(1?mM) solutions (10?mM phosphate buffer at pH?=?7.0) as a function of protein concentration. Results:? T2 values were determined by fitting the signal amplitude from the echoes to the decay time. We obtained for deionized distilled water T2?=?614?±?31?ms, for lysozyme, T2?=?478?±?25?ms and for ribonuclease A, T2?=?423?±?22?ms. The analysis of T2-weighted MR images in rat muscles showed a 25?75% increase of the water T2 relaxation time in the three different muscle samples, of which soleus muscle showed the largest increase of 75%, from ?40?ms in controls to ?70?ms in injured muscles. Conclusions:? Electroporation leads to increased in T2, which may have two components. First, the accumulated water adds extra hydration layers to proteins. Second, the dynamics of water molecules may be altered as a result of development of the structural damage due to activation of degradative processes in the tissue.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.
