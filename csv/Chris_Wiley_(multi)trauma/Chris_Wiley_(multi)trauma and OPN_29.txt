AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Introduction:? Chronic, nonhealing wounds are often observed in tissues with poor oxygen supply. Impaired reepithelialization is a hallmark of these wounds; however, the pathogenesis of the retarded reepithelialization in chronic, ischemic wounds remains poorly understood. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) is involved in both normal and hypoxic wound healing response and exogenous overexpression of Smad3, a TGF-beta signaling intermediate, has been known to accelerate reepithelialization. In a recent study, Ad-Smad3 injection in the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model showed enhanced reepithelialization and granulation tissue area suggesting a positive effect of Smad3 on wound healing. However, little is known about the role of Smad3 in the ischemic wound healing process. In this study we examined the effect of Smad3 in an ischemic wound model. Methods:? Ad-Smad3 or LacZ (108?pfu/wound) empty vector was injected in either ear of White New Zealand Rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, these ears were rendered ischemic using an established model and four 7-mm full-thickness punch wounds were made on each ear. Results:? Histological evaluation showed a highly significant increase in reepithelialization, epithelial ingrowth and percentage of epithelialization in Ad-Smad3 transfected wounds versus ischemic wounds transfected with LacZ-empty vector (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Our data confirm the enhancing effect of Smad3 on reepithelialization in an ischemic wound model. The deficiency in reepithelialization, as evident in chronic ischemic wounds, could thus be ameliorated by excess Smad3. Therapeutic interventions using overexpressed Smad3 may improve wound healing through accelerated epithelialization in chronic wounds.

AB  - Introduction:? Early excision and closure is standard for severe burn management. Cadaver skin is generally used as temporary coverage if autograft donor sites are inadequate. However, it is associated with an inherent risk of antigenicity and infection and has a limited shelf life and availability. Use of Integra?, a dermal substitute, is well established for postburn reconstruction, but its efficacy as primary coverage for severe burns it is not well documented. Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy of Integra? as an acute cover. Method:? Twenty children with >40 total body surface area (TBSA) burn, were randomized to be grafted with Integra? or with the autograft-allograft technique. Short-term outcome measures such as length of hospital stay, mortality, incidence of infection/sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic indexes were compared between and within groups before and after Integra?/graft application. Long-term outcome measures such as number of reconstructive procedures and blinded scar scoring were performed up to 2 years postinjury. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired t-test. Values are expressed as Mean?±?SEM and significance accepted at p?<?0.05. Results:? There were no significant differences between groups, in burn size (Controls 74?±?4% and Integra? 70?±?5%), mortality (Control 30%, Integra? 40%), length of hospital stay (Control 39?±?4 days, Integra? 41?±?4 days), and metabolic rates. In addition, there was no significant incidence of infection or sepsis in the Integra? group compared to controls. Long-term follow-up (Integra n?=?5, control n?=?5) revealed a significantly improved scar, in terms of height, thickness, vascularity, and maturity, in the Integra? group compared to the control group, at 12 months and 18?24 months postburn, (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Integra? can be safely used for immediate wound coverage in children with severe burns, with better functional and aesthetic outcomes up to 2 years postinjury.

AB  - A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study of diabetic foot ulcers was conducted to answer questions of safety and impact on wound healing of a noncontact ultrasound device. Standard of care included moist dressings, debridement, offloading, and adequacy vascular supply for both groups. Patients were randomized to receive a saline mist or 40?KHz ultrasound therapy delivered to the wound bed using the spray as the coupler. The study was 12 weeks in duration or until the wound closed. Sixty-six patients were entered with intent to treat. Fifty-five patients were evaluable and constitute the outcomes of the study. MIST therapy resulted in 42.3% rate of healing versus 14.3% for sham treated significant at 0.028 Chi square. Kaplan Meier survival plots resulted in p?<?0.0087?log rank and p?<?0.011 Wilcoxon. Rate of wound closure was 22% faster with MIST compared to sham treated patients. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to adverse events in any category (mild, moderate, or severe) MIST ultrasound therapy is a new, safe, novel FDA-cleared device that improves diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to standard of care. Details of the study will be presented. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by Celleration Inc. Eden Prairie, MN.

AB  - Introduction:? Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) expression is up-regulated during wound healing. CyC-AP deletion causes greater expression of TNFα, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 during cutaneous repair. Furthermore, CyC-AP is a mediator for fibronectin-fragment induced MMP-13 expression. In order to understand the effects of the deletion of CyC-AP at the cellular level, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways of CyC-AP null and wild-type mice during skin wound healing. Methods:? Two-month-old CyC-AP null or wild-type mice were anesthetized and two 0.6?cm diameter excisional skin wounds were made on the dorsum of each mouse. Wounds were collected up to 10 days after injury. Total protein was purified from each wound and the protein expression of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), integrin beta 1, ERK 1, ERK 2, p38, PCNA, and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) was analyzed by immunoblot. Results:? TNFα expression was higher in CyC-AP null mice in unwounded skin. However, the elevated TNFα in CyC-AP null wounds was lower compared to the wild-type mice. To further understand the relationship of CyC-AP and TNFα, TACE expression was examined. TACE expression was less in the skin of CyC-AP null mice compared to wild-type mice. Expression of p38 and PCNA increased while sm-actin decreased in both unwounded and wounded CyC-AP null skin compared to wild type. PCNA expression in CyC-AP null fibroblasts was also higher compared to wild type, supporting our in vivo observations. In addition, the expression of integrin beta 1 was lower during wound healing. Conclusion:? The increased PCNA and decreased sm-actin expression suggests that CyC-AP null fibroblasts have higher proliferation and lower differentiation rates compared to wild types. These effects might be regulated through the p38 signaling pathway, which was increased in CyC-AP null mice. The decreased TACE expression in CyC-AP null skin suggests CyC-AP may also regulate TACE via the altered expression of integrin beta 1. Our data suggest CyC-AP is involved in TNFα activation.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that cyclic mechanical stretching exerts anti-inflammatory effects on rabbit chondrocytes. But whether mechanical stretching has similar effects on human tendon fibroblasts are not known. This study therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretching regulates IL-1? induced COX-2 gene expression in a stretching magnitude-dependent manner. In custom-made silicone dishes, human patellar tendon fibroblasts (HPTFs) were grown on microgrooved culture surfaces, with which the shape and organization of HPTFs in vivo were closely mimicked. To induce inflammatory responses in HPTFs, 10?pM of IL-1? was added to the culture medium. A 4% or 8% cyclic uniaxial stretching was then applied to silicone dishes for 4?hrs using a custom-design stretching apparatus. After the end of stretching, total RNA of stretched and nonstretched tendon fibroblasts was collected, and RT-PCR was performed for measuring COX-2?mRNA expression levels. We found that tendon fibroblasts subjected to 4% stretching decreased COX-2?mRNA expression level by 20%(p?=?0.0002; n?=?6) compared to that of nonstretched, IL-1?-treated cells. However, cells subjected to 8% stretching showed a 39% increase (p?=?0.007, n?=?6) in COX-2?mRNA expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that small stretching (4%) has anti-inflammatory effects on HPTFs in a mildly inflammatory environment such as that induced by 10?pM of IL-1?. In contrast, large stretching (8%) may amplify inflammatory responses of tendon fibroblasts. Therefore, physical therapy with low levels of tendon stretching may be beneficial in reducing mild tendon inflammation. Supported by the Arthritis Investigator Award and NIHAR049921 (JHW)

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
