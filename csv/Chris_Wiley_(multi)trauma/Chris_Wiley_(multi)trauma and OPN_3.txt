AB  - Abstract Poly-(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) has been widely investigated as scaffold material for bone tissue engineering owing to its biosafety, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. However, the bioinert surface of PLGA may fail in regulating cellular behavior and directing osteointegration between the scaffold and the host tissue. In this article, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (oCS) and type I collagen (Col I) were assembled onto PLGA surface via layer by layer technique (LbL) as an adhesive coating for the attachment of inorganic minerals. The multilayer-modified PLGA scaffold was mineralized in vitro to ensure the deposition of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP). It was found that nHAP crystals were more uniformly and firmly attached on the multilayer-modified PLGA as compared with the pure PLGA scaffold, which remarkably improved PLGA surface and mechanical properties. Additionally, in vitro biocompatibility of PLGA scaffold, in terms of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) attachment, spreading and proliferation was greatly enhanced by nHAP coating and multilayer deposition. Furthermore, the fabricated composite scaffold also shows the ability to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the up-regulation of osteogenic marker genes. Thus, this novel biomimetic composite scaffold might achieve a desirable therapeutic result for bone tissue regeneration. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence?2b What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Tumour in a solitary functioning kidney represents an absolute indication for nephron-sparing surgery whenever technically feasible. We report the longest follow-up data comparing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic cryoablation in patients with solitary kidney with oncological follow-up to five years. OBJECTIVES ??We compare perioperative, functional and intermediate-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) vs laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) for small renal tumour in patients with a solitary kidney. ??A treatment algorithm is also proposed. PATIENT AND METHODS ??Over a 10-year period (02/1998-09/2008), 78 patients with a small tumour in a functionally solitary kidney underwent LPN (n= 48) or LCA (n= 30). ??Baseline, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS ??Demographic data were similar between the LPN and LCA groups. Tumours were somewhat larger (3.2 vs 2.6?cm) in the LPN group. LPN was associated with greater blood loss (391 vs 162?mL; P= 0.003), and trended towards more post-operative complications (22.9% vs 6.7%; P= 0.07). ??By 3 months post-operative, eGFR decreased by 14.5% and 7.3% after LPN and LCA, respectively (P= 0.02). Post-operative temporary dialysis was required after 3 LPN (6.2% vs 0%, P= 0.16). ??Median follow-up time for LPN and LCA was 42.7 and 60.2 months, respectively. ??Local recurrence was detected in 4 (13.3%) LCA patients only (P= 0.02). ??Overall survival was comparable between LPN and LCA at 3 and 5 years, respectively (P= 0.74). The LPN group had superior cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years compared to the LCA group (P < 0.05, for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS ??Given adequate technical expertise, both LPN and LCA are viable nephron-sparing options for patients with tumour in a solitary kidney. ??Although LCA is technically easier and has superior functional outcomes, oncologic outcomes are superior after LPN.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.
