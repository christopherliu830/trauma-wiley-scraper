AB  - We are studying in the role of endogenous electric fields in mammalian skin wound healing. The epidermis generates a transepithelial potential (TEP) of 20?50?mV across itself, inside positive. Any wound or break in the epidermis creates a low resistance pathway and the TEP at the wound site is 0?mV. However, the TEP of the intact epidermis around the wound is still present, resulting in a lateral voltage gradient or electric field along the skin surrounding the wound. We have evidence that this lateral electric field stimulates keratinocytes in the area to migrate towards the wound with the optimal response occurring at a field strength of 100?mV/mm. In order to determine the actual field strength present in mammalian wounds, we have developed a new instrument called the Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI). The BFI vibrates a small sensor perpendicular to the skin about 200??m above the surface and uses the capacitance signal to determine the surface potential of the epidermis just beneath the stratum corneum. By measuring this surface potential in many positions around the wound, we generate a spatial map of the surrounding electric field. We have measured the wound field near a 1?mm long, full thickness skin wound in mice. A field of 100?200?mV/mm is present immediately following wounding and persists until wound healing is complete. The topical application of a blocker of Na+ channels (amiloride) reduces this wound field by about 50%, supporting the hypothesis that it is generated by the TEP. Preliminary measurements on human skin wounds detect lateral electric fields that are similar to those measured in mice. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Tissue repair and wound healing are complex processes that involve inflammation, granulation, and tissue remodeling. Angiogenesis plays a central role in wound healing. Previously, we have shown that picroliv, a natural product obtained from the roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and insulin like growth factor (IGF) in rats during hypoxia (Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 1999; 56: 348?55). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of Picroliv in an ex vivo rat aorta ring model of angiogenesis. Picroliv enhanced the sprouting and migration of endothelial cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of picroliv in both unimpaired and dexamethasone (DX)-induced impaired cutaneous healing in a full thickness punch wound model in rats. The animals in the impaired healing group having been pretreated with DX. We studied the tissues by histology and morphometry. The data showed picroliv treatment resulted in improved reepithelialization, neovascularization, and migration of various cells such as endothelial, dermal myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts into the wound bed. Immunohistochemical localization showed an increased VEGF and alpha smooth muscle actin staining consistent with increased number of micro vessels in granulation tissue. These findings suggest that picroliv accelerated wound repair and thus could be developed as a therapeutic angiogenic agent for the wound healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. In biocompatibility tests these fibers are nonimmunogenic. Fiber diameter can be manipulated over a wide range by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions. Table 1 illustrates average fiber diameters and pore dimensions achieved under different conditions. Collagen Concentration Fiber Diameter Pore Area 40?mgs/ml TFE ???113?±?51?nm ????184?±?87.6?nm2 60?mgs/ml TFE ???304?±?120?nm ?1,311?±?384?nm2 80?mgs/ml TFE ???761?±?276?nm ?4,913?±?3978?nm2 100?mgs/ml TFE ???745?±?314?nm ?5,039?±?2947?nm2 120?mgs/ml TFE 1,534?±?448?nm 19,154?±?20809?nm2 We prepared four 1?cm2 full thickness dermal injuries on the dorsum of the guinea pig. Electrospun scaffolds composed of different fiber diameters were cut to fit the defects, sutured in place and then recovered at 7 and 14 days. Injuries treated with scaffolds composed of electrospun collagen fibers greater than 300?nm in diameter exhibited extensive tongue formation, dense dermal cell infiltration and functional capillary beds. Dermal regeneration was substantially complete by 14 days. Scaffolds prepared with individual fiber diameters of less than 300?nm were well epithelialized but, less densely 'populated by dermal fibroblasts and capillaries. Fibrils of electrospun gelatin, a collagen isolate that is heat denatured prior to electrospinning, lack the banded appearance of electrospun collagen. Scaffolds of electrospun gelatin were less densely infiltrated than electrospun collagen at all fiber diameters and pore dimensions, and induced inflammation. We conclude that banded fibrils of electrospun collagen have unique biological activity. Funded in part NIH R01 EB003087. US & International Patents Issued and Pending.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars can be reduced by application of silicone dressing; however, the detailed mechanism of silicone action is still unknown. It is known that silicone gel sheets cause a hydration of the epidermal layer of the skin. An in vitro coculture experiment has shown that hydration of keratinocytes has a suppressive effect on the metabolism of the underlying fibroblasts resulting in reduced collagen deposition. We tested the hypothesis that silicone gel sheeting in vivo has a beneficial effect on scar reduction by a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation, with a resulting reduction in dermal thickness. Silicone adhesive gel sheets were applied to scars in our rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring 14 days post wounding for a total of 14 days. Scarring was measured in this model by the Scar Elevation Index (SEI), a ratio of the scar height over normal skin, and the Epidermal Thickness Index (ETI), a ratio of the epidermal height of the scar over normal epidermis. Ultrastructural changes were investigated using electron microscopy (EM). SEIs were significantly reduced after only 2-week applications of silicone gel sheets versus untreated scars (1.18?±?0.05 vs. 1.45?±?0.09, respectively; P?<?0.05)? corresponding to a 48.8% reduction of scar hypertrophy. The epidermal layer in scars was in general thicker than in unwounded skin. However, ETIs of untreated scars increased by 103% versus 71% after silicone gel treatment ? corresponding to a significant reduction of epidermal thickness by 24.4%. EM showed a basal layer in untreated scars that was very different than normal skin with many vacuoles at the basement membrane level, while silicone gel-treated scars had a basal cell layer which resembled unwounded epidermis. Our findings demonstrate that 2 weeks of silicone gel application at a very early onset of scarring reduces dermal thickness which appears to be due to a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation. These findings are consistent with our coculture results.

AB  - Fibroblasts from a healing ligament likely have differential phenotypical expression from those in an intact ligament, because fibroblasts at the healing site need to repair/regenerate the wounded matrix around them caused by injury, whereas normal fibroblasts just maintain an intact matrix. This study was designed to determine the differences in proliferation, collagen production, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, and contraction between healing and normal fibroblasts. Transected and sham-operated rat medial collateral ligaments (MCL) were used to obtain healing and normal fibroblasts, respectively. It was noted that healing and normal MCL fibroblasts in culture were seen to have a similar morphology. However, healing fibroblasts in monolayer culture proliferated 1.4-fold faster at 48 hours and had 1.7-fold greater protein expression of α-SMA than normal fibroblasts. In addition, it was noted that the proliferation of healing fibroblasts in collagen gels was not significantly different from that of normal fibroblasts at 24 hours, but it was at 48 hours. Furthermore, in collagen gels, healing fibroblasts produced 10% more type I collagen than normal fibroblasts and generated 1.6- and 1.7-fold larger contractile forces at 15 and 20 hours, respectively, than their normal counterparts. Taken together, the results of this study show that healing fibroblasts possess a differential proliferation, α-SMA protein expression, and contraction than normal fibroblasts. This study also highlights the importance of using healing fibroblasts to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ligament healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. Fiber diameter and porosity can be manipulated over a wide range simply by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions (Table). Collagen Concentration Fiber Diameter Pore Area 40?mg/ml TFE 113?±?51?nm 184?±?87.6?nm2 60?mg/ml TFE 302?±?74?nm 1,598?±?1,272?nm2 80?mg/ml TFE 909?±?272?nm 4,420?±?3,193?nm2 100?mg/ml TFE 1,389?±?446?nm 10,950?±?9,758?nm2 120?mg/ml TFE 1,533?±?448?nm 24,032?±?32,581?nm2 To examine how fiber diameter regulates microvascular endothelial cell migration/infiltration into a tissue engineering scaffold of electrospun collagen, we conducted in vitro migration assays. Electrospun scaffolds were prepared, cut into disks (150?300 microns thick), seeded with human microvascular endothelial cells and recovered at intervals. Varying fiber diameter from 100 to 2000?nm induced the expression of three distinct phenotypes. Scaffolds composed of fibers less than 300?nm in diameter exhibited a confluent layer of flat, stellate-shaped cells at all time points. The bulk of the cells were confined to the scaffold surface. At intermediate fiber diameters (300?nm?900?nm) the cells displayed a more rounded cell shape. By day 3 aggregates of these cells were clustered throughout scaffold in a capillary-like pattern. In scaffolds prepared with large diameter fibers (>1000?nm) the cells displayed an elongated, fusiform cell-shape and appeared to be uniformly scattered throughout the scaffold. These results parallel our in vivo studies that suggest fiber diameters of less than 300?nm reduce, but do not completely suppress, the infiltration of endothelial cells in a full thickness dermal injury model in the guinea pig.

AB  - The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) system has been characterized as the principal tissue level response to hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of HIF-1alpha has been reported to act though a Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) promoter region on a range of hypoxia-induced genes. A plasmid was constructed consisting of a fivefold HRE repeat conjugated to a luciferase gene, used as a marker for HRE activation. Plasmid HRE-luciferase was then transfected into a well-established ischemic rabbit ear wound healing model. Ischemia was induced using a variety of published models for interruption of arterial inflow and compared with a nonischemic control. Central artery, caudal artery and rostrocaudal artery models were tested for induction of ischemia. Tissue specimens were harvested from the transfected areas and solubilized. Luminescence of each specimen was measured using a standard luminometer to quantify luciferase induction. To provide correlation on a regional level, tissue level oxygen tension was measured directly for each wound model. Profound and statistically significant differences were found in the induced luciferase production. Marked differences in the tissue hypoxia between the various ischemic wound healing models correlated in graded fashion with the ischemia induced on an anatomic basis. The least ischemic model showed no significant difference in hypoxia readings versus control. The intermediate model showed a significant fourfold greater ischemia signaling. The most ischemic model showed a highly significant 72-fold greater ischemic response compared to controls. The use of gene transfection is described as a sensitive and effective method for quantification of tissue hypoxia at a cellular level in ischemic wounds. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Management of surgical defects following excisional and Mohs micrographic surgery for malignant skin lesions consists of autografting, skin flaps, primary closure, and healing by secondary intention. A fully differentiated bilayered cell-based therapy (BLCT/Apligraf), expresses multiple growth factors, provides a biologically active matrix, and appears to be immunologically inert. BLCT is FDA approved for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. BLCT is effective in hard-to-heal venous ulcers and, in diabetic foot ulcers, it is significantly associated with less amputations and osteomyelitis. A previous open-label trial showed BLCT to be safe and effective in surgical excision wounds. However, we have been interested in rigorously identifying differences in chronic compared to acute wounds when using BLCT or other skin substitutes. In this report of a multicenter randomized study, we enrolled and treated 181 patients eligible for secondary intention healing after Mohs or excisional surgery for skin cancer, with 172 completing the study. Face wounds were excluded. In total, 84 patients were treated with BLCT and 88 with dressings alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the quality of the healed wound using the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS). Pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and scar heights were assessed by the investigator and an independent observer as 0 (no scar) to 15 (worst scar). Scores of?≤?4 were assigned to 57 (65%) of BLCT-treated patients by both the investigator and observer, and to 60 (65%) and 54 (58%) of control patients according to the investigator and observer, respectively. There was no difference in healing time, and no severe adverse events or rapid cancer recurrence were observed in either group. In this randomized controlled trial of full thickness excision wounds after skin cancer removal, BLCT/Apligraf was safe and well tolerated.

AB  - Background:? The cytokine signals that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and the resulting reorganization of matrix are incompletely understood. We studied the response of fibroblasts to mediators known to affect matrix reorganization, TGF-? and TNF-α in a collagen matrix. Further, we sought to determine if any cell phenotype changes resulted in quantifiable alterations in the mechanical performance of the matrix. Methods:? Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen type I lattices for 1 and 5 days in DMEM with .5% FBS and TGF-?(1?ng/ml), TNF-α(10?ng/ml), or combinations TGF-?(1?ng/ml)?+?TNF-α(1,5, and 10?ng/ml). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine α-SMA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure α-SMA mRNA. An indentation mechanical method was used to measure Young?s modulus which represents matrix stiffness. Results:? TGF-? increases α-SMA, while TNF-α alone has no effect on basal α-SMA expression. When TGF-??+?TNF-α were both added, the expression of α-SMA returned to basal levels. Immunohistochemistry showed α-SMA is incorporated into prominent stress fibers only in the TGF-? group. Real-time PCR showed that TNF-α did not affect α-SMA mRNA, while TGF-? increased α-SMA mRNA 19-fold. Combination treatment reduced mRNA level by 16-fold, to 2.7-fold compared to control. Indentation testing showed that, in all treatment groups, lattices after 5 days in culture were stiffer. TNF-α appeared to reduce the stiffness of the lattices on both day 1 and 5 compared to control. Conclusion:? TNF-α decreases TGF-? induction of α-SMA expression at the transcriptional level and decreases lattice stiffness. The cellular responses to cytokines are reflected in both biochemical and mechanical behaviors. Understanding both will be necessary to understand how tissues remodel into functional tissue and scar.

AB  - Introduction:? Liposomal gene transfer is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of several pathophysiologic states. The purpose of the present study was to define whether the biological or chemical structure of a liposome influences cellular and biological regeneration in the skin and to determine by which mechanisms possible changes occur. Methods:? Rats were inflicted a full-excision acute wound and divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of DMRIE liposomes plus the Lac-Z gene, or DOTAP/Chol liposomes plus the Lac Z gene, or saline. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical 'techniques were used to determine molecular mechanisms after gene transfer, protein expression, dermal, and epidermal regeneration. Results:? DOTAP/Chol increased IGF-I and KGF protein concentration and caused concomitant cellular responses, e.g., by increasing IGFBP-3, p?<?0.05. DOTAP/Chol liposomes improved epidermal regeneration by exhibiting the most rapid area and linear wound reepithelization compared to DMRIE or control, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol and DMRIE exerted promitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on basal keratinocytes, p?<?0.05. Dermal regeneration was improved in DOTAP/Chol treated animals by an increased collagen deposition and morphology, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol liposomes increased VEGF concentrations and thus neovascularization when compared with DMRIE and saline, p?<?0.001. Summary:? In the present study we showed that different liposomes have different effects on intracellular and biological responses based on its chemical and molecular structure. For gene transfer in acute wounds the administration of DOTAP/Chol liposomes appears to be beneficial. Acknowledgments:? Clayton Foundation for Research

AB  - Introduction:? As an initial pilot effort a prospective, case-controlled trial examining the effects of treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?), by continuous, subcutaneous infusion, was performed in diabetic patients with recalcitrant lower extremity wounds. While the primary outcomes for the trial were wound healing and limb preservation, evaluation of local tissue perfusion with transcutaneous oximetry and laser Doppler analysis (TcPO2/LD) were included as secondary objectives, and with the expectation they would be useful monitors of any interventional modality. Methods:? All patients enrolled had nonhealing wounds (>3 months) in critically ischemic lower extremities (Fontaine Stage III-IV or Rutherford Stage 4, 5, or 6). Hyperbaric oxygen exposures were included as diagnostic/monitoring indices. In the last four enrolled subjects TcPO2/LD measurements were made at ambient pressure and at 2.0 or 2.4 ATA before Remodulin? was begun and at various points during drug infusion. Results:? Early, observational evaluation of the TcPO2/LD data shows: 1?? These examinations prognostically profile healing in ischemic limbs. 2?? TcPO2/LD values demonstrate the efficacy of Remodulin? in augmenting perfusion in ischemic wounds. While there is a broad range, all measured parameters increased on the drug (resting TcPO2 ? 5?30?mmHg, the rate of TcPO2 rise following ambient pressure O2-challenge ? 25?150% and periwound TcPO2 ? 90?300?mmHg at 2.0 and 2.4 ATA). 3?? The in-chamber TcPO2 on Remodulin? further defines patients who will not benefit from HBO2 therapy. 4?? The TcPO2/LD data will assist in determining dosages, duration, and maintenance requirements for this drug both as a single agent and when used as an adjuvant to HBO2 therapy. Conclusions:? Treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?) has significant laudatory effects on local wound perfusion in ischemic lower extremities. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Venous leg ulcers are characterized by chronic inflammation and in consequence high extracellular matrix turnover, avoiding epithelialization. In this work we evaluated maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder versus standard care for the topical treatment of noninfected venous leg ulcers, smaller than 25?cm2. All patients received daily micronized diosmin/hesperidin and they were recommended an appropriate diet, an exercise program, cleaning of the ulcer, etc., except for compression stocking, since they are not available in the clinic. Both treatments were administered daily during 12 weeks. Clinically, most of the patients were colonized by Staphylococcus aureus; patients who received maltodextrin/ascorbic acid reported less pain than controls and they improved significantly twice and thrice the lesion size in weeks 8 and 12, respectively, when compared with the standard care, (% wound closure: maltodextrin group 78.7?±?21.6 vs. standard care 36.7?±?45.4). In order to know changes in cytokine expression in the wound fluid, ulcers were covered with an impermeable film for 24?h, at the beginning and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and the fluids were tested for IL-1?, TNF-α, IL-10, and PDGF-AB by ELISA. Important changes in wound closure were observed when TNF-α and IL-10 changed, increasing their expression in maltodextrin group, meanwhile those cytokines were diminished in the controls. Finally, histological assessment was performed from the two biopsies taken before and after 8 weeks of treatment to each patient. Type III collagen showed an increase, but type I collagen decreased in the tissues derived from maltodextrin group, opposite to the data obtained from standard care group. In conclusion, maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder is an important topical treatment for chronic wounds, and it has demonstrated to improve wound closure when it was compared with the standard of care, even without compression.

AB  - One of the well-known enzymatic debriders is a papain?urea-chlorophyllin ointment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this ointment compared with single variable Papain-urea, Copper chlorophyllin, or Urea base ointment and moist wound care in porcine full thickness wounds. Twenty full thickness wounds were made on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria, treated with test articles, and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 18, and 21 days postsurgery visually and biopsies were obtained for microscopy. The results showed no impairment in the rate of epithelialization of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin treatment, nor with single variable actives compared with moist wound care. Microscopic examination revealed an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain-treated wounds, and an increase in the depth of rete pegs. Blood vessel formation was increased in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin, papain, and Copper chlorophyllin groups compared to the moist control tissue as seen with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining, and was most evident in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin-treated tissues. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wounds treated with papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain compared to vehicle, indicating a possible mechanism for neovascularization. The increase was not seen in the Copper chlorophyllin group, indicating the possibility of another mechanism for blood vessel formation in this group. The healing appears to be most complete in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin group based on epidermal morphology and enhanced vascularization, which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - The pathophysiology of wound repair is a delicately balanced, dynamic process involving both stimulatory and degradative factors to remove damaged tissue and synthesize new tissue. An imbalance of any of these factors may result in the formation of a chronic wound. Previous studies have indicated that the chronic wound environment is detrimental to cell and cytokine function, leading to delayed healing. The presence of a hostile chronic wound environment has been supported by many studies reporting elevated proteolytic activity in these wounds. However, it has not been determined if this elevation is due to an excess of a particular protease or a reduction in inhibitor levels. In this study we investigated the effect of PROMOGRANTM, a protease 'modulating matrix, on wound healing in patients with venous leg ulcers and examined the effect on the wound environment. Wound fluid samples were collected from a number of patients throughout the course of treatment and both protease and inhibitor levels were analyzed. Our results indicate that wounds which respond to PROMOGRANTM also exhibited an overall decrease in human neutrophil-derived elastase and MMP activity. An increase in the ratio of alpha-1-antitrypsin to human neutrophil-derived elastase was also observed suggesting a greater degree of regulation post therapy, and a return to a more acute-like wound environment. Wounds that did not respond to this treatment demonstrated a greatly reduced ratio, signifying a persistent excess of proteolytic activity and a continued delay in healing. It is unclear whether the observed biochemical changes in the wound environment are responsible for healing or merely symptomatic of the disease state. We have, however, shown that an overall reduction in proteolytic activity is concomitant with healing. This suggests that therapies that redress the balance of inhibitor to protease may be beneficial in treatment of chronic wounds.

AB  - Vulnerable populations generally have decreased access to health care, often present with advanced disease processes and experience poorer health outcomes compared to the general population. Here we report on the epidemiology and economics of a vulnerable population with chronic wounds served by an academic medical center that is the tertiary health care provider and referral center for the state of Mississippi. Data are being collected to determine if aggressive management and treatment improves health outcomes. The epidemiology of our population indicates that 48% are over 60 years of age; 45% are between 41?59 years of age; and 7% are under 40 years of age. About 61% are female and almost 39% male. Our vulnerable population is composed of 51.6% African Americans; 6.5% Native Americans; and 3.2% Hispanic Americans; with the remaining population or 38.7% Caucasian. The etiologies of wounds seen are 31% diabetic/neuropathic and 28.5% venous; followed by smaller percentages of surgically treated diabetic and venous wounds. We have found that this population commonly presents with a single wound, but that more than half (>50%) present with two or more wounds. A majority of these individuals (77%) visit the clinic more than two times, with most, or 44% visiting the clinic from two to five times. A smaller percentage, or about 30% visit the clinic six or more times. About 61% are either Medicare or Medicaid, or a combination, while the remainder are covered by private insurance (23%), workman?s compensation (3.2%), or are self-pay (12.9%). Despite this profile, the aggressive integration of a social worker in our clinic results in 35.5% being followed by home health. Thus, we will present data on whether the opening of a specialized treatment center results in better health outcomes in vulnerable populations once individuals receive appropriate referral and treatment.

AB  - We previously showed that Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, has profound effects on the process of wound healing by increasing both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of impaired porcine and murine repair. In the present study, using the scratch plate assay as an in vitro model of wound repair, we show that CRT (10?6?10?9?M) induces cell migration/wound closure in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts that is equivalent to EGF (positive control). Furthermore, by an MTS proliferation assay, CRT stimulated cellular proliferation of human keratinocytes (2-fold), fibroblasts (100-fold), and vascular endothelial cells (1.2-fold). Markedly increased cellular proliferation was confirmed by anti-ki67 immunostaining (IHC) which was confined to basal keratinocytes in the CRT-(5?mg/ml) treated porcine and murine wounds during reepithelialization and in numerous cells of the granulation tissue. Also, CRT increased dermal depth and granulation tissue formation between days 6?14 following injury (p?<?0.05). The effect of CRT on the dermal layer was qualitatively different than PDGF or PBS as there was a remarkably higher number of dermal cells that reconstituted the CRT-treated pig wounds, a more organized pattern of collagen organization by picrosirrius red staining, and greater fibronectin and TGF-?3 by IHC. CRT also increased tensile strength in a rat incisional wound model (p?<?0.005 @ 21 days). By Mac-138 IHC of porcine wounds, we observed an increase in macrophages in the wound bed compared to PDGF (p?<?0.013). Since the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is a CRT-dependent process, this finding suggests a potential role for CRT as a bacteriocidal and/or debriding agent. Unlike PDGF, CRT positively affects both the epithelial and dermal aspects of repair. Our studies suggest that CRT accelerates and improves the rate and quality of wound repair by affecting many cells involved in the repair process.

AB  - We have recently established a keratinocyte/fibroblast co-culture system and demonstrated a potent keratinocyte-derived antifibrogenic factor (KDAF) for dermal fibroblasts relative to that of control cells. Later experiments identified KDAF as being the keratinocytes releasable 14-3-3 sigma. It is also known as stratifin. In this study, we hypothesize that differentiated, but not proliferating, keratinocytes are the primary source of releasable 14-3-3 proteins in conditioned medium. We also suggested that fibroblasts are not the primary source of these proteins. To examine this hypothesis, in a longitudinal study, keratinocyte differentiation was induced by growing these cells in our test medium consist of 49% keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), 49% DMEM and 2% fetal bovine serum up to 24 days. When KCM was collected every other day and added to fibroblasts, the expression of collagenase mRNA was undetectable in cells receiving either fresh or 48?hr conditioned KSFM. However, the level of collagenase mRNA expression was markedly increased in fibroblasts receiving KCM collected at either early (day 2 and 4) or later (day 12?22) time points of replacing the KSFM with test medium. To examine whether fibroblasts also release different 14-3-3 isoforms, cultured conditioned media from both fibroblasts and keratinocytes were collected and evaluated for the presence of different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins by western blot analysis. The results revealed that fibroblasts which are highly responsive to some of the 14-3-3 isoforms such as α/? and σ forms, are barely able to express and release these factors into conditioned medium. This was in sharp contrast to a very high level of 14-3-3 proteins found in KCM. In conclusion, keratinocytes, but not fibroblasts, release different forms of 14-3-3 proteins which may function as MMP-1 stimulating factors for fibroblasts. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Extended healing time and lack of documented effective treatments of sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease create substantial problems. Locally applied zinc oxide has been reported to promote wound healing. We have compared topical zinc oxide (3%) with placebo meshes for pilonidal wounds healing by secondary intention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Sixty-four consecutive patients, 53 males, aged between 18 and 60 years (median 26 years) with excised pilonidal wounds were centrally randomized to local zinc oxide (30?mg/g, n?=?33) or to placebo (n?=?31) mesh treatment. Patients were followed with strict recording of beneficial and harmful effects. The median healing times were 54 days (42?71 days, interquartile range, n?=?33) for the zinc group and 62 days (55?82 days, n?=?31) for the placebo group. This difference was not statistically different (p?=?0.32). Based on Cox regression analysis initial wound volume influenced healing negatively (p?=?0.016) while smoking (p?=?0.011) was associated with faster wound healing. Significantly (p?<?0.01) more placebo (n?=?12) than zinc oxide-treated patients (n?=?3) needed antibiotics postoperatively. Although topical zinc oxide increased (p?<?0.001) wound fluid zinc levels (1830?±?405??M, mean?±?SEM) compared with placebo (3.1?±?1.6??M) serum-zinc levels did not differ significantly between the zinc (13.5?±?0.4??M) and placebo (12.8?±?0.4??m) groups on postoperative day 7. No adverse events were recorded. Topical zinc oxide treatment did not accelerate time to closure of open pilonidal wounds but was associated with reduced antibiotic usage.

AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.
