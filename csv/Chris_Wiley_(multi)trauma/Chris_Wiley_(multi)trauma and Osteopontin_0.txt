AB  - Abstract The secreted glycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) sets into motion an astounding variety of activities that range from bone remodeling via immunomodulation to the inhibition of apoptosis. In the current issue of the European Journal of Immunology, OPN now also enters mast cell biology and the regulation of IgE-dependent immune responses since it is reported that connective tissue-type mast cells from fetal murine skin constitutively secrete biologically active OPN. Moreover, it is shown that, in vitro, OPN augments IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and migration via ligand binding to cognate OPN receptors on the mast cell surface (CD44, αv integrin) and that the magnitude of an IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction is augmented by OPN in vivo. Here, we discuss why this newly discovered property of OPN fits well into the emerging concept that OPN may serve as a multi-purpose environmental damage-response protein.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is a common complication of diabetes resulting in significant clinical morbidity. The diabetic wound exhibits impaired cellular infiltration and consequently inadequate granulation tissue formation. Additionally, altered patterns of apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the differential gene expression pattern in transgenic diabetic female mice, 5?6 weeks old, in a full thickness cutaneous punch wound model. We assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and differential gene expression pattern at 4th, 7th and 11th day post wounding. Supernatants obtained from diabetic wound tissue homogenates were subjected to zymogram analysis. The data showed that MMPs were expressed at higher level by 4th day post wounding, whereas expression of MMPs were down regulated towards the 11th day post wounding suggesting their role during early phase of wound healing. The pathway specific gene array data demonstrated differential regulation of several growth factors, transcription factors and other related genes such as fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, ID3 and restin respectively. The cytokine/extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), an important component of cellular immunity and inflammation also showed higher expression after 4 days post wounding. The expression of OPN remained at higher level after 11 days post wounding in diabetic mice, whereas the expression were down regulated to basal level in normal wounded animal suggesting that the expression of OPN was concomitant with the extent of healing. Other adhesion molecules such as integrin αV and PECAM-1 were also differentially regulated. Though a single gene may not be solely responsible for any defect or impairment in healing as it is a very tightly controlled and regulated process, however, a detailed study of these gene(s) may shed some light to the delayed healing in diabetic mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

AB  - Abstract During the past two decades, with a huge and rapidly increasing clinical need for bone regeneration and repair, bone substitutes are more and more seen as a potential solution. Major innovation efforts are being made to develop such substitutes, some having advanced even to clinical practice. It is now time to turn to natural biomaterials. Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is an organic matrix-calcium carbonate coupled shell structure produced by molluscs. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that nacre is osteoinductive, osteoconductive, biocompatible, and biodegradable. With many other outstanding qualities, nacre represents a natural and multi-use biomaterial as a bone graft substitute. This review aims at summarising the current needs in orthopaedic clinics and the challenges for the development of bone substitutes; most of all, we systematically review the physiological characteristics and biological evidence of nacre's effects centred on osteogenesis, and finally we put forward the potential use of nacre as a bone graft substitute. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - Abstract The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in both the developing and adult brain by providing structural support and mediating cell-cell interactions. In this review, we focus on the major constituents of the ECM and how they function in both normal and injured brain, and summarize the changes in the composition of the ECM as well as how these changes either promote or inhibit recovery of function following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Modulation of ECM composition to facilitates neuronal survival, regeneration and axonal outgrowth is a potential therapeutic target for TBI treatment.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Understanding dentinogenesis and pulp regeneration during physiological and pathological conditions represents a real challenge in the provision of a suitable treatment that ideally leads to the induction of the pulp regenerative potential. This paper focusses on the early steps of dentin?pulp regeneration that appear to be critical after pulp capping procedures. Different models are described in this paper where the interactions between different cell types in vitro illustrate their role in maintaining pulpal homeostasis. After traumatic injuries, the cells modify the local pulpal microenvironment by secreting growth factors that orchestrate and induce the processes required for dentin?pulp regeneration. Applying dental materials onto the injured pulp modifies this local microenvironment and affects the potential for pulpal regeneration. The paper also describes the added value of developing an entire human tooth culture model for understanding these early steps and discusses the interest of its use in evaluating newly developed pulp capping materials through the example of BiodentineTM, developed as a dentin substitute. The growth factors sustained release simulating the local microenvironment is also discussed. Simulating the pulp local environment with a continuous growth factors release is also a basic requirement for establishing future pulp tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Study of cell-biomaterial interaction is a crucial aspect of bone tissue engineering to find a state-of-the-art functional substitute. In present study, the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) behavior on three-dimensional biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/gelatin (nHA/CS/Gel) scaffolds was investigated. The outcome was assessed by histological, biochemical and morphological tests. Results indicated that hWJ-MSCs attached onto the scaffold surface through membrane filopodia, uniformly spread throughout the contacting surface. It only took 3 days for the seeded cells to appear deep inside the scaffold, reflecting proper hWJ-MSCs adhesion and migration, evidenced by both scanning electron microscope and hematoxilin and eosin assessments. Additionally, the present fabricated nHA/CS/Gel scaffold proved to be non-toxic as it supported cell proliferation measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, 3-week culture of hWJ-MSCs on scaffolds, immersed in osteogenic medium, rendered the microenvironment in favor of hWJ-MSCs differentiation into osteoblast cells and extracellular matrix secretion. Finally, osteoblasts were immunologically positive for various osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase. Present findings indicate that nHA/CS/Gel scaffold appropriately harbored hWJ-MSCs, stimulating their growth, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. hWJ-MSCs-loaded nHA/CS/gel substitute may therefore be considered as a suitable platform for the rising demand in in vivo bone repair studies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The tyrosine kinase receptor, EphB4, mediates cross-talk between stromal and hematopoietic populations during bone remodeling, fracture repair and arthritis, through its interactions with the ligand, ephrin-B2. This study demonstrated that transgenic EphB4 mice (EphB4 Tg), over-expressing EphB4 under the control of collagen type-1 promoter, exhibited higher frequencies of osteogenic cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC), correlating with a higher frequency of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC), compared with wild type (WT) mice. EphB4 Tg stromal feeder layers displayed a greater capacity to support LTC-IC in vitro, where blocking EphB4/ephrin-B2 interactions decreased LTC-IC output. Similarly, short hairpin RNA-mediated EphB4 knockdown in human bone marrow stromal cells reduced their ability to support high ephrin-B2 expressing CD34+ HSC in LTC-IC cultures. Notably, irradiated EphB4 Tg mouse recipients displayed enhanced bone marrow reconstitution capacity and enhanced homing efficiency of transplanted donor hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells relative to WT controls. Studies examining the expression of hematopoietic supportive factors produced by stromal cells indicated that CXCL12, Angiopoietin-1, IL-6, FLT-3 ligand, and osteopontin expression were more highly expressed in EphB4 Tg stromal cells compared with WT controls. These findings indicate that EphB4 facilitates stromal-mediated support of hematopoiesis, and constitute a novel component of the HSC niche. Stem Cells 2015;33:2838?2849

AB  - Abstract The stability of orthopedic implants is governed by the interaction between the material's surface and bone cells. Nanosized structures seem to be promising in supporting the osseointegration of total joint replacements. In order to analyze whether nanostructured titanium surfaces, as generated by a short-pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser irradiation process developed in the aeronautics and space industry as a ?cold ablation? process, can be useful for orthopedic applications, their impact on bone cells is evaluated in vitro. Cell spreading and morphology on nanostructured titanium niobium nitride or titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces are comparable to osteoblast behavior on corresponding untreated titanium or cells grown on cover glass. However, on the nanostructured surfaces cell numbers appear to be reduced. Nonetheless, cell viability is not affected by laser pretreatment. Interestingly, osteoblast proliferation on nanostructured titanium is inhibited to the benefit of an increased production of osteoblast-specific proteins such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or procollagen. Furthermore, an enhanced mineralization of cells grown on nanostructured surfaces is confirmed in terms of an elevated hydroxyapatite deposition. Laser irradiation leads to an additional nanostructure on microstructured titanium surfaces and might positively affect the biocompatibility and ingrowth of prostheses made from the corresponding biomaterials.

AB  - Abstract Menaquinones, also known as Vitamin K2 family, regulate calcium homeostasis in a ?bone-vascular cross-talk? and recently received particular attention for their positive effect on bone formation. Given that the correlation between menaquinones and bone metabolism to date is still unclear, the objective of our study was to investigate the possible role of menaquinone-4 (MK-4), an isoform of the menaquinones family, in the modulation of osteogenesis. For this reason, we used a model of human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (hAFMSCs) cultured both in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D; RCCS?bioreactor) in vitro culture systems. Furthermore, to mimic the ?bone remodelling unit? in vitro, hAFMSCs were co-cultured in the 3D system with human monocyte cells (hMCs) as osteoclast precursors. The results showed that in a conventional 2D culture system, hAFMSCs were responsive to the MK-4, which significantly improved the osteogenic process through ?-glutamyl carboxylase-dependent pathway. The same results were obtained in the 3D dynamic system where MK-4 treatment supported the osteoblast-like formation promoting the extracellular bone matrix deposition and the expression of the osteogenic-related proteins (alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, collagen type-1 and osteocalcin). Notably, when the hAFMSCs were co-cultured in a 3D dynamic system with the hMCs, the presence of MK-4 supported the cellular aggregate formation as well as the osteogenic function of hAFMSCs, but negatively affected the osteoclastogenic process. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MK-4 supported the aggregate formation of hAFMSCs and increased the osteogenic functions. Specifically, our data could help to optimize bone regenerative medicine combining cell-based approaches with MK-4 treatment.

AB  - Abstract Delayed bone healing and non-union occur in approximately 10% of long bone fractures. Despite intense investigations and progress in understanding the processes governing bone healing, the specific pathophysiological characteristics of the local microenvironment leading to non-union remain obscure. The clinical findings and radiographic features remain the two important landmarks of diagnosing non-unions and even when the diagnosis is established there is debate on the ideal timing and mode of intervention. In an attempt to understand better the pathophysiological processes involved in the development of fracture non-union, a number of studies have endeavoured to investigate the biological profile of tissue obtained from the non-union site and analyse any differences or similarities of tissue obtained from different types of non-unions. In the herein study, we present the existing evidence of the biological and molecular profile of fracture non-union tissue.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal tissue regeneration is often required following trauma, where substantial bone or cartilage loss may be encountered and is a significant driver for the development of biomaterials with a defined 3D structural network. Solvent blending is a process that avoids complications associated with conventional thermal or mechanical polymer blending or synthesis, opening up large areas of chemical and physical space, while potentially simplifying regulatory pathways towards in vivo application. Here ternary mixtures of natural and synthetic polymers were solvent blended and evaluated as potential bone tissue engineering matrices for osteoregeneration by the assessment of growth and differentiation of STRO-1+ skeletal stem cells. Several of the blend materials were found to be excellent supports for human bone marrow-derived STRO-1+ skeletal cells and fetal skeletal cells, with the optimized blend exhibiting in vivo osteogenic potential, suggesting that these polymer blends could act as suitable matrices for bioengineering of hard tissues.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to develop single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLAGA) composites for orthopedic applications and to evaluate the interaction of human stem cells (hBMSCs) and osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells) via cell growth, proliferation, gene expression, extracellular matrix production and mineralization. PLAGA and SWCNT/PLAGA composites were fabricated with various amounts of SWCNT (5, 10, 20, 40, and 100?mg), characterized and degradation studies were performed. Cells were seeded and cell adhesion/morphology, growth/survival, proliferation and gene expression analysis were performed to evaluate biocompatibility. Imaging studies demonstrated uniform incorporation of SWCNT into the PLAGA matrix and addition of SWCNT did not affect the degradation rate. Imaging studies revealed that MC3T3-E1 and hBMSCs cells exhibited normal, non-stressed morphology on the composites and all were biocompatible. Composites with 10?mg SWCNT resulted in highest rate of cell proliferation (p?<?0.05) among all composites. Gene expression of alkaline phosphatase, collagen I, osteocalcin, osteopontin, Runx-2, and Bone Sialoprotein was observed on all composites. In conclusion, SWCNT/PLAGA composites imparted beneficial cellular growth capabilities and gene expression, and mineralization abilities were well established. These results demonstrate the potential of SWCNT/PLAGA composites for musculoskeletal regeneration and bone tissue engineering (BTE) and are promising for orthopedic applications. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Concern about the use of nanomaterials has increased significantly in recent years due to potentially hazardous impacts on human health. Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.

AB  - As one of the most important natural materials, cortical bone is a composite material comprising assemblies of tropocollagen molecules and nanoscale hydroxyapatite mineral crystals, forming an extremely tough, yet lightweight, adaptive and multi-functional material. Bone has evolved to provide structural support to organisms, and therefore its mechanical properties are vital physiologically. Like many mineralized tissues, bone can resist deformation and fracture from the nature of its hierarchical structure, which spans molecular to macroscopic length-scales. In fact, bone derives its fracture resistance with a multitude of deformation and toughening mechanisms that are active at most of these dimensions. It is shown that bone's strength and ductility originate primarily at the scale of the nano to submicrometer structure of its mineralized collagen fibrils and fibers, whereas bone toughness is additionally generated at much larger, micro- to near-millimeter, scales from crack-tip shielding associated with interactions between the crack path and the microstructure. It is further shown how the effectiveness with which bone's structural features can resist fracture at small to large length-scales can become degraded by biological factors such as aging and disease, which affect such features as the collagen cross-linking environment, the homogeneity of mineralization, and the density of the osteonal structures.
