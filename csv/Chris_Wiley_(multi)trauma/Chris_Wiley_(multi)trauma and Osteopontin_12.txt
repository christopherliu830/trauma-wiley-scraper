AB  - Titanium and its alloys are commonly used in almost all disciplines of medicine because of their sufficient biocompatibility and meeting of mechanical requirements. However, dense metallic biomaterials represent only an interfacial connection with host tissue, may develop stress shielding which causes ingrowth of the fibrous tissue, and are prone to microbial adhesion and development of biomaterial associated infections. Therefore, development of a new, porous titanium biomaterial is proposed to improve an implant's interconnection with bone, provide better stabilization, and reduce the risk of the loss of the implant. In this review, recent findings in porous titanium biomaterials engineering are discussed, including the structural and strengthening aspects of titanium alloys. The porosity and design of porous structures, as well as the optimization process are also described. An extensive part of this section is dedicated to manufacturing processes. The next section of the review is devoted to osseointegration of porous implants and surface treatment processes, whose purpose are antibacterial activity or local drug delivery. Summarizing the article, some future predictions have been presented.

AB  - Abstract Core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1) is an osteoblast-specific transcription factor essential to develop a mature osteoblast phenotype. However, its exact role in the signaling of various osteotropic-differentiating agents is still unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of 1,25-(OH)2-D3 (D3), ascorbic acid, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), dexamethasone (Dex), and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) on Cbfa1 and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA steady state levels (by semiquantitative RT-PCR) in an in vitro model of osteoblast differentiation. TGF-? increased Cbfa1 mRNA levels in normal primary human osteoblasts (pHOB) by 2.6-fold in a time-dependent fashion with maximum effect on day 28 (P?<?0.001). Similarly, the glucocorticoid Dex enhanced Cbfa1 gene expression by pHOB in a time-dependent fashion by up to 4.6-fold (P?<?0.001). In contrast, Dex inhibited OCN gene expression levels by 68% (P?<?0.01). Treatment with BMP-2 resulted in an earlier enhancement of Cbfa1 and led to a 4.2-fold increase with a maximum on day 21 (P?<?0.001). Ascorbic acid did not modulate Cbfa1 and OCN gene expression. The effect of vitamin D (D3) on Cbfa1 mRNA expression was influenced by the duration of treatment, being inhibitory after 1 h and having a stimulatory effect after 48 h. Time course experiments indicated a stimulatory effect of D3 on Cbfa1 mRNA levels (by 2.5-fold after 48 h; P?<?0.01). Analysis of the late cellular differentiation marker osteocalcin revealed that D3 increased OCN gene expression by 14-fold (P?<?0.001). In conclusion, in normal primary human osteoblasts, the rapid and pronounced increase of OCN after treatment with D3 seems not to be mediated by Cbfa1. These data imply that Cbfa1 gene expression is differentially regulated by various osteoblastic differentiating agents and is dependent on the stage of maturation. J. Cell.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: Mechanical properties of bones are greatly influenced by percentages of organic and mineral constituents. Nevertheless, information about mineralization level on a microscopic scale and collagen fiber organization in peri-implant bone after immediate loading is scarce. Purpose: The aim of this work was to analyze and compare the degree of mineralization and collagen fiber orientation in alveolar bone (AB) and peri-implant bone of immediately loaded (IL) and unloaded (NL) implants. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 dental implants of 3.8?mm in diameter and 11 mm in length were used in the present study. In five minipigs, three premolars and the first molar were removed from the left side of the mandible. Three months later, five implants for each animal were inserted. Four implants were loaded immediately with a fixed restoration, while one implant was left unloaded. After a 4-month healing period, all implants were retrieved. Circularly polarized light and scanning electron microscope with backscattered electron imaging were used to analyze both peri-implant and AB retrieved 5?mm from the implant. Results: The bone/implant contact ratio (BIC %) was 77.8?±?5.9% for the IL implants and 78.0?±?5.8% for the NL implants; the difference was not statistically significant (p?=?0.554). In the peri-implant bone, the area related to transverse collagen fibers was 112,453?±?4,605 pixels for IL implants and 87,256?±?2,428 pixels for NL implants. In the AB, the area related to transverse collagen fibers was 172,340?±?3,892 pixels. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p?<?.001). The degree of mineralization of peri-implant bone was 137?±?19 gray level for IL implants and 115?±?24 gray level for NL implants, while in the AB, the degree of mineralization was 125?±?26 gray level. This difference was statistically significant (p?<?.001). Conclusion: In this study, it was found that IL and NL implants showed the same degree of osseointegration. The bone matrix around IL implants had a higher quantity of transverse collagen fibers and presented a higher level of mineralization.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this review is to discuss the clinical utility of stem cells in periodontal regeneration by reviewing relevant literature that assesses the periodontal-regenerative potential of stem cells. We consider and describe the main stem cell populations that have been utilized with regard to periodontal regeneration, including bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the main dental-derived mesenchymal stem cell populations: periodontal ligament stem cells, dental pulp stem cells, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, stem cells from apical papilla and dental follicle precursor cells. Research into the use of stem cells for tissue regeneration has the potential to significantly influence periodontal treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract Plant derived flavonoids have not been well explored in tissue engineering applications due to difficulties in efficient formulations with biomaterials for controlled presentation. Here, the authors report that surface coating of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on polymeric substrates including poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers can be performed via oxidative polymerization of EGCG in the presence of cations, enabling regulation of biological functions of multiple cell types implicated in bone regeneration. EGCG coating on the PLLA nanofiber promotes osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and is potent to suppress adipogenesis of ADSCs while significantly reduces osteoclastic maturation of murine macrophages. Moreover, EGCG coating serves as a protective layer for ADSCs against oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. Finally, the in vivo implantation of EGCG-coated nanofibers into a mouse calvarial defect model significantly promotes the bone regeneration (61.52 ± 28.10%) as compared to defect (17.48 ± 11.07%). Collectively, the results suggest that EGCG coating is a simple bioinspired surface modification of polymeric biomaterials and importantly can thus serve as a promising interface for tuning activities of multiple cell types associated with bone fracture healing.

AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.
