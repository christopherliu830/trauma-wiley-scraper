AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - The aim of the present article is to discuss observations and hypotheses from different experimental approaches on the biological mechanisms underlying initiation of tertiary dentin formation and therapeutic control of pulp?dentinal regeneration. The specific dentinogenic potential of dental pulp cells in up-regulating the biosynthetic activity of primary odontoblasts (reactionary dentinogenesis) and differentiation into odontoblast-like cells (reparative dentinogenesis) is described. The role of biologically active matrices and molecules as signaling factors in the expression of the dentinogenic potential of dental pulp cells, in numerous ex vivo and in vivo models, is reviewed. Data are focused on the mechanisms by which the signaling molecules, in the presence of the appropriate pulp microenvironment and specific mechanical support, can induce competent pulpal cells in the acquisition of odontoblast-like cell phenotype and reparative dentin formation. The ability of tissue engineering to stimulate reconstruction of the amputated pulp?dentin complex offers exciting opportunities for the future. Advances in molecular biology and bioengineering research might thus be integrated into the clinical problems of endodontology.?Received 13 February 2009; accepted 2 September 2009.

AB  - Abstract Transplantable cell sheets containing osteoblasts were fabricated from periostea on temperature-responsive culture dishes. This study demonstrated the time-course of bone regeneration in living small animals. This continuous observation of bone regeneration was achieved by micro-computed tomography (µCT), which assessed the osteogenic capability of periosteal cells without biodegradable scaffolds. Real-time bone regeneration was non-invasively monitored in a rat calvarial bone defect model, using µCT. Three-dimensional (3D) images obtained over time by µCT clearly showed that two different bone regeneration modes, specific to the control and experimental groups, were observed. In the control group, bone was regenerated only from the periphery of the defect edges. In the experimental group, bone regeneration was observed in several small regions within the central portions of the defects that were covered by the transplanted cell sheets. However, bone regeneration observed after periosteal cell sheet transplantation was limited. The results of ALP staining and the time-course observations concluded that periosteal cell sheets contained a small fraction of cells that could differentiate osteoblasts. Fibroblasts in transplanted cell sheets or from around subcutaneous tissues suppressed bone regeneration. The periosteal cell sheets had a capability to produce ectopic regenerated bones. Therefore, to increase the content of osteogenic cells in harvested cell sheets, the enrichment of cells that could produce osteoblasts was expected by the modification of the initial cell preparation and the culture conditions. With further possible improvements, scaffold-free periosteal cell sheet fabricated on temperature-responsive culture dishes will be a valuable method for inducing and accelerating bone regeneration.

AB  - Research on abnormal scarring, such as excessive scars, has been hampered by the lack of relevant animal models. Recent studies suggest that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are stimulators of fibrosis or scarring. We developed a rabbit ear cutaneous excessive scarring model using the growth factor stimulators TGF-?1 (0.25, 0.5 or 1??g per wound), PDGF-BB (1, 2 or 3??g per wound) and FGF-2 (0.5, 1, 3 or 5??g per wound). Three 8-mm diameter wounds were created on each ear in NZW rabbits (n?=?6 wounds). The test growth factors were injected intradermally immediately after wounding. Controls consisted of PBS, BSA and wounding only without injections. Scar thickness of wounds was measured with a micrometer at days 14 and continued twice a week thereafter until sacrifice at day 28. Results showed that the greatest measurement of elevated scars was observed at day 14. Significant differences of scar thickness were observed in TGF-?1 at a dose of 0.25??g, PDGF-BB at a dose of 3??g, and FGF-2 at a dose of 3??g per wound groups when compared to PBS and wounding only groups (p?<?0.05). Interestingly, BSA, a protein stabilizer for TGF-?1 and FGF-2 proteins, also significantly elevated scar thickness at day 14 over PBS alone (p?<?0.05). Trichrome stained tissue sections on day 28 showed an increase in cellularity and thicker epithelium in all doses of TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 protein treated groups when compared to wounding only, PBS or BSA treatments. In general, FGF-2 treated wounds showed more vascularity than TGF-?1 and PDGF-BB treated wounds. By contrast, PDGF-BB treated wounds showed richer collagen deposition than TGF-?1 and FGF-2 treated wounds. Results from these studies demonstrated that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 contributed to the scar formation in the rabbit ear scar model. BSA may contribute in stimulating scar formation in the early stage of wound healing in this model. Enhancing elevated scar formation in the rabbit ear model will be useful in evaluating anti-scarring agents for excessive scars such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.

AB  - The complexity of cellular and molecular events that occur during wound healing is given by the rapid and continuous changes of matrix structure, cell population, local cytokine composition, nutrient and oxygen availabilities and overall metabolic activity. Angiogenesis is an essential event in the repair of injured tissue. Transcriptional events leading to wound neovascularization begin immediately after the injury has occurred and continue throughout the process until scar remodeling becomes quiescent. This study investigated progression of wound angiogenesis by quantitatively measuring transcripts of multiple genes that participate in wound angiogenesis. The studies were done using a murine model of bilateral 3?mm excision wounds. Wound tissues were collected from 6 hours up to 10 days post-wounding. Each time point consisted of 8 wounds pooled from four different mice. After RNA purification, the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probe/primer sets for selected transcripts that included the following groups: a) angiogenic factors; b) anti-angiogenic factors; c) receptors; d) cytokines and enzymes; e) matrix proteins; f) signaling molecules and transcription factors; g) apoptosis and proliferation markers; and h) housekeeping genes. A total of 58 genes were profiled including four housekeeping genes. The transcripts revealed several patterns of expression. Some genes such as angiopoietin 1(Ang1), e-selecting, placental growth factor (PlGF), MMP-9 and thrombospondin 1(TSP1) had a clear biphasic pattern where early peaks were detected within the first 24 hours after wounding and were followed by dowregulation and a second increase in transcription after several days. Other transcripts appeared early and had a sustained expression and they include fibroblast growth factor two (FGF2), FGF7, hypoxia inducile factor alpha (HIF-1a) and STAT3. Examples of late transcripts included HOXD3 and alpha smooth muscle actin. Results derived from this study largely confirm previous studies profiling a small number of individual genes such as VEGF, TSP1 and 2 and others. However, the present study integrates complete transcriptional profiles of large number of genes known to have a critical role in healing progression with a particular emphasis on revascularization. A more detailed model of event sequences that lead to tissue reperfusion after injury is derived from the results.

AB  - Many silver-dressings have been recently developed to prevent infection of burn and chronic wounds. Antimicrobial therapies are usually studied in in-vitro assays, which evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy against free-floating bacteria. In a wound environment bacteria attach to tissues and establish bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are communities of colonies of bacteria and other microorganisms encased in a self produced exopolymeric substance. Biofilms help protect the bacteria from the environment and limit the effectiveness of antimicrobials. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of two silver dressings to eradicate biofilm-associated and planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using our biofilm burn wound animal model. Three pigs were used in this study. Second-degree burn wounds were made on one-half of the animal?s back and inoculated with a burn wound isolate of P. aeruginosa. These wounds were then covered for 72 hours with a polyurethane dressing to allow biofilm formation. After 72 hours, additional burn wounds were made on the unwounded half of the animal. The new burns were then inoculated with the same P. aeruginosa strain. At this 72 hour point we had established two bacterial groups, one side of the animal had burns with planktonic bacteria and the other half with biofilm bacteria. Both sides of the animal were treated 20 minutes after inoculation of the planktonic group with the following dressings: 1) Nanocrystalline Silver, 2) Hydrocolloid Silver, or 3) untreated. Wounds were cultured from all treatment groups at 24, 48 and 72 hours post treatment. Sites were cultured quantitatively using a novel flush-scrub technique to obtain both planktonic and biofilm bacterial counts. The baseline biofilm bacterial count was 7.56 LogCFU/ml (prior to treatment). The hydrocolloid dressing significantly reduced planktonic bacteria counts as compared to untreated and nanocrystalline silver dressing at 24, 48 and 72 hours. However, biofilm bacteria counts for both dressings were similar to untreated control at all sample points. Our study demonstrates that both silver dressings showed limited effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated cells when compared to untreated wounds. Based on our results we question the effectiveness of silver dressings for infected wounds that are colonized with biofilm associated-cells. We conclude that anti-biofilm susceptibility models may improve on current antimicrobial sensitivity assays.

AB  - Biofilms are a combination of microorganisms and extrapolysaccharide matrices. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that biofilms are present in both acute and chronic wounds. Once biofilms are established, phagocytosis and diffusion of antibiotics are impaired thus contributing to antimicrobial resistance due to increased bacterial virulence. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents on partial thickness wounds containing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. All wounds were inoculated with 106?CFU/ml and covered for 48 hrs under a polyurthene film to promote biofilm formation. Wounds were divided into three treatment groups; triple antibiotic ointment (Polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc, neomycin), mupirocin cream and untreated control. Wounds were treated twice daily. Wounds were cultured for bacterial quantitation at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120?hrs. Significant reduction in CFU/ml was observed only after several days of treatments. This finding supports the antimicrobial resistance that occurs when bacteria live within biofilms. Our previous studies demonstrated that both of these agents were able to completely eliminate planktonic S. aureus(106) at the early time points. This study demonstrates that when bacterial biofilms are established in wounds there is a longer response time for topical antimicrobial activity suggesting bacterial resistance.

AB  - The inflammatory events of atherosclerosis involve monocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and several cytokines, including chemokines. Atherosclerosis begins with recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel injury. In the vessel wall, these cells are activated to become macrophages that scavenge toxic material such as oxidized LDL and transition into ?foam cells? which will eventually lead to plaque formation. Tobacco smoke is known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. The chemokine MCP-1 is involved in recruiting monocytes to the injured blood vessel wall and is commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. Our data show that both ?first-hand? and ?second-hand? cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 production in cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (EC), suggesting that cigarette smoke may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating aortic EC to produce MCP-1 in blood vessels after smoke injury. To test whether MCP-1 links smoking and cardiovascular disease, we are studying the expression of this molecule in mice that are either transgenic for human ApoB or are null for MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, by exposing the mice to smoke in a way that closely resembles human smoking. Blood samples from the mice were tested for carboxyhemoglobin, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and MCP-1 at successive weeks after initiation of smoking and the aortas isolated to analyze for plaque size and MCP-1 expression in the tissue. The carboxyhemoglobin test shows that the mice are exposed to smoke. Plasma MCP-1 and HDL levels are reduced in the smoking groups, whereas LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol remain unchanged. On one hand, the decrease in circulating HDL levels suggests that the reason smokers develop atherosclerosis may be because the rate of cholesterol clearance is slowed down. On the other hand, a decrease in circulating MCP-1 level may reflect that this chemokine accumulates in blood vessel walls, conferring stronger ability for attraction of monocytes. This work is supported by TRDRP and Phillip Morris.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine constitutively expressed in adipose tissue and upregulated by hypoxia in sites of tissue injury and in the placenta. Leptin has been demonstrated to play a role in normal and pathological wound healing and it is gene is acutely expressed in experimental wounds. Angiogenesis is among the most salient and well-documented biological actions of leptin. Therefore it was hypothesized that leptin may play in the modulation of wound neovascularization. Using a murine model of experimental wounds the modulation of wound angiogenesis was investigated by treatment of the wounds to either recombinant leptin or a neutralizing anti-leptin antibody. The parameters measured were: a)woundblood flow using laser Doppler imaging; b)vesseldensity by counting the number of CD-31 positive vessels in wound sections; c)angiogenic transcriptionalprofiling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR; and d)validation of transcriptionalprofiling by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The treatment of wounds with leptin had a marked effect in wound blood flow that was most significant at 24hours post-wounding with average increase of 55% with respect to the controls. The effect diminished significantly by 72 hours (24%) and became negligible thereafter. Leptin also accelerate wound neovascularization by 24 hours where the number of small caliber vessels averaged 30/mm2 in leptin treated vessels and 13/mm2 in the controls (n?=?10; P?<?0.005). However, the number of vessels measured by 72 hours not significantly different between controls and leptin-treated wounds. In addition transcriptional profiling reveled changes in gene expression of molecules related to angiogenesis such as VEGF, PlGF, Tie-1, Tie-2, Flt-1, Flk-1, FGF-2 and endothelial markers like CD-31, endoglin and eNOS. Overall, time course analysis throughout the healing process showed that leptin treatment induced an early shift in the expression of many of the analyzed transcripts. The most salient changes could be observed as early as 6 hours post-wounding and included: TSP-1 (+8.7); FLK-1(+9); Ang-2 (+18); CD31(+5.3); endoglin (+7.6); eNOS (+4.2); FGF-2 (+4.3); etc. Leptin mRNA was also significantly increased (+10) as well as the long-form of its receptor ObR-b (+9). Conversely, when wounds were exposed to anti-leptin antibodies, healing progression was impaired and changes in the transcriptional profile showed diminished expression of several genes related to wound neovascularization. Some examples by 24 hours: Endoglin(?2.5); Flk-1(?2.8); eNOS (?5.1); Ang-2 (?5.1); CD31(?3); VEGF-A (?3.6). In conclusion, leptin had and early and significant effect in modulating wound neovascularization. The effect of treatment of wounds with exogenous leptin did not elicit hypervascularization of the wound and appeared to only accelerate what appeared to be a self-limited process of wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: One of the earliest events in wound healing and scar formation is the inflammatory phase. Deficient or excessive inflammatory responses result in aberrant healing. NFK-b is a transcription factor that regulates key genes responsible for multiple intra-nuclear inflammatory cytokines. When bound to IK-B, an inhibitory protein, this factor is in an inactive state. We studied the wound healing effects of irreversibly inhibiting the activation of NFK-b by continuously infusing adenoviral activated IK-B. Methods: Seventy-five male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponge-osmotic pump constructs. The pumps were filled with a solution containing a genetically altered adenovirus containing the DNA for continuously activated IK-B protein. 50??l of viral transport media containing 5???109 PFU of virus were delivered to each individual sponges daily. Controls included pumps filled with normal saline in one group or filled with sham virus in another group. Sponges were harvested on days 1,3,5, and 7 post-implantation. The sponges were analyzed for TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as index of inflammation, as well as for hydroxyproline (OHP) content at seven days, an index of collagen deposition. Results: Treatment with the IK-B virus resulted in significantly higher levels of OHP after seven days when compared to normal saline and sham virus treated sponges (654?±?81 vs 546?±?109 vs 498?±?123??g OHP/100?mg sponge, P?<?0.05 by ANOVA). Wound fluid NO concentration was significantly lower in the IkB group after 5 days (38?±?15 vs 55?±?12 vs 71?±?27??M, P?<?0.05 by chi-square). There were no differences in sponge TNF-α concentrations on days 1,3, and 5. Conclusions: Treatment of wound sponge granulomas with IK-B increases the amount of collagen deposition after seven days. Reduction of inflammation by inhibiting NF-KB may be a possible mechanism of action, as reflected in decreased NO wound content.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Background: The study of wound biology and effects of advanced modalities would benefit from a reliable human model for normal healing. Eaglstein et?al. previously suggested that the forearm biopsy may be useful in acute wound healing studies (J Am Acad Dermatol 45:857, 2001). The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) here validates this model in healthy individuals treated with topical growth factor therapy. Methods: In our randomized, double-blinded study design, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel (Q.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.O.D.), iii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). The wounds were examined, measured and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events were monitored. Rates of healing and time-to-complete closure were measured. Repeat biopsies of a subset of healing wounds were performed for gene microarray analysis. Results: The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of acute wound healing outcomes achieved by rhPDGF-BB regimens versus standard care alone. There were no infectious complications. Subject compliance was excellent with?<?3% of visits missed. Conclusion: The forearm biopsy model has several advantages in the study of acute wounds: it allows for comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion; studies can be conducted easily with good patient compliance; and the forearm allows for repeat imaging and tissue harvesting for gene profiling during healing.

AB  - The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in wound healing is well established. These interactions likely involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-ß family. TGF-ß1, ß2 and ß3 isoforms signal by sequentially binding to the TGF-ß type II and type I receptors, respectively. We address the role of TGF-ß signaling in dermal fibroblasts using a conditional fibroblastic TGF-ß type II receptor knockout mouse model (termed FßKO). We found that the loss of TGF-ß signaling in the dermal fibroblasts results in accelerated excision-wound closure compared with similar wounds in wild type mice. The mechanism of the altered rate of re-epitheliaization in the FßKO mice was examined with regard to keratiocyte motility and proliferation. The migration of keratinocytes through collagen I coated 8??m pore filters in the presence or absence of fibroblast-conditioned media was tested. These experiments showed increased keratinocyte migration when incubated with FßKO dermal fibroblast conditioned media compared to media conditioned in wild type fibroblasts. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded intact skin indicated both wild type and FßKO mice had similar low levels of keratinocyte proliferation, based on Ki67 staining. In healing wounds, only the distal wound edges of wild type mice were proliferative. In contrast, the FßKO mice exhibited elevated proliferation across the length of the wound, including the leading edge of epithelial closure. Together our results suggest TGF-ß signaling by the dermal fibroblasts suppresses re-epithelialization of excision wounds by regulating keratinocyte motility and proliferation through paracrine mechanisms. ?
