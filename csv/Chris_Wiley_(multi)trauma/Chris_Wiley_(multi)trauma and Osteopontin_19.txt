AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - Bone marrow is an important supply for many progenitor cells, among them endothelial precursor cells. They have been already considered as potential therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic hindlimb. In this work we performed an unilateral chronic ischemic hindlimb model in 20 dogs, we were dissected and ligated the middle sacra artery and external right iliac artery preserving the internal iliac artery, after one week we removed de femoral artery performing a proximal and distal ligation and inserted into the gracilis muscle 3 Silastic tubes (0.8?mm diameter) in a middle circle form in order to created fibrocollagenous tunnels. Fifteen days later, we obtained bone marrow (30?mL) and mononuclear cells were separated; at the same time, all tubes were removed and bone marrow cells were transplanted into the fibrocollagenous tunnels, only in the third and fourth groups. During the 8 at 12 days we administered subcutaneously saline solution to the first and third groups and G-CSF to the second and fourth groups. Finally, after 30 days we performed contrasted angiographies from both limbs and was calculated mean angiographic score (MAS) from the number of vascular intersections, also was taken a biopsy from the central portion of right gracilis muscle for vascular assessment, as well as for vascular proliferating cells by immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated that white bone marrow cell transplantation enrichment by G-CSF administration stimulates angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb, twice than controls, and it is better than white bone marrow cell transplantation alone. White bone marrow cell is a potential therapy for ischemic hindlimb, because stem cells are growth factor provider, as well as an important source for endothelial precursors capable to form vessels de novo, mainly when this stem cells are deposited in an appropriate extracellular matrix, such as the fibrocollagenous tunnels in this model.

AB  - The inability to experiment in humans creates a great need to develop culture systems that mimic human tissues/organs. Skin is arguably the simplest human tissue and therefore provides an excellent prototype for tissue engineering. Moreover, skin is the body?s first line of defense. Currently available skin replacements have been classified into four categories: (i) those that are composed completely of epidermal cells; (ii) those consisting of dermal components derived from processing of cadaver skin or from collagen and other matrix molecules; (iii) those containing both dermal and epidermal components and (iv) those that contain dermal, epidermal and vascular components. All of these substitutes have drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need for skin replacements that: (a) are prepared with pertinent primary human cells but yet can be ready ?off? the shelf; (b) can be prepared rapidly; (c) contain stable structures in particular microvessels that can rapidly connect with the patient?s vasculature in this manner establish circulation in the ?graft? increasing the chances of survival; (d) can be tailored for specific wound impairments (e) are long lasting. We have developed a new generation human ?skin? that can fulfil these requirements and can potentially be used as a ?living bandage?. We start with three primary human cell types and a collagen matrix that self-assemble into a connective tissue containing a network of mature microvessels, is covered with a stratified epidermis, expresses biochemical markers, matrix molecules, and cytokines characteristic of normal human skin and matures in 10?15 days. Moreover, two additional cell types, pericytes and monocytes, differentiate in situ adjacent to and within microvessels, respectively providing stability to the micriovessels and the epidermis expresses keratins that are typical of mature skin and not those characteristically produced in response to injury such as keratins 6, 16, 17. This tissue can potentially be developed into a skin replacement for patients with impaired healing. In addition, this tissue responds normally to bological stimuli, providing a powerful vehicle to investigate mechanisms of skin development and regeneration, understand pathological processes, and test drugs and treatments for skin diseases

AB  - A porcine model of second-degree burn wound was used to evaluate the effect of a newly developed topical oxygen emulsion (TOE) on collagen deposition during wound repair. A total of 6 pigs were used for the study. The burn wounds were treated with air exposure (no treatment), vehicle control or TOE, which contains super-saturated oxygen and releases oxygen in sustained high level when applied topically. Skin wound samples were collected at days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 after wounding. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) were used to examine the mRNA expressions for type I and type III collagens and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1). RT-PCR products were run on ethidium bromide gel and analyzed under UV light with Bio-Rad Gel Document 2000 system. The expression intensity was recorded as the mean gray value. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The results showed: 1). Higher mRNA expressions of collagen III and MMP-1 were observed in TOE treatment group compared with air exposure and vehicle control groups. 2). MMP-1 expression increased shortly after wounding with peak at days 4 and 7. 3). Collagen III expression increased earlier with peak at day 10 and day 14. 4). Collagen I expression level increased later than that of collagen III. Significant increase was seen after day 10 with the highest at day 21. However, there was no significant difference between vehicle control and TOE treatment groups. The data suggests that sustained high level of oxygen release by TOE may promote wound repair through the mechanism of increased expressions of type I and type III collagens. The TOE also increased the expression of MMP-1, which might accelerate clearing damaged collagens in the earlier phase of wound healing and promote collagen remodeling in the later phase. This study was supported by grants from DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Bacteria reside in various forms, including planktonic, or free-floating, or as biofilms, which are a tightly adherent, potentially more treatment-resistant form. Biofilms, composed in part as polysaccharide matrices, can act as protection for bacteria by shielding them from antimicrobials and the innate immune system. It is estimated that bacterial biofilm are responsible for 65?80% of all chronic infections and may be responsible in part for non-healing of chronic wounds. An advance in the treatment of non-healing wounds has lead to the development of human skin equivalents (HSE), which can successfully treat many non-healing wounds. Better understanding the interaction between bacteria and HSE might improve patient outcomes. Studies involving planktonic E. coli and HSE have demonstrated the growth of bacterial colonies only on the dermal surface. Growth was not seen on the epidermal layer of the HSE, possibly due in part to the expression of innate antimicrobial peptides called human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2), which are expressed by HSE keratinocytes. The objective of this study was to determine if biofilm formation could occur on a bioengineered HSE. We used a commercially available HSE. Three (3) mm full-thickness incisions were made in a triangular section of HSE. Each section was inoculated on the epidermal aspect with 1.0???105CFU per gram of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 35 degrees Celsius for specified time points. Sections of HSE were sampled in areas of injury at various time points. Biopsy sections were processed for histologic analysis with H&E and epifluorescent microscopy to visualize Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that biofilm formation occurred at multiple time points on HSE. Colonies of adherent bacteria were visualized within the injured area of the epidermal layer of HSE by H & E staining. Eplifluoresecnt microscopy using calcofluor white staining revealed the characteristic exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix of biofilm. Visualization of the expression of human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2) with HSE after biofilm formation is underway. This knowledge will help to understand the role of bacterial biofilms within HSE and their effect on subsequent healing.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of skin graft fixation with fibrin sealant (FS) alone by means of spray application with a low setting time (thrombin concentration 4?5?IU/ml) in comparison to point suture fixation as a clinical reference method. Furthermore, the influence of two different quantities of FS were tested. ?Material and Methods: On the dorsum of 6 male pigs four full-thickness wounds (8???4?cm) were excised in each animal. Randomly the four defects were divided into 3 groups (FS 0.05?ml/cm2; FS 0.15?ml/cm2(Tisseel, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria); Suture) and covered with autologous split thickness skin grafts. Outcome measurements included hematoma/seroma formation, graft dislocation, wound contraction, graft take rate and healed wound area. Observational time points were the 5th, 14th and 21st postoperative day.?Results: Hematoma formation on day of surgery was more pronounced in the suture group (FS 0.05?ml/cm2 vs. suture, p?<?0.05), similar the situation on the 5th postoperative day but without statistical significance. Graft dislocation revealed marked but not significant extended area in the suture group vs. the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group. The FS 0.05?ml/cm2 graft take on day 5 was found to be enhanced in comparison to the suture group. Excellent wound healing was notable on final observation day in the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group with a healed wound area of 99.7 (3.6/0.3). Corresponding values in the FS 0.15?ml/cm2 was 96.9 (4.7/2.1) and 95.9 (2.7/2.1) for the suture group. Values represents median (Q1/Q3). ?Conclusion: The application of a thin layer of FS (0.05?ml/cm2) in a low setting rate (4?5?IU thrombin) in split thickness skin transplantation via a spray device shows comparable results to those yielded with suture point fixation (surrogate for staples). Advantages are e.g. better cosmetic results and initial hemostasis with minimizing the incidence of early hematoma formation. Equal properties of manufactured low thrombin (4?IU; Canada) preparation vs. 500?IU (US) diluted to a 5?IU thrombin solution was also demonstrated.

AB  - Introduction: Adenoviral gene transfer of Angiopoietin-1 (AdAng1) recruits endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and improves diabetic wound healing. A suggested mechanism for EPC mobilization from the bone marrow (BM) is mediated through MMP-9 and stem cell factor (SCF). We hypothesize that Ang-1 recruits EPCs to diabetic wounds via an MMP-9 dependent mechanism. ?Methods: Lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with BM from transgenic TIE-2/LacZ mice. After engraftment, diabetes was induced with steptozotocin. 8?mm wounds were created in BM transplanted (BMT)(n?=?12) or MMP-9 knockout (KO)(n?=?12) mice and treated with 1???108 PFU of AdAng1, AdGFP or PBS. At 7 days wounds were analyzed for epithelial gap, vessel density, and EPCs. Serum levels of VEGF, proMMP9 and SCF were assessed. Data are expressed as mean?±?SEM ?Results: In diabetic BMT wounds, AdAng1 results in improved reepithelialization (Ang1 2.3?±?.2?mm; GFP 3.9?±?.2; PBS 4.0?±?.1 p?<?.0001) neovascularization (Ang1 6.8?±?.3Caps/Hpf; GFP 3.0?±?.4; PBS 2.9?±?.3 p?<?.0001) and EPC recruitment (Ang1 5.3?±?.4 EPCs/Hpf; GFP 2.1?±?.3; PBS 2.2?±?.3 p?<?.0001). AdAng1 treatment results in increased levels of proMMP-9 (Ang1 9.7?±?.8?ng/ml; GFP 6.3?±?.9; PBS 6.4?±?.4 p?<?.01) and SCF (Ang1 265?±?28?pg/ml; GFP 119?±?16; PBS159?±?12 p?<?.001). In MMP9 KO mice, AdAng1 accelerates reepithelialization (Ang1 3.2?±?.1?mm; GFP 4.1?±?.2; PBS 3.8?±?.2; p<.) but has no significant effect on neovascularization (Ang1 4.1?±?.5 Caps/HPF; GFP 3.9?±?.4; PBS 3.9?±?.6), EPC recruitment (Ang1 2?±?.3 EPC/Hpf; GFP 1.5?±?.3; PBS 1.6?±?.2) or SCF levels (Ang1 83?±?5?pg/ml; GFP 83?±?2; PBS 88?±?6). ?Conclusions: The effects of Ang-1 on EPC recruitment and neovascularization are dependent on MMP-9. Our data support the hypothesis that MMP-9 enables SCF to permit mobilization of EPCs.

AB  - At Ophidia Products, Inc. we have discovered Oxynor a synthetic therapeutic from snake venom for wound healing. The venom of Australian taipan snake (Oxyuranus s. scutellatus) is extremely potent due to the presence of taipoxin. The intact complex molecule of taipoxin having molecular weight 45.6?kDa is composed of three subunits α, ? and ?. Fractionation of crude venom by High pressure chromatography (HPLC) using ion exchange column permits separation of the subunits. The mitogenic activity was revealed in non toxic ? taipoxin. Non toxic ? taipoxin showed mitogenic activity on variety of eukaryotic cells. Its activity as a mitogen extended to wound healing in experimental animals. We identified the active domain for wound healing in ? taipoxin. after trypsin digestion were separated on HPLC, resolved into 11 different fragments. Each fragment was tested on PC12 cells to test mitogenic/neurotrophic activity. The fragment which showed the highest activity consisted of 21 amino acids. A synthetic peptide consisting of ten amino acids, from the N-terminal ?? was named Oxynor. Oxynor mimics the biological properties of natural ? taipoxin when tested in vitro and in vivo systems. The biological results showed that Oxynor was not toxic at the concentration of 100??g/ml for PC12 cells and 500??g/adult mouse. Oxynor was mitogenic to various eukaryotic cells. Oxynor is neurotrophic showing neurite outgrowth on PC12 cells. Growth of human skin fibroblast cells indicates that Oxynor has keratinous activity. Experimentally produced 4?mm punched wounds on the back of mice were treated with ? taipoxin 100??g/mouse or Oxynor at 500??g/mouse for seven consecutive days. The results showed complete closure of the wounds after six days while the wounds of control treated with PBS were open. Histology examination of the skin around the wounds revealed that treated mice showed re-epithelization of the epidermis, which looked close to the normal mouse skin biopsy. Whereas the controls showed distortion of epithelium. ? taipoxin and Oxynor were tested for in vivo at the concentration of 100??g/ml in hydrogel vehicle applied once daily to help heal 6?mm ischemic skin wounds in rats. At days 7 and 14 wound treated with ? taipoxin were about 15% smaller than the wounds treated with Oxynor. This shows that synthetic Oxynor is as efficacious as natural ? taipoxin under the conditions of the test. On increasing the concentration of Oxynor to 500??g/ml should give equivalent wound closure to 100??g/ml of ? taipoxin. In 1997 the US FDA approved for sale the first recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) for treatment of human non-healing wounds. Oxynor will be next therapeutic for wound healing Currently, Oxynor is in clinical trials, it has passed toxicity tests.

AB  - Fibroblast migration from the peri-wound collagenous stroma into the fibrin-laden wound is critical for granulation tissue formation and subsequent healing. Previously we found that fibroblast transmigration from a collagen matrix into a fibrin matrix required the presence of fibronectin (FN). Several cell surface receptors, namely integrins α4?1, α5?1 and αv?3 were also required for this invasive migration. Here we demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, known to bind FN at the highly cationic HepII domain is also required for fibroblast invasive migration of a fibrin/FN gel. This conclusion was based on fibroblast migration using two independent means of disrupting syndecan-4: heparinase degradation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans or suppression of syndecan-4 core protein with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Isolated syndecan-4 from these fibroblasts bound the Hep II recombinant constructs FN III12?15v?>?FN III12?15?>?FN III12?14 but did not bind the alternatively spliced IIICs (V) domain. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is required to stimulate fibroblast migration, markedly increased cell levels of syndecan-4 core protein in a time and dose dependent fashion. PDGF also induced up-regulation of syndecan-4 at transcriptional level as determined by RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that syndecan-4 is essential for fibroblast invasive migration into fibrin clot and that PDGF, the stimulus for migration, induces increased syndecan-4 core protein expression.

AB  - Introduction: Venous ulcers are the most common chronic wounds of the lower limbs. In our laboratory, the self-assembly method is used to reconstruct autologous skin that can be used as a biological dressing (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318; J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). Goals and Methods: The aim of this study was to establish if our self-assembled skin substitute (SASS) allows the closure of nonhealing venous leg ulcers. A case study of a 68-year-old woman with a chronic venous leg ulcer present for over one year and measuring 135?cm2 is thus herein presented. The autologous cells were isolated from a cutaneous biopsy (1?cm2) and cultivated in vitro(J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). The autologous SASS was produced and assembled by the cells thus it does not contain any exogenous or synthetic material (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318). The wound was debrided, covered with grafts of SASS and maintained in place with a compressive dressing (Coban, 3M, St-Paul, MN). A new SASS was applied weekly until wound closure. The SASS seemed to lessen the pain caused by the ulcer. Seven applications of the SASS were necessary to lead to a full wound closure. Conclusion: Venous leg ulcer quickly reepithelialized after application of our SASS This case indicates that use of the SASS can reduce pain and promote closure of nonhealing leg ulcers Furthermore, we thus hope that our SASS biological dressing maybe clinically useful to treat difficult-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was approved by the Health Canada?s Therapeutic Products Directorate and by the Ethic Committee of the CHAUQ, Saint-Sacrement Hospital.

AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine constitutively expressed in adipose tissue and upregulated by hypoxia in sites of tissue injury and in the placenta. Leptin has been demonstrated to play a role in normal and pathological wound healing and it is gene is acutely expressed in experimental wounds. Angiogenesis is among the most salient and well-documented biological actions of leptin. Therefore it was hypothesized that leptin may play in the modulation of wound neovascularization. Using a murine model of experimental wounds the modulation of wound angiogenesis was investigated by treatment of the wounds to either recombinant leptin or a neutralizing anti-leptin antibody. The parameters measured were: a)woundblood flow using laser Doppler imaging; b)vesseldensity by counting the number of CD-31 positive vessels in wound sections; c)angiogenic transcriptionalprofiling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR; and d)validation of transcriptionalprofiling by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The treatment of wounds with leptin had a marked effect in wound blood flow that was most significant at 24hours post-wounding with average increase of 55% with respect to the controls. The effect diminished significantly by 72 hours (24%) and became negligible thereafter. Leptin also accelerate wound neovascularization by 24 hours where the number of small caliber vessels averaged 30/mm2 in leptin treated vessels and 13/mm2 in the controls (n?=?10; P?<?0.005). However, the number of vessels measured by 72 hours not significantly different between controls and leptin-treated wounds. In addition transcriptional profiling reveled changes in gene expression of molecules related to angiogenesis such as VEGF, PlGF, Tie-1, Tie-2, Flt-1, Flk-1, FGF-2 and endothelial markers like CD-31, endoglin and eNOS. Overall, time course analysis throughout the healing process showed that leptin treatment induced an early shift in the expression of many of the analyzed transcripts. The most salient changes could be observed as early as 6 hours post-wounding and included: TSP-1 (+8.7); FLK-1(+9); Ang-2 (+18); CD31(+5.3); endoglin (+7.6); eNOS (+4.2); FGF-2 (+4.3); etc. Leptin mRNA was also significantly increased (+10) as well as the long-form of its receptor ObR-b (+9). Conversely, when wounds were exposed to anti-leptin antibodies, healing progression was impaired and changes in the transcriptional profile showed diminished expression of several genes related to wound neovascularization. Some examples by 24 hours: Endoglin(?2.5); Flk-1(?2.8); eNOS (?5.1); Ang-2 (?5.1); CD31(?3); VEGF-A (?3.6). In conclusion, leptin had and early and significant effect in modulating wound neovascularization. The effect of treatment of wounds with exogenous leptin did not elicit hypervascularization of the wound and appeared to only accelerate what appeared to be a self-limited process of wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Introduction: One of the earliest events in wound healing and scar formation is the inflammatory phase. Deficient or excessive inflammatory responses result in aberrant healing. NFK-b is a transcription factor that regulates key genes responsible for multiple intra-nuclear inflammatory cytokines. When bound to IK-B, an inhibitory protein, this factor is in an inactive state. We studied the wound healing effects of irreversibly inhibiting the activation of NFK-b by continuously infusing adenoviral activated IK-B. Methods: Seventy-five male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponge-osmotic pump constructs. The pumps were filled with a solution containing a genetically altered adenovirus containing the DNA for continuously activated IK-B protein. 50??l of viral transport media containing 5???109 PFU of virus were delivered to each individual sponges daily. Controls included pumps filled with normal saline in one group or filled with sham virus in another group. Sponges were harvested on days 1,3,5, and 7 post-implantation. The sponges were analyzed for TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as index of inflammation, as well as for hydroxyproline (OHP) content at seven days, an index of collagen deposition. Results: Treatment with the IK-B virus resulted in significantly higher levels of OHP after seven days when compared to normal saline and sham virus treated sponges (654?±?81 vs 546?±?109 vs 498?±?123??g OHP/100?mg sponge, P?<?0.05 by ANOVA). Wound fluid NO concentration was significantly lower in the IkB group after 5 days (38?±?15 vs 55?±?12 vs 71?±?27??M, P?<?0.05 by chi-square). There were no differences in sponge TNF-α concentrations on days 1,3, and 5. Conclusions: Treatment of wound sponge granulomas with IK-B increases the amount of collagen deposition after seven days. Reduction of inflammation by inhibiting NF-KB may be a possible mechanism of action, as reflected in decreased NO wound content.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Background: The study of wound biology and effects of advanced modalities would benefit from a reliable human model for normal healing. Eaglstein et?al. previously suggested that the forearm biopsy may be useful in acute wound healing studies (J Am Acad Dermatol 45:857, 2001). The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) here validates this model in healthy individuals treated with topical growth factor therapy. Methods: In our randomized, double-blinded study design, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel (Q.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.O.D.), iii) rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). The wounds were examined, measured and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events were monitored. Rates of healing and time-to-complete closure were measured. Repeat biopsies of a subset of healing wounds were performed for gene microarray analysis. Results: The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of acute wound healing outcomes achieved by rhPDGF-BB regimens versus standard care alone. There were no infectious complications. Subject compliance was excellent with?<?3% of visits missed. Conclusion: The forearm biopsy model has several advantages in the study of acute wounds: it allows for comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion; studies can be conducted easily with good patient compliance; and the forearm allows for repeat imaging and tissue harvesting for gene profiling during healing.

AB  - The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in wound healing is well established. These interactions likely involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-ß family. TGF-ß1, ß2 and ß3 isoforms signal by sequentially binding to the TGF-ß type II and type I receptors, respectively. We address the role of TGF-ß signaling in dermal fibroblasts using a conditional fibroblastic TGF-ß type II receptor knockout mouse model (termed FßKO). We found that the loss of TGF-ß signaling in the dermal fibroblasts results in accelerated excision-wound closure compared with similar wounds in wild type mice. The mechanism of the altered rate of re-epitheliaization in the FßKO mice was examined with regard to keratiocyte motility and proliferation. The migration of keratinocytes through collagen I coated 8??m pore filters in the presence or absence of fibroblast-conditioned media was tested. These experiments showed increased keratinocyte migration when incubated with FßKO dermal fibroblast conditioned media compared to media conditioned in wild type fibroblasts. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded intact skin indicated both wild type and FßKO mice had similar low levels of keratinocyte proliferation, based on Ki67 staining. In healing wounds, only the distal wound edges of wild type mice were proliferative. In contrast, the FßKO mice exhibited elevated proliferation across the length of the wound, including the leading edge of epithelial closure. Together our results suggest TGF-ß signaling by the dermal fibroblasts suppresses re-epithelialization of excision wounds by regulating keratinocyte motility and proliferation through paracrine mechanisms. ?

AB  - Aim : An antimicrobial dressing that combines high absorbency and potent antimicrobial properties. The unique composition of the dressing manages exudates in moderate to heavily exuding, infected or critically colonised wounds, which creates a favourable environment for effective wound management. Methods : Two test methods were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the dressing: 1) A zone of inhibition sensitivity test that challenges the dressing to a seeded agar plate and 2) A log reduction test that exposes a small sample of dressing against a high bacterial loaded broth, measuring the log reduction of the bacteria over a specified time period. The absorbency of the dressing was evaluated using British Pharmacopoeia test methods. Results : The antimicrobial dressing has been shown to be highly effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans and also against resistant organisms MRSE, MRSA and VRE. The product is highly absorbent with absorbency?>?16?g/g and 16?g/m2.
