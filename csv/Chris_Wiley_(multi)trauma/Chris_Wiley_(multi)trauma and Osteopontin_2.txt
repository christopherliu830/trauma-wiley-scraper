AB  - Abstract Surface modification is one important way to fabricate successful biocompatible materials in bone tissue engineering. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) materials have received considerable attention as suitable bioceramics for manufacturing osseous implants because of their similarity to bone mineral in terms of chemical composition. In this study, the surface of porous HAp scaffold was modified by collagen treatment and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) conjugation. The surface modification did not affect the HAp scaffold's bulk properties. No significant difference in compressive strength was found among different scaffolds, with HAp, collagen modified HAp, and collagen?BMP-2-functionalized HAp having compressive strengths of 45.8?±?3.12, 51.2?±?4.09, and 50.7?±?3.98?MPa, respectively. In vitro studies were performed to compare adhesion and osteogenic differentiation between human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) with modified surfaces and those unmodified HAp surfaces. Collagen or BMP-2 alone was insufficient and that both collagen and BMP-2 are necessary to get the desired results. The findings suggest the possibility of using three-dimensional HAp scaffold treated with gold-standard collagen coating and highly researched BMP-2 growth factor as a platform to deliver hADSCs. Results of this study could be used to develop treatment strategy for regenerating completely transected models using more synergistic approaches.

AB  - Abstract Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multi-functional growth factors belonging to the transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) superfamily. BMPs are expressed in a large variety of tissues and organs, where they exhibit pleiotropic functions during development as well as in the adult organism. Thus maintenance of the BMP signaling pathways requires strict control and regulation by antagonists, co-receptors and inhibitors. BMPs exert their signals by binding to hetero-oligomeric signaling complexes composed of type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity. They play a decisive role in the development of several diseases but are also involved in self-renewal of stem cells and tissue regeneration. These insights may lead to the design of future therapeutic treatments. This review focuses on the differential BMP signaling pathways initiated at distinct oligomerized signaling complexes as well as on the pathological aspects of BMP signaling in diseases and their potential for tissue regeneration.

AB  - Periodontitis is a multi-factorial disease and in most cases also a disease with a chronic progression. Exposure to factors which contribute to periodontitis occurs over a long period, so that at the time of diagnosis it may be difficult to identify and evaluate what co-factors have contributed to its development. These include exposure to bacteria and viruses, inflammation, genetic factors, health behaviours and a variety of social factors, socio-economic status, behavioural and nutritional habits, the ability to cope with stress and the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Many patients in their 50s also experience other conditions such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or rheumatoid arthritis and recent reports on the associations and potential biological mechanisms by which periodontitis can be linked to other systemic diseases suggest that the patient with periodontitis is a challenged individual. Neither individuals nor their oral health care providers are currently prepared for the challenges in oral health care as the expectation of successful ageing with remaining and aesthetically functional teeth is increasing. The scientific evidence is, however, growing, and while the opportunities to prepare for successful ageing exist they must be included in the educational process of both current and future oral health care providers and their patients.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Abstract Successful bone regeneration benefits from three-dimensional (3D) bioresorbable scaffolds that mimic the hierarchical architecture and mechanical characteristics of native tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). A scaffold platform that integrates unique material chemistry with nanotopography while mimicking the 3D hierarchical bone architecture and bone mechanics is reported. A biocompatible dipeptide polyphosphazene-polyester blend is electrospun to produce fibers in the diameter range of 50?500 nm to emulate dimensions of collagen fibrils present in the natural bone ECM. Various electrospinning and process parameters are optimized to produce blend nanofibers with good uniformity, appropriate mechanical strength, and suitable porosity. Biomimetic 3D scaffolds are created by orienting blend nanofiber matrices in a concentric manner with an open central cavity to replicate bone marrow cavity, as well as the lamellar structure of bone. This biomimicry results in scaffold stress?strain curve similar to that of native bone with a compressive modulus in the mid-range of values for human trabecular bone. Blend nanofiber matrices support adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts and show an elevated phenotype expression compared to polyester nanofibers. Furthermore, the 3D structure encourages osteoblast infiltration and ECM secretion, bridging the gaps of scaffold concentric walls during in vitro culture. The results also highlight the importance of in situ ECM secretion by cells in maintaining scaffold mechanical properties following scaffold degradation with time. This study for the first time demonstrates the feasibility of developing a mechanically competent nanofiber matrix via a biomimetic strategy and the advantages of polyphosphazene blends in promoting osteoblast phenotype progression for bone regeneration.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive source for regenerative medicine. However, prior to their application, fundamental questions regarding molecular characterisation, growth and differentiation of MSCs must be resolved. Objectives: To compare and better understand the behaviour of equine MSCs obtained from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT) in culture. Methods: Five horses were included in this study. Proliferation rate was measured using MTT assay and cell viability; apoptosis, necrosis and late apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of 7 surface marker genes were quantified using RT-qPCR and CD90 was also analysed by flow cytometry. Differentiation was evaluated using specific staining, measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and analysis of the mRNA expression. Results: High interindividual differences were observed in proliferation in both cell types, particularly during the final days. Statistically significant differences in viability and early apoptosis of cultured AT- and BM-MSCs were found. The highest values of early apoptosis were observed during the first days of culture, while the highest percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis and lowest viability was observed in the last days. Surface marker expression pattern observed is in accordance to other studies in horse and other species. Osteogenic differentiation was evident after 7 days, with an increasing of ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers. Adipogenic differentiation was achieved in BM-MSCs from 2 donors with one of the 16 media tested. Chondrogenic differentiation was also observed. Conclusions: Proliferation ability is different in AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Differences in viability and early apoptosis were observed between both sources and CD34 was only found in AT-MSCs. Differences in their osteogenic and adipogenic potential were detected by staining and quantification of specific tissue markers. Potential relevance: To provide data to better understand AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs behaviour in vitro.

AB  - Abstract Clinical translation of cell-based strategies for tissue regeneration remains challenging because survival of implanted cells within hostile, hypoxic wound environments is uncertain. Overexpression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in implanted cells. The present study describes an ?off the shelf? prefabricated scaffold integrated with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) used to upregulate Bcl-2 expression in implanted adipose-derived stromal cells for bone regeneration. Iron oxide cores were sequentially coated with branched polyethyleneimine, minicircle plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein and Bcl-2, and poly-?-amino ester. Through in vitro assays, increased osteogenic potential and biological resilience were demonstrated in the magnetofected group over control and nucleofected groups. Similarly, our in vivo calvarial defect study showed that magnetofection had an efficiency rate of 30%, which in turn resulted in significantly more healing compared with control group and nucleofected group. Our novel, prefabricated MNP-integrated scaffold allows for in situ postimplant temporospatial control of cell transfection to augment bone regeneration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone defect and osteochondral injury frequently occur due to diseases or traumatism and bring a crucial challenge in orthopedics. The hybrid scaffold has shown promise as a potential strategy for the treatment of such defects. In this study, a novel biomimetic porous collagen (Col)/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold was fabricated through assembling layers of Col containing gradual amount of HA under the assistance of ?iterative layering? freeze-drying process. The scaffold presents a double gradient of highly interconnected porosity and HA content from top to bottom, mimicking the inherent physiological structure of bone. Owing to the biomimetic structure and component, significant increase of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro was observed, illustrating potential application of the excellent Col/HA scaffold as a promising strategy for bone tissue engineering. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Maxillofacial defects are complex lesions stemming from various etiologies: accidental, congenital, pathological, or surgical. A bone graft may be required when the normal regenerative capacity of the bone is exceeded or insufficient. Surgeons have many options available for bone grafting including the ?gold standard? autologous bone graft. However, this approach is not without drawbacks such as the morbidity associated with harvesting bone from a donor site, pain, infection, or a poor quantity and quality of bone in some patient populations. This review discusses the various bone graft substitutes used for maxillofacial and craniofacial repair: allografts, xenografts, synthetic biomaterials, and tissue-engineered substitutes. A brief overview of bone tissue engineering evolution including the use of mesenchymal stem cells is exposed, highlighting the first clinical applications of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells in craniofacial reconstruction. The importance of prevascularization strategies for bone tissue engineering is also discussed, with an emphasis on recent work describing substitutes produced using cell sheet-based technologies, including the use of thermo-responsive plates and the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering. Indeed, considering their entirely cell-based design, these natural bone-like substitutes have the potential to closely mimic the osteogenicity, osteoconductivity, osteoinduction, and osseointegration properties of autogenous bone for maxillofacial and craniofacial reconstruction.

AB  - Background It is now generally accepted that the response to a particular signal, such as the surgical trauma following implant placement, is not the result of a single linear signalling pathway, but rather reflects pathway integration, which can occur at multiple levels. Although it is well documented that both SLA and SLActive surfaces are able to promote bone formation and osseointegration, it is still unclear which are the key signalling pathways involved and how surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity might affect pathway integration. Objective To combine gene and protein data from in vivo studies applying titanium hydrophobic (Sandblasting, Large-grit, Acid-etching, SLA) and hydrophilic (SLActive) surfaces to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pro-osteogenic properties of these surfaces. Methods The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG?) pathway database and the Ingenuity? Pathway Analysis (IPA?) software were applied to the genomic and proteomic data of previous in vivo studies applying SLA and SLActive surfaces, with the specific aim to focus on bone formation-related signalling pathways. While gene data were derived from a human study on osseointegration, protein data originated from a preclinical study in rabbits. Data were available for the 4, 7 and 14 days of healing periods. Results Both genomic and proteomic data showed that the osteogenesis process takes place mainly at 7 and 14 days of healing on both SLA and SLActive surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity enhances bone formation at multiple levels, by directly promoting an earlier expression of pathways involved in cell proliferation and osteoblast precursor differentiation (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT, Wnt, Notch, transforming growth factor-?), but also by positively regulating angiogenesis, bone mineralization and bone remodelling. Conclusion This study combined, for the first time, different ?omics? outputs to get new insights on the molecular mechanisms behind the influence of surface hydrophilicity on osseointegration/bone formation. Specific signalling pathways, such as Wnt, vascular endothelial growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were identified as differentially modulated by titanium surface hydrophilicity both at a genomic and proteomic level. These findings may be used in the future to monitor/predict the bone formation/osseointegration process, or as a screening tool towards the manufacture of new pro-osteogenic implant surfaces. In order to take into account the full complexity and interplay of cell signalling during bone formation, powerful bioinformatics tools integrating different ?omics? data and predicting signalling pathways trends should be applied by future studies.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.

AB  - Background In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), current oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitors do not provide maximal platelet inhibition at the time of reperfusion. Furthermore, administration of cangrelor prior to reperfusion has been shown in pre-clinical studies to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size. Therefore, we hypothesize that cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion in STEMI patients will reduce the incidence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and limit MI size in STEMI patients treated with PPCI. Methods The platelet inhibition to target reperfusion injury (PITRI) trial, is a phase 2A, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, in which 210 STEMI patients will be randomized to receive either an intravenous (IV) bolus of cangrelor (30 ?g/kg) followed by a 120-minute infusion (4 ?g/kg/min) or matching saline placebo, initiated prior to reperfusion (NCT03102723). Results The study started in October 2017 and the anticipated end date would be July 2020. The primary end-point will be MI size quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) on day 3 post-PPCI. Secondary endpoints will include markers of reperfusion, incidence of MVO, MI size, and adverse left ventricular remodeling at 6 months, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Summary The aim of the PITRI trial is to assess whether cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion would reduce acute MI size and MVO, as assessed by CMR.

AB  - When the pulp of a tooth is irreversibly inflamed or necrotic and the apex is open, conventional root canal treatment is difficult to perform and the outcome is uncertain. Traditionally, the apexification procedure has consisted of multiple and long-term applications of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] to create an apical barrier to aid the obturation. Recently, artificial apical barriers such as those made with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) have been used in teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. More recently, procedures referred to as regenerative endodontics have received much attention as an option for these teeth. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature review from May 1952?May 2011 regarding the management of teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. This review covers the articles published in dental journals and book chapters regarding the definition, history, materials used, animal and human studies, mechanisms of action, prognosis, as well as advantages and disadvantages of apexification, apical plugs, and regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Abstract With an increase in the ageing population worldwide, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases at an alarming rate in both male and female irrespective of their ethnicity. At present, the currently available therapeutic options are mostly limited to either bone resorptive or bone forming efficacies and both approaches are associated with serious side effects. Despite these options, there is still need for newer therapeutics to treat osteoporosis, which can offer beneficial effects for maintaining balanced dynamics between bone formation and bone resorption, devoid of any side effect. The proper understanding of pathophysiology of the disease is essential for designing or investigating an effective and safe anti-osteoporotic agent. This review represents a discussion around the molecular targets with their implications in disease progression, available therapeutic options, the emerging targets, and the importance of designing an effective anti-osteoporotic agent.

AB  - Abstract Even mildly hypothermic body or limb temperatures can retard healing processes in mammals. Despite this, we observed that hibernating American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) elicit profound abilities in mounting inflammatory responses to infection and/or foreign bodies. In addition, they resolve injuries during hibernation while maintaining mildly hypothermic states (30?35 °C) and without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. We describe experimental studies on free-ranging bears that document their abilities to completely resolve cutaneous cuts and punctures incurred during or prior to hibernation. We induced small, full-thickness cutaneous wounds (biopsies or incisions) during early denning, and re-biopsied sites 2?3 months later (near the end of denning). Routine histological methods were used to characterize these skin samples. All biopsied sites with respect to secondary intention (open circular biopsies) and primary intention (sutured sites) healed, with evidence of initial eschar (scab) formation, completeness of healed epidermis and dermal layers, dyskeratosis (inclusion cysts), and abilities to produce hair follicles. These healing abilities of hibernating black bears are a clear survival advantage to animals injured before or during denning. Bears are known to have elevated levels of hibernation induction trigger (delta-opioid receptor agonist) and ursodeoxycholic acid (major bile acid within plasma, mostly conjugated with taurine) during hibernation, which may relate to these wound-healing abilities. Further research as to the underlying mechanisms of wound healing during hibernation could have applications in human medicine. Unique approaches may be found to improve healing for malnourished, hypothermic, diabetic and elderly patients or to reduce scarring associated with burns and traumatic injuries.
