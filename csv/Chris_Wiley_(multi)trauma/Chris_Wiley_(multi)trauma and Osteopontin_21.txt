AB  - Abstract In order to optimize and modulate bone formation it is essential to understand the expression patterns of key bone-specific growth factors, as osteoprogenitor cells undergo the processes of proliferation, differentiation and maturation. This study reports the sequential expression of bone-related growth and transcription factors when bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitor cells from C57BL mice were cultured on allograft bone discs. Mineralization and osteocalcin protein levels were used to track osteogenic differentiation and maturation. Bone-related growth factors, such as Bmp-2, Bmp-7, Ctnnb-1, Fgf-2, Igf-1, Vegf-a and Tgf-?1, and transcription factors, such as Runx-2 and osteocalcin, were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total density of mineralized bone was significantly increased 7.6 ± 0.7% in allografts cultured with cells, compared with a 0.5 ± 2.0% increase in the controls without cells (p < 0.01). Osteocalcin protein levels peaked at day 4. Protein expression showed peaks of BMP-2 and TGF-?1 on day 2, with VEGF peaking on day 8, and IGF-1 decreasing on day 2. mRNA for Pdgf-a peaked on day 2; Bmp-2 on days 4 and 16; Ctnnb-1 on days 8 and 20; Vegf-a, Fgf-2, Runx-2 and Igf-1 on day 12; Tgf-?1 on day 16; and Pdgf-b on day 20. Osteogenic growth factors correlated with Runx-2 and Ctnnb-1, whereas a predominant vascular growth factor, Vegf-a, did not follow this pattern. Specific bone-related genes and proteins were expressed in a time-dependent manner when osteoprogenitor cells were cultured on cortico-cancellous bone discs in vitro.

AB  - Abstract Bone is a highly organized structure comprising a calcified connective tissue matrix formed by mature osteoblasts, which develop from the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. The osteogenic cell lineage is thought to arise from a population of uncommitted multipotential stromal precursor cells (SPC) which reside close to all bone surfaces, in the bone marrow spaces and the surrounding connective tissue. These SPC also give rise to related cell lineages which form cartilage, smooth muscle, fat, and fibrous tissue. Due to the lack of well defined cell surface markers, little is known of the precise developmentally regulated changes in phenotype which occur during the differentiation and maturation of human osteoprogenitor cells into functional osteoblasts and ultimately, terminally differentiated osteocytes. In order to identify antibody reagents with greater specificity for osteoprogenitors we generated a series of antibodies following immunization with freshly isolated human bone marrow stromal fibroblasts. One such antibody, HOP-26, reacts with a cell surface antigen expressed by SPC and developing bone cells. We now demonstrate that this mAb identifies a member of the tetraspan family of cell surface glycoproteins, namely CD63. Western blot analysis of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) has revealed that like a well defined CD63 mAb 12F12, HOP-26 interacts with a heavily glycosylated cell surface protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50?60 kD.

AB  - Summary Although substance P (SP), a potent proinflammatory peptide, is involved in inflammation and immune responses, the effect of SP on the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 3α[MIP-3α, chemokine C-C ligand 20 (CCL20)] in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells is unknown. Equally enigmatic is the link between SP, the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and CCL20 production. We investigated whether SP induces the release of chemokine CCL20 from immortalized PDL (IPDL) cells, and further clarify SP-mediated pathways. We also examined the relationship between HO-1 and CCL20 by treating PDL cells with SP. Incubating IPDL cells with SP increased expression of CCL20 mRNA and CCL20 protein in a dose?time-dependent manner. Highly selective p38 and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors abrogated SP-induced expression of CCL20 in IPDL cells. SP is also responsible for initiating phosphorylation of I?B, degradation of I?B and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-?B. SP induced expression of HO-1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and CCL20 reflected similar patterns. The inductive effects of SP on HO-1 and CCL20 were enhanced by HO-1 inducer hemin and the membrane-permeable guanosine 3?,5?-monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8-bromo-cGMP. Conversely, this pathway was inhibited by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX) and the selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). We report herein the pathway that connects SP along with other modulators of neuroimmunoregulation to the induction of HO-1 and the inflammatory mediator macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α/CCL20 in IPDL cells, which play an important role in the development of periodontitis or inflammation during orthodontic tooth movement.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, haemophilia management has continually evolved, with prophylaxis now considered the treatment of choice. Prophylaxis primarily seeks to prevent bleeding and haemarthrosis episodes from occurring and avert the otherwise inevitable haemophilic arthropathy. Yet, numerous unanswered issues remain. These concern dose levels, dosing intervals, ways of integrating variability in bleeding phenotype, patient age, joint status, lifestyle, physical activity, treatment adherence and individual responses to FVIII or FIX concentrates. Individualized prophylaxis may thus be paramount. One crucial tool that may allow more accurate prophylaxis regimens to be implemented is the individual pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Therefore, physicians in charge of managing those living with haemophilia must be comfortable with PK profiling in order to be in a position to tailor patients? treatment, taking into account PK data, while minimizing patients? inconvenience, discomfort, as well as, possibly, treatment costs. For optimization of prophylaxis, recent development of recombinant molecules with more attractive PK properties, such as prolonged elimination half-life, increases the choice of dosing regimens, enabling decreased frequency of dosing for some, if deemed appropriate. For each patient, PK parameters can be determined, including trough levels, AUC, and time spent under a predefined threshold, with additional pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters possibly established by means of a global coagulation test like the thrombin generation test. Most importantly, target PK/PD parameters will need to consider clinical variables like patient age, body weight, joint status, treatment adherence, number of bleeding episodes, activity index or lifestyle.

AB  - Summary Tooth resorption is a common dental finding in cats and dogs. Its recognition and treatment are important to patient health. Tooth resorption is rarely diagnosed in cats and dogs younger than two years of age. Internal resorption is uncommon in dogs and cats. Treatment for internal resorption includes extraction or root canal therapy followed by restoration. Inflammatory external resorption begins in the perio-dontal ligament (PDL). Intraoral dental radiographic appearance of external tooth resorption varies from minute surface radiolucent defects of the tooth at the cementoenamel junction to widespread root replacement resorption, which gives the tooth a mottled or moth-eaten look. External root resorption therapy options include close monitoring; tooth extraction; and crown amputation with intentional root retention and gingival closure. Surface resorption is characterized radiographically by a shallow void affecting the cementum located along the margins of the root.
