AB  - Abstract Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members are important regulators of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration. The abnormal expression of certain FGF family members can cause skeletal diseases, including achondroplasia, craniosynostosis syndrome, osteoarthritis, and Kashin?Beck disease. Accumulating evidence shows that FGFs play a crucial role in the growth and proliferation of bone and in the pathogenesis of certain bone-related diseases. Here, we review the involvement of FGFs in bone-related processes and diseases; FGF1 in the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and fracture repair; FGF2, FGF9, and FGF18 in osteoarthritis; FGF6 in bone and muscle injury; FGF8 in osteoarthritis and Kashin?Beck disease; and FGF21 and FGF23 on bone regulation. These findings indicate that FGFs are targets for novel therapeutic interventions for bone-related diseases.

AB  - Abstract The combination of the two techniques of rapid prototyping 3D-plotting and bioactive surface functionalization is presented, with emphasis on the in vitro effect of Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) on primary human osteoblasts (hOBs). Our primary objective was to demonstrate the BSP influence on the expression of distinctive osteoblast markers in hOBs. Secondary objectives included examinations of the scaffolds' surface and the stability of BSP-coating as well as investigations of cell viability and proliferation. 3D-plotted calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds were coated with BSP via physisorption. hOBs were seeded on the coated scaffolds, followed by cell viability measurements, gene expression analysis and visualization. Physisorption is an effective method for BSP-coating. Coating with higher BSP concentrations leads to enhanced BSP release. Two BSP concentrations (50 and 200 ?g/mL) were examined in this study. The lower BSP concentration (50 µg/mL) decreased ALP and SPARC expression, whereas the higher BSP concentration (200 ?g/mL) did not change gene marker expression. Enhanced cell viability was observed on BSP-coated scaffolds on day 3. hOBs developed a polygonal shape and connected in an intercellular network under BSP influence. Quantitative cell morphology analyses demonstrated for BSP-coated CPCs an enhanced cell area and reduced circularity. The strength of the above-mentioned effects of BSP-coated scaffolds in vivo is unknown, and future work is focusing on bone ingrowth and vascularization in vivo. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The lack of a functional vascular supply has, to a large extent, hampered the whole range of clinical applications of ?successful? laboratory-based bone tissue engineering strategies. To the present, grafts have been dependent on post-implant vascularization, which jeopardizes graft integration and often leads to its failure. For this reason, the development of strategies that could effectively induce the establishment of a microcirculation in the engineered constructs has become a major goal for the tissue engineering research community. This review addresses the role and importance of the development of a vascular network in bone tissue engineering and provides an overview of the most up to date research efforts to develop such a network.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2013 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration. As the official journal of The International Federation for Artificial Organs, The International Faculty for Artificial Organs, the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, the International Society for Pediatric Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Support, and the Vienna International Workshop on Functional Electrical Stimulation, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level?. Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide so meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected and especially to those whose native tongue is not English. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our Publisher, Wiley Periodicals, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to recording further advances in the coming years.
