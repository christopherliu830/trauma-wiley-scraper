AB  - Abstract Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of linear polyesters consisting of 3,4, 5 and 6-hydroxyacids, synthesized by a variety of bacterial species. PHAs are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units; short-chain-length (scl) PHAs and medium-chain-length (mcl) PHAs. Biodegradability is an essential material property required for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Various methods of manufacture can be used to alter the biodegradability of PHA devices such as by blending with others polymers, increasing the porosity and increasing the exposed surface area. PHAs have also been demonstrated to be suitable for use as scaffolds in tissue engineering since they are easily degradable and favor proliferation and attachment of cells. In the field of skin tissue engineering research, various skin components, cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors have been used experimentally. Melanocytes have been seeded on various polymer scaffolds, as well as sweat and sebaceous glands.

AB  - ABSTRACT The global impact of the spectrum of valve diseases is a crucial, fast-growing, and underrecognized health problem. The most prevalent valve diseases, requiring surgical intervention, are represented by calcific and degenerative processes occurring in heart valves, in particular, aortic and mitral valve. Due to the increasing elderly population, these pathologies will gain weight in the global health burden. The two most common valve diseases are aortic valve stenosis (AVS) and mitral valve regurgitation (MR). AVS is the most commonly encountered valve disease nowadays and affects almost 5% of elderly population. In particular, AVS poses a great challenge due to the multiple comorbidities and frailty of this patient subset. MR is also a common valve pathology and has an estimated prevalence of 3% in the general population, affecting more than 176 million people worldwide. This review will focus on pathophysiological changes in both these valve diseases, starting from the description of the anatomical aspects of normal valve, highlighting all the main cellular and molecular features involved in the pathological progression and cardiac consequences. This review also evaluates the main approaches in clinical management of these valve diseases, taking into account of the main published clinical guidelines. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Silk fibroin (SF) from Bombyx mori is a promising natural material for the synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels for use in biomedical applications from tissue engineering to drug delivery. However, weak gelation performance and the lack of biochemical cues to trigger cell proliferation and differentiation currently significantly limit its application in these areas. Herein, a biofunctional hydrogel containing SF (2.0%) and a small peptide gelator (e.g., NapFFRGD = 1.0 wt%) is generated via cooperative molecular self-assembly. The introduction of NapFFRGD to SF is shown to significantly improve its gelation properties by lowering both its threshold gelation concentration to 2.0% and gelation time to 20 min under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, 37 °C), as well as functionalizing the SF hydrogel with cell-adhesive motifs (e.g., RGD). Besides mediating cell adhesion, the RGD ligands incorporated within the SF-RGD gel promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated within the gel matrix, leading to bone regeneration in a mouse calvarial defect model, compared with a blank SF gel (2.0%, pH = 7.4). This work suggests that SF could be easily tailored with bioactive peptide gelators to afford bioactive hydrogels with favorable microenvironments for tissue regeneration applications.

AB  - Abstract Mutually interacted musculoskeletal tissues work together within the physiological environment full of varieties of external stimulus. Consistent with the locomotive function of the tissues, musculoskeletal cells are remarkably mechanosensitive to the physical cues. Signals like extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, topography, and geometry can be sensed and transduced into intracellular signaling cascades to trigger a series of cell responses, including cell adhesion, cell phenotype maintenance, cytoskeletal reconstruction, and stem cell differentiation (Du et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017). With the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the potent effects of ECM physical properties on cell behaviors at the cell-matrix interface are drawing much attention. To mimic the interaction between cell and its ECM physical properties, developing advanced biomaterials with desired characteristics which could achieve the biointerface between cells and the surrounded matrix close to the physiological conditions becomes a great hotspot. In this review, based on the current publications in the field of biointerfaces, we systematically summarized the significant roles of stiffness and topography on musculoskeletal cell behaviors. We hope to shed light on the importance of physical cues in musculoskeletal tissue engineering and provide up to date strategies towards the natural or artificial replication of physiological microenvironment.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Objectives were (a) to establish an in vitro coculture model of human PDL-derived fibroblasts (HPDFs) and human alveolar bone-derived osteoblasts (HABOs), and (b) to measure RUNX2 and P2RX7 gene expression at multiple time points after compressive force (CF) stimulation for different durations. Setting/Sample population Human PDL-derived fibroblasts and HABOs from two individuals isolated from extracted teeth of healthy donors due to orthodontic reasons at LMU's Dental School were used. Materials and methods Mono- and cocultured cells were subjected to CF by centrifugation (47.4 g/cm2) for 1, 2 and 4 hours at 30°C. Total RNA was isolated before and 2, 4, 8, 16 minutes after CF application. Expression of RUNX2 and P2RX7 was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results In monocultured cells, an upregulation of RUNX2 and P2RX7 expression was found after all CF durations: RUNX2 twofold in HPDFs after 4 hours (P = 0.002) and 1.7-fold in HABOs after 1 hour (P = 0.009) or 2 hours (P = 0.002) of CF. P2RX7 was significantly upregulated following 1 hour (P = 0.004) and 2 hours (P = 0.002) of CF application in HPDFS. In HABOs, a transient regulation was observed. In cocultured cells, a significant alleviation in gene expression was found for both loci after CF application. In both cell types, RUNX2 expression was significantly reduced in cocultured cells compared to cells in monoculture. P2RX7 expression showed significant attenuation in HPDFs only. Conclusions Cocultivation attenuated the CF induced increase of RUNX2 and P2RX7 gene expression in comparison to monoculture in both cell types. This suggests that intercellular communication may exist between HPDFs and HABOs.
