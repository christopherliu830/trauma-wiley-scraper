AB  - Abstract Poly-(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) has been widely investigated as scaffold material for bone tissue engineering owing to its biosafety, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. However, the bioinert surface of PLGA may fail in regulating cellular behavior and directing osteointegration between the scaffold and the host tissue. In this article, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (oCS) and type I collagen (Col I) were assembled onto PLGA surface via layer by layer technique (LbL) as an adhesive coating for the attachment of inorganic minerals. The multilayer-modified PLGA scaffold was mineralized in vitro to ensure the deposition of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP). It was found that nHAP crystals were more uniformly and firmly attached on the multilayer-modified PLGA as compared with the pure PLGA scaffold, which remarkably improved PLGA surface and mechanical properties. Additionally, in vitro biocompatibility of PLGA scaffold, in terms of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) attachment, spreading and proliferation was greatly enhanced by nHAP coating and multilayer deposition. Furthermore, the fabricated composite scaffold also shows the ability to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the up-regulation of osteogenic marker genes. Thus, this novel biomimetic composite scaffold might achieve a desirable therapeutic result for bone tissue regeneration. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Urinary stones are an ailment that can leave the patients asymptomatic or lead to significant morbidity or even mortality. Understanding the basic concepts of stone formation is vital in its prevention, which is key not only as a preventative measure but also to ensure patients do not form further stones. In this chapter, we discuss the pathophysiology of stone formation as well as the diagnostic and management modalities.

AB  - Abstract Perfusion bioreactor plays important role in supporting 3D bone construct development. Scaffolds of chitosan composites have been studied to support bone tissue regeneration from osteogenic progenitor cells including human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). In this study, porous scaffolds of hydroxyapatite (H), chitosan (C), and gelatin (G) were fabricated by phase-separation and press-fitted in the perfusion bioreactor system where media flow is configured either parallel or transverse with respect to the scaffolds to investigate the impact of flow configuration on hMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The in vitro results showed that the interstitial flow in the transverse flow (TF) constructs reduced cell growth during the first week of culture but improved spatial cell distribution and early onset of osteogenic differentiation measured by alkaline phosphatase and expression of osteogenic genes. After 14 days of bioreactor culture, the TF constructs have comparable cell number but higher expression of bone markers genes and proteins compared to the parallel flow constructs. To evaluate ectopic bone formation, the HCG constructs seeded with hMSCs pre-cultured under two flow configurations for 7 days were implanted in CD-1 nude mice. While Masson's Trichrom staining revealed bone formation in both constructs, the TF constructs have improved spatial cell and osteoid distribution throughout the 2.0 mm constructs. The results highlight the divergent effects of media flow over the course of construct development and suggest that the flow configuration is an important parameter regulating the cellular events leading to bone construct formation in the HCG scaffolds. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary For explaining such a fundamental and contradictory phenomenon as self-maintenance of the pool of hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and subsequent choice of differentiation program into this or that hemopoietic lineage, Schofield (1978) put forward a hypothesis on a hemopoietic niche (specialized cell microenvironment). Schofield's paper gave rise to 30-year studies devoted to hypothetic models and various aspects of HSC niche functioning and hierarchy. Detection of close contacts between HSCs and osteoblasts located in the endosteum and adventitial cells of blood vessels made a scientific breakthrough in this field, and the existence of osteoblastic and vascular niches for HSCs has been postulated since 2003. One of the promising directions is the design and modification of materials for control over the fate of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) that will allow stroma of various human and animal organs and tissues to be constructed. However, the discussion about the existence and functioning of MMSCs niche is only developing. The design of artificial materials capable of biomimetical reproducing of the cellular and tissue microenvironment based on ideas and main elements borrowed from wildlife is a main direction in the development of medical materials technology and tissue bioengineering. Scaffold technology is an experimental approach to the search of the stem cell niches. Recent attempts to model the microterritories (niches) for HSCs have been undertaken and the behavior of cells in such structures has been investigated. However, the main quantitative factors involved in the original design of stem cell microterritories remain unknown. It hampers the development of cell biology and tissue engineering. At the modern stage, the topography, hierarchy, and the size of the niches have to be determined, because the definition of the niches as morphological (structural and functional) units (microterritories), which provides the conditions for vital activity of stem cells, implies finite values of its parameters. The aim of the chapter was the critical review of key milestones of the niche concept for HSCs and MMSCs as we understood it. We speculated our definition of the stem cell niche proposed and described certain stages (postulated; morphofunctional; topographical; quantitative; bioengineering) of the niche theory development as well as prospective directions of the niche designing for regenerative medicine were noted.

AB  - Abstract Angiogenesis and inflammation are clearly interconnected and interdependent processes that are dysregulated in a series of systemic and brain pathologies. Herein, key aspects regarding endothelial cell function and tissue remodelling that are particularly affected or aggravated by inflammation are presented. Most importantly, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the vascular regulation of the inflammatory processes occurring in several brain disorders and how they impact on disease/injury progression are detailed, highlighting potential targets for therapy. Finally, nanomedicine-based approaches designed to overcome limitations pertaining to low systemic bioavailability, light, pH and temperature sensitivity and/or rapid degradation of these targets, and to optimize their mode of action are discussed. Ultimately, we expect this review to provide new insight and to suggest novel approaches for the treatment of blood?brain barrier dysfunction per se or as a means to treat the injured or diseased central nervous system.
