AB  - Abstract Objectives The aim of this study was to understand the effect of substrate stiffness (a mechanical factor of the extracellular matrix) on periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and its underlying mechanism. Materials and methods Elastic substrates were fabricated by mixing 2 components, a base and curing agent in proportions of 10:1, 20:1, 30:1 or 40:1. PDLSC morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed after PDLSCs was cultured on various elastic substrates. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Results SEM revealed variations in the morphology of PDLSCs cultured on elastic substrates. PDLSC proliferation increased with substrate stiffness (P < .05). Osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs was higher on stiff substrates. Notch pathway markers were up-regulated in PDLSCs cultured on stiff substrates. Conclusions Results suggested that the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs might be promoted by culturing them in a stiffness-dependent manner, which regulates the Notch pathway. This might provide a new method of enhancing osteogenesis in PDLSCs.

AB  - Abstract Engineered scaffolds function to supplement or replace injured, missing, or compromised tissue or organs. The current direction in this research area is to create scaffolds that mimic the structure and function of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). It is believed that the fabrication of a scaffold that has both structural integrity and allows for normal cellular function and interaction will bring scaffolds closer to clinical relevance. Nanotechnology innovations have aided in the development of techniques for the production of nanofiber scaffolds. The three major processing techniques, self-assembly, phase separation, and electrospinning, produce fibers that rival the size of those found in the native ECM. However, the simplicity, versatility, and scalability of electrospinning make it an attractive processing method that can be used to reproduce aspects of the complexity that characterizes the native ECM. Novel electrospinning strategies include alterations of scaffold composition and architecture, along with the addition and encapsulation of cells, pharmaceuticals and growth factors within the scaffold. This article reviews the major nanofiber fabrication technologies as well as delves into recent significant contributions to the conception of a meaningful and practical electrospun scaffold.

AB  - Inflammatory pathologies are a growing burden for developed societies, and the tools offered by medicinal chemistry/biotechnology have provided us with an armamentarium of active principles. Unfortunately, most of them are marred by very significant side effects that can be summarized by two words: poor targeting (of cells, of tissues, etc.). This review provides a broad overview of the approaches and of the materials used to obtain an inflammation-responsive or inflammation-targeted behavior, which can be used to improve anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we first define the biochemical factors that may allow both to recognize and to target an inflamed environment, for example, the leakiness of capillaries, the presence of oxidants (reactive oxygen species), or of upregulated receptors/enzymes. We then review the systems that have shown the possibility to accumulate in inflamed tissues, respond to its stimuli, or bind to activated inflammatory cells, separately discussing payload/carrier (guest/host) systems and macromolecular prodrugs/conjugates.

AB  - Abstract Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has received significant attention due to its enormous potential in treating critical-sized bone defects and related diseases. Traditional materials such as metals, ceramics, and polymers have been widely applied as BTE scaffolds; however, their clinical applications have been rather limited due to various considerations. Recently, carbon-based nanomaterials attract significant interests for their applications as BTE scaffolds due to their superior properties, including excellent mechanical strength, large surface area, tunable surface functionalities, high biocompatibility as well as abundant and inexpensive nature. In this article, recent studies and advancements on the use of carbon-based nanomaterials with different dimensions such as graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots, for BTE are reviewed. Current challenges of carbon-based nanomaterials for BTE and future trends in BTE scaffolds development are also highlighted and discussed.

AB  - The effective regulation of fluid shear stress (FSS) on the lineage specification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains to be addressed. We hypothesized that when MSCs are recruited to musculoskeletal system following stimulation, their differentiation into osteogenic or chondrogenic cells is directed by the rate of FSS (?SS) through modulation of the mechanosensitive, cation-selective channels (MSCCs), intracellular calcium levels, and F-actin. To this end, MSCs were exposed to laminar FSS linearly increased from 0 to 10?dyn/cm2 in 0, 2, or 20?min and maintained at 10?dyn/cm2 for a total of 20?min (termed as ?SS 0-0?, 0-2?, and 0-20?, respectively, representing more physiological (0-0?) and non-physiological (0-2? and 0-20?) ?SS treatments). Our results showed 0-0? facilitated MSC differentiation towards chondrogenic and not osteogenic phenotype, by promoting moderate intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase from the calcium channels with the exception of MSCCs or intracellular calcium stores, and F-actin organization. In contrast, 0-2? promoted MSCs towards osteogenic and not chondrogenic phenotype, by inducing significant [Ca2+]i increase mainly from the MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. However, 0-20? elicited the modest osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes, as it induced the lowest [Ca2+]i increase mainly from MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. Our results suggest that compared to the more physiological ?SS, the non-physiological ?SS favors [Ca2+]i influx from MSCCs. An appropriate non-physiological ?SS (0-2?) even elicits a large [Ca2+]i influx from the MSCCs that reverses the lineage specification of MSCs, providing validation for the high mechanosensitivity of MSCs and guidance for training osteoporosis and osteoarthritis patients.

AB  - Abstract In two independent and separate studies, we have shown that renal injury and chronic kidney disease (CKD) directly inhibit skeletal anabolism, and that stimulation of bone formation decreased the serum phosphate. In the first study, the serum Ca PO4, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitriol were maintained normal after renal ablation in mice, and even mild renal injury equivalent to stage 3 CKD decreased bone formation rates. More recently, these observations were rediscovered in low-density lipoprotein receptor null (LDLR-/?) mice fed high-fat/cholesterol diets, a model of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance). We demonstrated that these mice have vascular calcification (VC) of both the intimal atherosclerotic type and medial calcification. We have also shown that VC is made worse by CKD and ameliorated by bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7). The finding that high-fat fed LDLR-/? animals with CKD had hyperphosphatemia which was prevented in BMP-7-treated animals lead us to examine the skeletons of these mice. It was found that significant reductions in bone formation rates were associated with high-fat feeding, and superimposing CKD resulted in the adynamic bone disorder (ABD), while VC was made worse. The effect of CKD to decrease skeletal anabolism (decreased bone formation rates and reduced number of bone modelling units) occurred despite secondary hyperparathyroidism. The BMP-7 treatment corrected the ABD and hyperphosphatemia, owing to BMP-7-driven stimulation of skeletal phosphate deposition reducing plasma phosphate and thereby removing a major stimulus to VC. A pathological link between abnormal bone mineralization and VC through the serum phosphorus was demonstrated by the partial effectiveness of directly reducing the serum phosphate by a phosphate binder that had no skeletal action. Thus, in the metabolic syndrome with CKD, a reduction in bone forming potential of osteogenic cells leads to the ABD producing hyperphosphatemia and VC, processes ameliorated by BMP-7, in part through increased bone formation and skeletal deposition of phosphate and in part through direct actions on vascular smooth muscle cells. We have demonstrated that the processes leading to vascular calcification begin with even mild levels of renal injury affecting the skeleton before demonstrable hyperphosphatemia and that they are preventable and treatable. Therefore, early intervention in the skeletal disorder associated with CKD is warranted and may affect mortality of the disease.
