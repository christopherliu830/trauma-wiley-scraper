AB  - Human mesenchymal or stromal cells (hMSCs) isolated from various adult tissues are primary candidates in cell therapy and tissue regeneration. Despite promising results in preclinical studies, robust therapeutic responses to MSC treatment have not been reproducibly demonstrated in clinical trials. In the translation of MSC-based therapy to clinical application, studies of MSC metabolism have significant implication in optimizing bioprocessing conditions to obtain therapeutically competent hMSC population for clinical application. In addition, understanding the contribution of metabolic cues in directing hMSC fate also provides avenues to potentiate their therapeutic effects by modulating their metabolic properties. This review focuses on MSC metabolism and discusses their unique metabolic features in the context of common metabolic properties shared by stem cells. Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of MSC metabolic characteristics in relation to their in vivo origin and metabolic regulation during proliferation, lineage-specific differentiation, and exposure to in vivo ischemic conditions are summarized. Metabolic strategies in directing MSC fate to enhance their therapeutic potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are discussed. ? 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The study of classic papers permits analysis of the past, present, and future of a specific area of knowledge. This type of analysis is becoming more frequent and more sophisticated. Our objective was to use the H-classics method, based on the h-index, to analyze classic papers in Implant Dentistry, Periodontics, and Oral Surgery (ID, P, and OS). Material and methods First, an electronic search of documents related to ID, P, and OS was conducted in journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2014 within the category ?Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine?. Second, Web of Knowledge databases were searched using Mesh terms related to ID, P, and OS. Finally, the H-classics method was applied to select the classic articles in these disciplines, collecting data on associated research areas, document type, country, institutions, and authors. Results Of 267,611 documents related to ID, P, and OS retrieved from JCR journals (2014), 248 were selected as H-classics. They were published in 35 journals between 1953 and 2009, most frequently in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology (18.95%), the Journal of Periodontology (18.54%), International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants (9.27%), and Clinical Oral Implant Research (6.04%). These classic articles derived from the USA in 49.59% of cases and from Europe in 47.58%, while the most frequent host institution was the University of Gothenburg (17.74%) and the most frequent authors were J. Lindhe (10.48%) and S. Socransky (8.06%). Conclusion The H-classics approach offers an objective method to identify core knowledge in clinical disciplines such as ID, P, and OS.

AB  - Abstract Migrating cells continually develop new substrate attachments at the leading edge (LE) in order to maintain traction for movement. This study evaluates the relationship between LE adhesion and wound closure by modulating injury-derived intracellular free Ca2+ [Ca2+]i) signaling in endothelial cell (EC) monolayers following scrape-wounding. These data show that brief treatment with increased extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e) during wounding accelerated wound area closure rates by 50?65%, while brief treatments with calcium influx inhibitors reduced rates by 30?50%. Fura-2 studies in wounded monolayers indicated supranormal [Ca2+]e during wounding increased (by 52%), while influx-inhibitors decreased (by 36%) the percentage of cells exhibiting elevated plateau [Ca2+]i levels. Quantitative time-lapse interference reflection microscopy (IRM) together with indirect αv?3 integrin immunofluorescence was used to measure the effects of 100 ?M Gd3+ and 5 mM [Ca2+]e treatment on fractional LE adhesion after wounding. Influx inhibition blocked development of increased injury-derived LE adhesion. Measurements indicated a linear relationship (r2 = 0.99, 0.98) between LE adhesion, development rates (quantified as an association rate constant) and steady state wound closure rates. Changes in filopodial activity, as indicated by phase contrast microscopy, did not correlate with changes in wound closure rates, but an association existed between the percentile peak [Ca2+]i response and the initiation of filopodial activity, suggesting a role for filopodia in mediating Ca2+-sensitive acceleration. Taken together, our data suggest that injury-derived [Ca2+]i signaling may regulate wound closure rates by an adhesion-mediated mechanism. J. Cell. Physiol. 174:217?231, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Marine mussels secret protein-based adhesives, which enable them to anchor to various surfaces in a saline, intertidal zone. Mussel foot proteins (Mfps) contain a large abundance of a unique, catecholic amino acid, Dopa, in their protein sequences. Catechol offers robust and durable adhesion to various substrate surfaces and contributes to the curing of the adhesive plaques. In this article, we review the unique features and the key functionalities of Mfps, catechol chemistry, and strategies for preparing catechol-functionalized polymers. Specifically, we reviewed recent findings on the contributions of various features of Mfps on interfacial binding, which include coacervate formation, surface drying properties, control of the oxidation state of catechol, among other features. We also summarized recent developments in designing advanced biomimetic materials including coacervate-forming adhesives, mechanically improved nano- and micro-composite adhesive hydrogels, as well as smart and self-healing materials. Finally, we review the applications of catechol-functionalized materials for the use as biomedical adhesives, therapeutic applications, and antifouling coatings. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in molecular biology, neurobiology, genetics, and imaging have demonstrated important insights about the nature of neurological diseases. However, a comprehensive understanding of their pathogenesis is still lacking. Although reductionism has been successful in enumerating and characterizing the components of most living organisms, it has failed to generate knowledge on how these components interact in complex arrangements to allow and sustain two of the most fundamental properties of the organism as a whole: its fitness, also termed its robustness, and its capacity to evolve. Systems biology complements the classic reductionist approaches in the biomedical sciences by enabling integration of available molecular, physiological, and clinical information in the context of a quantitative framework typically used by engineers. Systems biology employs tools developed in physics and mathematics such as nonlinear dynamics, control theory, and modeling of dynamic systems. The main goal of a systems approach to biology is to solve questions related to the complexity of living systems such as the brain, which cannot be reconciled solely with the currently available tools of molecular biology and genomics. As an example of the utility of this systems biological approach, network-based analyses of genes involved in hereditary ataxias have demonstrated a set of pathways related to RNA splicing, a novel pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. Network-based analysis is also challenging the current nosology of neurological diseases. This new knowledge will contribute to the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches, bringing the paradigm of personalized medicine one step closer to reality. Ann Neurol 2009;65:124?139
