AB  - Abstract Even mildly hypothermic body or limb temperatures can retard healing processes in mammals. Despite this, we observed that hibernating American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) elicit profound abilities in mounting inflammatory responses to infection and/or foreign bodies. In addition, they resolve injuries during hibernation while maintaining mildly hypothermic states (30?35 °C) and without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. We describe experimental studies on free-ranging bears that document their abilities to completely resolve cutaneous cuts and punctures incurred during or prior to hibernation. We induced small, full-thickness cutaneous wounds (biopsies or incisions) during early denning, and re-biopsied sites 2?3 months later (near the end of denning). Routine histological methods were used to characterize these skin samples. All biopsied sites with respect to secondary intention (open circular biopsies) and primary intention (sutured sites) healed, with evidence of initial eschar (scab) formation, completeness of healed epidermis and dermal layers, dyskeratosis (inclusion cysts), and abilities to produce hair follicles. These healing abilities of hibernating black bears are a clear survival advantage to animals injured before or during denning. Bears are known to have elevated levels of hibernation induction trigger (delta-opioid receptor agonist) and ursodeoxycholic acid (major bile acid within plasma, mostly conjugated with taurine) during hibernation, which may relate to these wound-healing abilities. Further research as to the underlying mechanisms of wound healing during hibernation could have applications in human medicine. Unique approaches may be found to improve healing for malnourished, hypothermic, diabetic and elderly patients or to reduce scarring associated with burns and traumatic injuries.

AB  - Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is commonly used in combination with the installment of titanium implants. The application of a membrane to exclude non-osteogenic tissues from interfering with bone regeneration is a key principle of GBR. Membrane materials possess a number of properties which are amenable to modification. A large number of membranes have been introduced for experimental and clinical verification. This prompts the need for an update on membrane properties and the biological outcomes, as well as a critical assessment of the biological mechanisms governing bone regeneration in defects covered by membranes. The relevant literature for this narrative review was assessed after a MEDLINE/PubMed database search. Experimental data suggest that different modifications of the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes may promote bone regeneration. Nevertheless, the precise role of membrane porosities for the barrier function of GBR membranes still awaits elucidation. Novel experimental findings also suggest an active role of the membrane compartment per se in promoting the regenerative processes in the underlying defect during GBR, instead of being purely a passive barrier. The optimization of membrane materials by systematically addressing both the barrier and the bioactive properties is an important strategy in this field of research.

AB  - Abstract 3D bioprinting field is making remarkable progress; however, the development of critical sized engineered tissue construct is still a farfetched goal. Silk fibroin offers a promising choice for bioink material. Nature has imparted several unique structural features in silk protein to ensure spinnability by silkworms or spider. Researchers have modified the structure?property relationship by reverse engineering to further improve shear thinning behavior, high printability, cytocompatible gelation, and high structural fidelity. In this review, it is attempted to summarize the recent advancements made in the field of 3D bioprinting in context of two major sources of silk fibroin: silkworm silk and spider silk (native and recombinant). The challenges faced by current approaches in processing silk bioinks, cellular signaling pathways modulated by silk chemistry and secondary conformations, gaps in knowledge, and future directions acquired for pushing the field further toward clinic are further elaborated.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors ?? Shi S, Bartold PM, Miura M, Seo BM, Robey PG, Gronthos S Objectives ?? Identification, characterization, and potential application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human dental tissues. Methods ?? Dental pulp and periodontal ligament were obtained from normal human impacted third molars. The tissues were digested in collagenase/dispase to generate single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2?mM l-glutamine, 100??M l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting were employed to characterize the phenotype of freshly isolated and ex vivo expanded cell populations. The developmental potential of cultured cells was assessed following co-transplantation with hydroxyapetite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) particles into immunocompromised mice for 8?weeks. Results ?? MSC were identified in adult human dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells, DPSC), human primary teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, SHED), and periodontal ligament (periodontal ligament stem cells, PDLSC) by their capacity to generate clongenic cell clusters in culture. Ex vivo expanded DPSC, SHED, and PDLSC populations expressed a heterogeneous assortment of makers associated with MSC, dentin, bone, smooth muscle, neural tissue, and endothelium. PDLSC were also found to express the tendon specific marker, Scleraxis. Xenogeneic transplants containing HA/TCP with either DPSC or SHED generated donor-derived dentin-pulp-like tissues with distinct odontoblast layers lining the mineralized dentin-matrix. In parallel studies, PDLSC generated cementum-like structures associated with PDL-like connective tissue when transplanted with HA/TCP into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion ?? Collectively, these data revealed the presence of distinct MSC populations associated with dental structures with the potential of stem cells to regenerate living human dental tissues in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Adipose tissue represents an abundant and easily accessible source of multipotent cells, which may serve as excellent building blocks for tissue engineering. This article presents a newly described protocol for isolating adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) from human lipoaspirate, compared to the standard protocol for harvesting ASCs established in 2001. Human ASC isolation is performed using two methods, and resultant cells are compared through cell yield, cell viability, cell proliferation and regenerative potential. The osteogenic and adipogenic potential of ASCs isolated using both protocols are assessed in vitro and gene expression analysis is performed. The focus of this series of protocols is the regenerative potential of both cell populations in vivo. As such, the two in vivo animal models described are fat graft retention (soft tissue reconstruction) and calvarial defect healing (bone regeneration). The techniques described comprise fat grafting with cell assisted lipotransfer, and calvarial defect creation healed with cell-seeded scaffolds. ? 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Craniofacial (CF) tissue is an architecturally complex tissue consisting of both bone and soft tissues with significant patient specific variations. Conditions of congenital abnormalities, tumor resection surgeries, and traumatic injuries of the CF skeleton can result in major deficits of bone tissue. Despite advances in surgical reconstruction techniques, management of CF osseous deficits remains a challenge. Due its inherent versatility, bioprinting offers a promising solution to address these issues. In this review, we present and analyze the current state of bioprinting of bone tissue and highlight how these techniques may be adapted to serve regenerative therapies for CF applications.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A review is undertaken of redent model systems and cell culture studies that address the role of periodontal fibroblasts in tissue homeostasis in both normal function and after wound healing. RATIONALE: Fibroblasts are the predominant cells of the periodontal ligament (PL) and of healthy gingiva and have important roles in the development, function and regeneration of the tooth support apparatus. REVIEW: In normally functioning periodontal tissues cell turnover involves generation of new cells by proliferation which in turn is balanced by apoptotic cell death. Consequently PL fibroblasts comprise a renewal cell system in steady-state. PL cell progenitors can generate multiple types of more differentiated, specialized cells including latge numbers of fibroblastic cells and more limited numbers of osteogenic or cementogenic cells. However PL fibroblasts constitutively block osteogenesis and thereby maintain the PL width. Proliferating progenitor cell populations of the PL are enriched in locations adjacent to blood vessels and in contiguous endosteal spaces from where they migrate to the body of the PL. Large increases of cell formation and cell differentiation occur after wounding but surprisingly, the cells that repopulate the PL adjacent to the root surface are largely post-mitotic. As PL cell populations comprise multiple lineages, it is likely that after wounding, the separate phenotypes repopulating the wound site will be selected by environmental factors. Further, the specific repopulating lineages will strongly influence the form and function of the nascent tissue. To illustrate the specificity of fibroblast functions, examples of migratory and contractile fibroblast phenotypes are provided which exhibit constitutively different levels of gelsolin and α-smooth muscle actin respectively, cytoskeletal proteins which are markers for these cell types. CONCLUSION: Fibroblasts contribute to PL homeostasis by their abilities to remodel tissues, to repopulate wounds, to influence the metabolism of other cell types and to create a new fibrous attachment.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract Several attempts have been made to engineer a viable three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue equivalent using conventional tissue engineering strategies, but with limited clinical success. Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.
