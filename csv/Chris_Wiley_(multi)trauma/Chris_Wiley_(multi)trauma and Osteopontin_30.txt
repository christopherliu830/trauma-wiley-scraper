AB  - Advanced drug delivery systems employing controlled release technology are being developed to address many of the difficulties associated with traditional methods of drug administration. Controlled release technology involves the use of devices such as polymer-based disks, rods, pellets, or microspheres (MSs) that encapsulate drugs, genes, cytokines, and growth factors and release them in specific location within the body in a controlled fashion, for relatively long periods of time. Among these, microencapsulation is one of the core technologies used in polymer-based drug delivery systems. In this regard, MS serves as microcarriers for sustain drug release facilitating their use for invasive or minimally invasive treatment. MS has significant potential for the application in bone repair, intra-articular treatment of osteoarthritis, and biological bone growth. The present review compiles the recent advances in polymeric MS for application in bone and cartilage regeneration. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this meeting is to emphasize entrepreneurship and opportunities in industry as a valuable part of our profession, bringing the benefits of new ideas and techniques generated by the basic scientists to the broad patient population. Thinking outside the traditional ?clinical Medical Physics box?, there are a variety of ways that individuals can use their medical physics training/experience in entrepreneurial endeavors. Whether as an individual, a small group of medical physicists, or part of an industry (corporate) environment, the speakers will explore how current students and trainees can make a veritable impact to our profession in a non-clinical setting. Our distinguished speakers will also be happy to answer general questions from the audience.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on the balance of adipogenesis and osteogenesis on steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (OFH) in rats. Forty-two rats were divided into three groups: Steroid group (S, n?=?16); Steroid?+?PEMF group (S?+?P, n?=?16); and Control group (C, n?=?10). For groups S and S?+?P, all rats were first intravenously given 10?µg/kg lipopolysaccharide on day 1, and then intramuscularly injected with 20?mg/kg methylprednisolone acetate on days 2, 3, and 4, with an interval of 24?h. After 4 weeks, the S?+?P group was treated with PEMF (4.5-ms square pulse, repeated at 15?Hz, with a peak of 1.2?mT) for 4?h a day for the next 8 weeks. Group S was not exposed to PEMF. Group C was chosen as the control group, without steroid use and exposure to PEMF. After 8 weeks of treatment, the histological changes, and mRNA and protein expressions of PPAR-?2 and Runx2 were measured and analyzed. Compared with the S group, lower incidence of osteonecrosis (31% vs. 69%, P?<?0.05) and empty osteocyte lacuna rate (36.16?±?15.34 vs. 59.55?±?21.70, P?<?0.01) was observed in the S?+?P group. Furthermore, PEMF suppressed the expressions of PPAR-?2 and improved the expressions of Runx2 in the femoral head (P?<?0.05). All data suggest that PEMF is an effective physiotherapy in the treatment of steroid-induced ONFH, and the possible underlying mechanisms include protecting the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering and stem cell therapy hold great potential of being able to fully restore, repair and replace damaged, diseased or lost tissues in the body. Biocompatible porous scaffolds are used for the delivery of cells to the regeneration sites. Marrow stromal cells (MSCs), also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, are an attractive cell source for tissue engineering, due to the relative ease of isolation and the ability of in vitro expanded MSCs to generate multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. This study utilized a novel technique called microwave vacuum drying to fabricate porous gelatin?alginate scaffolds for the delivery of MSCs and investigated the differential in vitro and in vivo responses of MSCs seeded on these scaffolds. Scaffold total porosity was found to decrease with increased cross-link density but the pore size and pore size distribution were not affected. Although highly porous, the scaffold had relatively small pores and limited interconnectivity. The porous gelatin?alginate scaffold demonstrated excellent biocompatibility with neovascularization on the surfaces and was bioresorbed completely in vivo, depending upon the cross-link density. MSCs were able to attach and proliferate at the same rate on the scaffolds, and the self-renewal potential of MSC cultures was similar during both in vitro culture and in vivo implantation. However, the subcutaneous microenvironment was found to suppress MSC differentiation along the osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages compared to in vitro conditions, highlighting the differential responses of MSCs cultured in vitro compared to implantation in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Many years of research have resulted in the successful examples of immunotherapies for many diseases including cancers and inflammatory diseases. These new treatments are referred to as biological therapies-such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine therapies. The recent technological advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) development have caused significant investment and interest in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Therefore, this chapter will highlight these new advances in the biological therapy arena.
