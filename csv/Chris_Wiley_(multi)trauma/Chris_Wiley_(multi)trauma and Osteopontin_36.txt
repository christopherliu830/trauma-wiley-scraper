AB  - Summary Persons with type 1 or type 2 diabetes have a significantly higher fracture risk than age-matched persons without diabetes, attributed to disease-specific deficits in the microarchitecture and material properties of bone tissue. Therefore, independent effects of diabetes drugs on skeletal integrity are vitally important. Studies of incretin-based therapies have shown divergent effects of different agents on fracture risk, including detrimental, beneficial, and neutral effects. The sulfonylurea class of drugs, owing to its hypoglycemic potential, is thought to amplify the risk of fall-related fractures, particularly in the elderly. Other agents such as the biguanides may, in fact, be osteo-anabolic. In contrast, despite similarly expected anabolic properties of insulin, data suggests that insulin pharmacotherapy itself, particularly in type 2 diabetes, may be a risk factor for fracture, negatively associated with determinants of bone quality and bone strength. Finally, sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of atypical fractures in select populations, and possibly with an increase in lower extremity amputation with specific SGLT2I drugs. The role of skeletal muscle, as a potential mediator and determinant of bone quality, is also a relevant area of exploration. Currently, data regarding the impact of glucose lowering medications on diabetes-related muscle atrophy is more limited, although preclinical studies suggest that various hypoglycemic agents may have either aggravating (sulfonylureas, glinides) or repairing (thiazolidinediones, biguanides, incretins) effects on skeletal muscle atrophy, thereby influencing bone quality. Hence, the therapeutic efficacy of each hypoglycemic agent must also be evaluated in light of its impact, alone or in combination, on musculoskeletal health, when determining an individualized treatment approach. Moreover, the effect of newer medications (potentially seeking expanded clinical indication into the pediatric age range) on the growing skeleton is largely unknown. Herein, we review the available literature regarding effects of diabetes pharmacotherapy, by drug class and/or by clinical indication, on the musculoskeletal health of persons with diabetes.

AB  - Aims:? A method to test the axial and transverse tensile properties of skin was developed in order to improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of skin, and how it changes with the scarring response. This experimental technique was used to investigate the bidirectional mechanics of skin in the juvenile Yorkshire pig model. Methods:? Skin samples were taken upon sacrifice, and all subcutaneous tissue was carefully removed via dissection. Dumbbell-shaped specimens were obtained from the skin using a custom designed stainless steel punch, to provide consistent geometry, and to avoid stress concentrations that can result from specimen gripping. Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions. Specimens were secured in an INSTRON universal test machine with serrated soft tissue grips, elongated to a desired preload, subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period. They were then returned to the original length and failed in tension at constant velocity. Results:? This method of sample preparation indicated high repeatability in specimen geometry, showing standard deviations of 2% and 3% in gauge length and width, respectively (N?=?12). Furthermore, no slippage was observed at the skin/grip interface, and all failures occurred within the specimen gauge length. Conclusions:? This technique shows great promise for evaluating the viscoelastic and failure properties of skin, scar tissue, and pathologic scarring. Combining this biomechanical method with our parallel studies in molecular biology and biochemistry can likely produce correlations between constituent material organization and the mechanical properties of the tissue, as well as provide valuable information for the design of bioengineered tissue constructs.

AB  - Despite recent advances in wound care, chronic infected ulcers still remain a huge challenge to the modern society. Nitric oxide has been identified as a mediator for important biological processes such as vasodilation, antimicrobial, and wound repair. The aim of the present study was to explore the antimicrobial properties of exogenous nitric oxide gas (gNO) as well as its effect on skin cells in vitro. To test this, a specialized gNO chamber was designed to expose S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in saline continuously to 200?ppm gNO or air. A colony count was obtained following gNO treatment. Furthermore, fibroblast-populated collagen gel, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM, KSFM, and M199, respectively. Endothelial migration was tested by a 3D Matrigel tubule formation assay. Fibroblast matrix production and keratinocyte differentiation were monitored by mRNA expression of procollagen type I, interstitial collagenase, and involucrin. All cells were exposed to 200?ppm gNO for 8 hours a day for 3 consecutive days. A MTT assay was used to observe cell proliferation. The results revealed 100% bacterial kill following 4 hour exposure to 200?ppm gNO. Interestingly this dose did not exhibit any significant toxic effect on fibroblast, keratinocyte, and endothelial proliferation. Dermal fibroblasts migration out of the collagen gel was not affected by gNO treatment when compared to the control. The keratinocytes in both groups were able to express involucrin, an indicator of cell?s ability to differentiate. The migration and tube formation by endothelial cells within the matrigel was not compromised following gNO treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence for potential application of gNO for reducing bacterial burden in chronic infected wounds without compromising re-epithilialization, proliferation, and angiogenesis in the wound healing process.

AB  - Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the binding and diffusion of growth factors in model extracellular matrices in order to investigate the importance of protein-matrix interactions in regulating signaling molecules within a three-dimensional matrix. Two important growth factors were studied, transforming growth factor ?1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are known to have specific affinities for fibronectin and the heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan perlecan, respectively. Collagen-based matrices were prepared by polymerizing type I collagen in the presence of fibronectin or perlecan, and we measured diffusion constants and binding constants of the two growth factors. The binding constant measured for transforming growth factor ?1 with fibronectin-containing matrices was in good agreement with that measured using affinity chromatography. However, the interactions measured between fibroblast growth factor and perlecan were significantly weaker than expected. Surprisingly, the strongest interactions by far were with monomeric collagen solutions and fibrillar collagen matrices. Our findings suggest a central role for the three-dimensional fibrillar collagen matrix in growth factor interactions, with modulatory roles for fibronectin or perlecan.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are present in saliva and may impact wound healing within the oral cavity. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that psychosocial factors such as elevated depression scores are associated with delayed oral wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between salivary levels of EGF and VEGF and depression and loneliness scores. Whole saliva was collected from 43 individuals in groups aged 18?35 years and 50+?years. On the same day, volunteers were asked to complete the Beck?s Depression Inventory (BDI) and the UCLA loneliness scale. Salivary concentrations of EGF and VEGF were determined by standard ELISA. Mean concentrations of EGF and VEGF were 2860?pg/ml and 421?pg/ml, respectively. In the younger age group, significant negative correlations were found between scores on the BDI and UCLA indices and salivary levels of EGF. A median split, based upon BDI scores, similarly revealed that more depressed or lonely individuals exhibited significantly lower EGF levels. A similar trend was observed for VEGF. These preliminary results indicate that psychosocial factors such as depression and loneliness may be related to growth factor expression in saliva. This, in turn, may play a part in the delayed mucosal wound healing observed in depressed individuals. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Wound healing is a complex biological event orchestrated by various resident and infiltrating cell types spanning multiple stages. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease released upon wounding, stimulates fibroblasts and macrophages at the sites of wounds to express, chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have used cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanisms involved in thrombin induces IL-8 expression in human macrophages. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR show that thrombin stimulates IL-8 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. Various inhibitors for signal transduction proteins were used to delineate the pathways involved. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibitors for both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NFÉ»B strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced production of IL-8 suggesting that they are major regulators of this stimulation. JNK was shown to be phorsphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to thrombin treatment confirming its involvement. In order to identify the mediator of JNK and the thrombin receptor, we use affinity pull down and found that Rho GTPase was activated by thrombin suggesting that Rho may be the mediator of JNK activation. In addition, we found that PKC is a negative regulator of thrombin-induced IL-8 expression. Our study broadens the horizon of how IL-8 is regulated in wound healing and may help develop pharmaceutical methods to manipulate this process in pathological conditions.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the effects of hibernation drugs on early wound sepsis in severely scalded rats. Methods:? Sprague-Dawley rats inflicted 30% TBSA deep thickness were randomly divided into A (immediate resuscitation) and B (immediate resuscitation and lytic cocktail). After infusion of 108?CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound on third postburn day, survival was compared between two groups. Local tissue samples and plasma were collected and the plasma level of IL-2 mRNA, IL-4 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA, and IFN-? mRNA were assayed by fluorescence PCR. Results:? Compared with Group A, host survival significantly increased (0.663?±?0.026, P?<?0.01), viscera injury decrease in group B after infusion bacteria. The plasma Th1 cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IFN-?) levels in B group were significantly increased compared with A group. However, the plasma Th2 cytokine mRNA (IL-4, IL-10) levels in group B were not as significantly increased as group A. Conclusions:? Immediate resuscitation with hibernation drugs can decrease viscera injury after sepsis, increase host survival and improve host immune system by preventing Th1 cell from over activation and decrease Th2 cytokines.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that ends with scar formation in adult skin. In contrast, fetal skin within the first and second trimesters of development heals without a scar. One of the most important aspects of scarless fetal wound repair appears to be the lack of inflammation in these wounds, suggesting that acute inflammation can promote scar formation in the skin. While it is well accepted that inflammation causes scar formation in the fetus, it is not known what specific factors produced during inflammation are responsible for these effects. The present experiments tested the possibility that oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells can contribute to scar tissue production by inducing inflammation in the fetus. Using a murine fetal wound repair model we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide increased E15 (embryonic day 15) fibroblast proliferation and ultimately interfered with scarless healing in E15 skin, possibly through the induction of TGF-?1. Defining the factors produced during the inflammatory response that contribute to scar formation could be important for the development of new therapies designed to minimize adult scarring.
