AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It has been speculated that a prolonged and elevated neutrophilic response has an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds. This has raised the possibility that one or more of these proteases might be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for chronic wounds. The purpose of this study was to examine several primarily neutrophil-derived proteases present in pressure ulcer tissues and to determine whether protease activity could be correlated with neutrophil levels. Biopsies of pressure ulcers were taken from consented subjects (n?=?13) and again after 3 months standard care. Mean wound volume decreased 2.4?cm3 per month; however, volumes of six wounds were increased at the end of the study. Levels of extractable myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and gelatinase (MMP-9) activities were determined. Mean levels of MPO (n?=?11) at study initiation and after 3 months were nearly identical (2945 and 2845 milliunits per mg extract, respectively). Interestingly, these levels were similar to that previously found in healing open dermal wounds at 4 days postwounding. MPO levels increased in the extracts obtained from three subjects and declined in five subjects. Elastase (corr. 0.265 p?=?0.233) and MMP-8 (corr. ?0.05 p?=?0.835) activities correlated poorly with MPO. This is likely a reflection of differences in the access of protease inhibitors (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin, TIMP, and alpha2?macroglobulin) to these wounds. As expected, a greater correlation level was observed between the proteases (MMP-8 vs. elastase corr. 0.362 p?=?0.097; MMP-8 vs. MMP-9 corr. 0.55 p?=?0.009). The results from this study highlight the high degree of variability that can be observed in the pressure ulcer environment. This further suggests that a combination of biomarkers will be required for making accurate diagnostic assessments of chronic wounds. This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - The Thermage system is a radiofrequency (RF) device designed to treat human skin. The Thermage ThermaCool TC? is a noninvasive, nonablative, nonlaser system that combines cryogen cooling and radiofrequency (RF) energy to volumetrically heat dermal and subdermal tissue. Thermage treatment causes collagen contraction resulting in immediate skin tightening. It has also been clinically shown to tighten skin over time. This long-term tightening effect is believed to result from the body?s wound healing response. We performed studies in a juvenile pig to characterize the wound healing response after ThermaCool treatment in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular events resulting from treatment. Histological markers of the wound healing process were examined over a 1-month period. Collagen gene expression was examined by quantitative PCR. Macrophages and mast cells are important inflammatory cell types that stimulate fibroblast recruitment, collagen synthesis and blood vessel growth. Three to 5 days following treatment, macrophages and mast cells were present in the dermis. By 28 days, both increased dermal blood vessel density and epidermal thickness was observed. Collagen I and collagen III genes were expressed at elevated levels by 21 days posttreatment. ThermaCool? treatment stimulates dermal remodeling by initiating a wound-healing response. This study demonstrates that thermage treatment results in the recruitment of important cellular mediators of wound healing and increased collagen synthesis in an animal model. These events are presumed to be responsible for dermal remodeling and skin tightening over time in human subjects. Because the Thermage device noninvasively delivers heat energy, it may be a unique tool for the examination of aseptic thermally induced wound models.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest. This work received support from NIH GM 58530 and NIH GM 20298.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in both developing and developed countries. Biomarkers for stroke and its outcome can greatly facilitate early detection and management of the disease. miRNAs have been explored for their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and brain injury in ischaemic stroke. A substantial body of evidence suggests that miRNAs play key roles in numerous cellular changes following ischaemic stroke including mitochondrial dysfunction, energy failure, cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, activation of glial cells, increased intracellular calcium levels inflammatory responses and disruption of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). In addition, targeting specific miRNAs, therapeutic modulation of brain injury and apoptosis can also be achieved. Therefore, the current review has been compiled within an aim to give an overview of the developments exploiting miRNAs at different stages of stroke as prognostic, diagnostic, protective and therapeutic biomarkers.

AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Introduction:? Currently freeze-dried, gamma-sterilized, or glycerol-preserved amniotic membranes are widely used. However, it is not clear whether this devitalized state is the optimal application form. Therefore within this study the ideal condition for midterm storage of human amniotic membranes was assessed to ensure the availability of vital amniotic membranes, in particular for burn wounds. Methods and Materials:? For this purpose mothers were serologically tested and term placentae were collected and washed. After the amniotic membrane was peeled off and further washed, biopsies were taken for microbiological testing and various storage experiments (different media and temperatures). ?? cell culture medium, 37?°C ?? glycerol, 4?°C ?? 10% DMSO, ?80?°C Viability of fresh and stored amniotic membranes was determined with the MTT-based EZ4U- Assay (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Results and Discussion:? Best results were obtained while storing the membranes in cell culture medium at 37?°C, whereas storage in glycerol at 4?°C resulted in cell death within the first 4 days. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the viability of amniotic membrane under different storage conditions. The influence on wound healing is currently under investigation.

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.
