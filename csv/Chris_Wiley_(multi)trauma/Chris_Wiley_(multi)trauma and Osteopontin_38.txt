AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - The role of proteases in chronic wounds has been the subject of many investigations in recent years. These studies have reported biochemical differences between chronic and acute wound fluids and have shown that elevated levels of proteases, in particular the matrix metalloproteinases are abundant in chronic wounds. While this has led to the hypothesis that the chronic wound environment is hostile and not conducive to wound repair, it is still unknown whether this is due to a direct or indirect defect in protease regulation or their inhibitors. We hypothesize that an excess of proteases, specifically the serine proteases present in chronic wounds, are primarily responsible for this hostile wound environment. These proteases degrade endogenous growth factors, reducing their efficacy and delaying healing. In this study, fluid and tissue from chronic and acute wounds were collected over a 24-hour period. Using ELISA, samples were assessed for protease activity (specifically elastase and typsin-like enzymes), their inhibitors and growth factors. Our results show that serine proteases, predominantly elastase, were significantly elevated in the chronic wound fluids. The serpins designed to control these proteases were not up-regulated when compared to the acute controls, resulting in excessive proteolytic activity. An increase in serine protease production without an increase in their serpins is thought to result in a reduction in growth factors, an effect, which was also observed in the chronic wound samples. This work indicates that there is an imbalance in the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme, due to an up regulation of protease production in chronic wounds. We also conclude that misregulation of serine proteases may be responsible for the observed excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix and growth factors in these chronic wounds.

AB  - Clinically the outcome of pressure ulcers is predicted by the severity/stage of the ulcer, patient health and health care options. These factors, however, cannot be used to accurately evaluate the prognosis and healing in these ulcers, thus delaying any required change in the treatment plan. Techniques are needed that can help in the assessment of healing and improve the clinical management of these ulcers. Studies of tissue health such as angiogenesis, by measuring blood flow in the ulcer at different time points, has been examined as a way to evaluate the state of healing ulcers. Although the Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager (LDPI) has been used to assess various wounds, there is a need to validate it as a predictor of wound healing. The standard clinical outcome parameter for skin wounds has been time to heal. To validate the LDPI as predictor of healing, however, a measure that gives periodic feedback such as healing rate is a more useful outcome measure. The goal of this study therefore was to determine a protocol for the LDPI and evaluate its ability to predict healing in pressure ulcers. Previous studies have indicated that perfusion values obtained after heat stress may reflect the blood flow more accurately than absolute perfusion values. It was hypothesized that the difference in the blood perfusion after heat provocation is expected to correlate with the healing rate. The selected heat provocation (increase of 20?°F) was evaluated on five spinal cord injured pressure ulcer patients. The LDPI assessment and healing rate measurements were done weekly for 5 weeks. Preliminary results suggest a relationship between the difference in the perfusion and the healing rate for the following week. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact relationship. This tool has the potential to play a critical role in the clinical management of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Objective:? The use of fibrin as an injectable cell carrier to repair osseous defects has been reported with varying degrees of success. This study investigates fibrin formulational dependence on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) proliferation and differentiation. Methods:? 2???104?hMSCs (Bio Whittaker) per fibrin gel were suspended in fibrin formulations with varied fibrinogen (5, 17, 50?mg/ml) and thrombin (250, 167, and 1?U/ml); and cultured in 24-well plates at 37?°C, 5% CO2 for up to 2 weeks. Formulational influences on clot structure were evaluated by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. hMSC proliferation and morphology were monitored by calcein staining. hMSC-conditioned medium was assayed using zymography (MMP-2, MMP-9), fibrin overlay (uPA), and reverse overlay (PAI-1) to examine the effect of fibrin formulation on protease activity and fibrinolysis. Results/Discussions:? Confocal and electron microscopy revealed formulation dependence on three-dimensional fibrin structure, with lower fibrinogen concentrations yielding more open, homogeneous microstructures. Although hMSCs are viable in all fibrin formulations investigated, proliferation rates varied with fibrinogen concentration, with lower fibrinogen concentrations (i.e., 5?mg/ml) promoting greater hMSC proliferation. Protease levels and activities were sensitive to culture time and fibrin formulation. PAI-1 expression was elevated in hMSCs inside fibrin gels, while uPA activity was low. Both the pro and active form of MMP2 was detected by gelatin zymography, but no MMP9 was detected. This study suggests that fibrinogen:thrombin ratio can significantly influence hMSCs proliferation and interactions, and should be carefully considered when developing formulations for optimal delivery of hMSCs.

AB  - It is expected that by 2030, 20% of the American population will be over 65 years of age. Forty percent of Americans are expected to die in nursing homes in the near future. Pressure ulcer prevalence rates of 13% are reported at long-term care units but healing rates are infrequently published from these settings. Current wound protocols fail to consider patients goals of care. The possibility that a wound will not heal is rarely communicated to the patient or family. Palliative care focuses on the relief of suffering and improvement in the quality of life. It can be the sole focus of care or can be delivered parallel to aggressive curative treatments. This presentation describes a case history of an unfortunate 40-year-old patient suffering from multiple sclerosis who developed a stage 4 pressure ulcer during a pregnancy. Postpartum, the patient underwent flap coverage of the wound. Her MS worsened, the flap broke down and a family conference resulted in the decision to provide palliative wound care and involve hospice. Wound care continued with a silver impregnated absorptive dressings and ultraviolet light therapy to control bioburden, diminish odor and dressing frequency, which improved quality of life. Palliative wound protocols will be reviewed along with details of the above-mentioned case. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Aim:? To determine the viability/effects of incorporating Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT )/V.A.C.? Therapy as an adjunct in the treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum. Material and Methods:? A 74-year-old white female presented with clinical evidence of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). The wound exhibited pathergy and therefore aggressive debridement remained contraindicated. The patient applied topical Elidel cream to the periwound. With meticulous wound management, the lesion remained free of infection. Clinicians utilized various systemic treatment regimes including Minocycline 100?mg twice daily, Dapsone 50?mg daily, Cyclosporine 150?mg twice daily, and ultimately Infliximab 5?mg/kg every 2 months. The latter drug created a significant positive response; however, the wound continued to ?wax and wane.? Researchers began NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy to facilitate granulation tissue, epithelization, and ultimate wound closure. Results:? The researchers observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue with the addition of NPWT/V.A.C.? therapy. Conclusions:? NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy appears to augment healing in a patient with Pyoderma Gangrenosum and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgments:? KCI?, San Antonio, TX

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

AB  - Hypothesis:? The use of Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy will stimulate the development of angiogenesis in the subjacent tissues underlying and surrounding the wound base to a greater degree than can be achieved with standard wound healing efforts. Study Background:? The presence of tissue ischemia and hypoxia due to compromised arterial blood flow is a primary factor compromising wound healing. Wounds that are compromised by impaired angiogenesis will have poor blood supply and are unlikely to progress through the stages of healing in an orderly and timely fashion. The VAC is a subatmospheric pressure system utilizing medical grade polyurethane foam wound dressing that is fitted at the bedside to the appropriate size for each patient?s wound, and then covered with an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. The VAC enhances wound healing by stimulating granulation tissue. The etiology of this granulation is thought to be increased blood flow to the wound base and stimulation of angiogenesis, but the physiologic tissue changes due to VAC therapy that lead to the development of angiogenesis has not been proven or documented. A recent clinical observation demonstrated angiographic evidence of subadjacent angiogenesis in a patient with a wound that was managed successfully with VAC therapy. However, to date no randomized controlled trials have been performed to document wound angiogenesis. We propose that subatmospheric pressure dressings applied to lower extremity ulcers will promote angiogenesis more effectively than moist wound therapy dressings.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars are a resultant of a fibroproliferative disorder observed at the time of the wound healing of large surface, like burns. In normal wound, the process of healing begins with the invasion in the wound of microvascular cells and by the migration of myofibroblasts to form the granulation tissue. There, myofibroblasts play an important role since they synthesize the extracellular matrix and are responsible for the contraction of the wound. At the end of the healing process, the myofibroblasts disappear by apoptosis via unknown stimuli. In the case of hypertrophics scars, there is persistence of a high density of cells and collagen in comparison with normal granulation tissue. Scientists associate this disorder with a problem in the regulation of apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that endothelial cells play an important role in the persistence of myofibroblasts in wound healing. We have compared the apoptotic rates of human myofibroblasts from normal wounds (Wmyo) with those from hypertrophic scars (Hmyo) when exposed with supernatants from microvascular cells isolated from normal skins (CEMV) or hypertrophic scars (CEMVH). The first results showed a significative reduction of apoptosis for Hmyo while Wmyo were not found to respond to the microvascular supernatant. There were, however, no difference in the apoptotic rates of both populations of cells when exposed to CEMV or CEMVH supernatants. These results suggest that endothelial cells secrete one or many factors that inhibit Hmyo apoptosis, thus preventing the disappearance of those cells and inducing the formation of hypertrophic scars. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the formation of hypertrophic scars will open the way to new treatments. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Introduction:? Currently freeze-dried, gamma-sterilized, or glycerol-preserved amniotic membranes are widely used. However, it is not clear whether this devitalized state is the optimal application form. Therefore within this study the ideal condition for midterm storage of human amniotic membranes was assessed to ensure the availability of vital amniotic membranes, in particular for burn wounds. Methods and Materials:? For this purpose mothers were serologically tested and term placentae were collected and washed. After the amniotic membrane was peeled off and further washed, biopsies were taken for microbiological testing and various storage experiments (different media and temperatures). ?? cell culture medium, 37?°C ?? glycerol, 4?°C ?? 10% DMSO, ?80?°C Viability of fresh and stored amniotic membranes was determined with the MTT-based EZ4U- Assay (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Results and Discussion:? Best results were obtained while storing the membranes in cell culture medium at 37?°C, whereas storage in glycerol at 4?°C resulted in cell death within the first 4 days. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the viability of amniotic membrane under different storage conditions. The influence on wound healing is currently under investigation.

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Introduction:? Healing wounds are characterized by high lactate levels. In the past, the shift to an anaerobic energy metabolism was thought to be the main source for increased lactate concentration. Lactate is also generated by leukocytic NADPH-linked oxygenase using oxygen and glucose as one of its substrates, a mechanism called aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen therapy by increasing oxygen availability enhances wound lactate production by aerobic glycolysis. Material and methods:? Four wire mesh wound cylinders (n?=?142) were implanted underneath the dorsal skin in each of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (312?±?11?g). Animals were randomized to two groups: The first group (n?=?18) received 100% oxygen with 2.1 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for a total of 7 days. The second group (n?=?18) was treated with 21% oxygen with 1 ATA for the same time schedule. Hyperbaric treatments were administered in a hyperbaric chamber designed for small animals. Wound fluid from the cylinders was aspirated between the two treatment cycles at day 2 and 5 and analysed for lactate using a lactate analyser. Additionally, at day 10 (after 2 days of treatment with 21% oxygen in 1 ATA in both groups) lactate concentrations in wound fluid were measured again. Data are expressed as mean?±?SD. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results:? Wound lactate concentration was significantly increased both in control and hyperbaric rats at day 5 and day 10 compared to day 2 (controls 4.5?±?1, 5.9?±?0.8, 6.7?±?1.2?mmol/l; p?=?0.04 and hyperbarics 4.4?±?1.2, 6.5?±?1.3, 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). At day 2 and day 5 there was no significant difference in lactate levels between control and hyperbaric rats. However, at day 10 lactate concentration was significantly higher in the hyperbaric group compared to the control group (6.7?±?1.2 vs. 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). Conclusion:? This investigation provides evidence for the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen action since lactate is known to stimulate collagen production and angiogenesis.

AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.
