AB  - Advocate Christ hospital is a 650-bed, level-one tertiary-care center that created a comprehensive wound care program in November 1998. Over the first 3 years of the program there were over 140 admissions per year directly from the wound center along with numerous hospital to hospital transfers for complex wound management. Prevalence rates therefore increased linearly over this time frame. The wound team calculated a system-wide (eight hospitals) spend of $2.1 million per year for specialty rental beds. Incidence rates for the system were at, but not lower than, national levels despite the high cost incurred. A $1.3 million capital purchase for KCI atmos-air 9000? mattresses resulted in the complete replacement of all medical surgical beds in all eight hospitals. An internal prevalence and incidence team was created and data were collected both at the hospital and system-wide level on a quarterly basis. Hospital and system incidence rates fell to or below 7%(targeted goal) and the entire project will achieve a return on investment in 18 months. Data to be presented include prevalence and incidence results, rental bed costs pre- and postbed purchase, and a detailed review of the process of creating an electronic prevalence and incidence tracking system.

AB  - Previous wound healing studies have attempted to improve angiogenesis (new blood vessel ingrowth). Recent studies suggest, however, that revascularization of wounds may also be accomplished by vasculogenesis: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow and blood that home to sites of tissue damage and form new blood vessels. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic and topical transplantation of EPCs for wound healing in an in vivo rabbit model. It was hypothesized that applying cells topically through an EPC-seeded albumin scaffold may promote revascularization from inside the wound versus only from the periphery. Further, it was hypothesized that combining topical and systemic transplantation of EPCs may increase vessel formation from both directions. Full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of New Zealand White rabbits. Wounds were treated with either an EPC-seeded scaffold, nonseeded scaffold, or no treatment (control). Additionally, half of the animals were given systemic injections of EPCs. Digital pictures were taken weekly until sacrifice to determine healing rates. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging scans were used to measure changes in blood perfusion during healing. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 4 weeks; wounds were excised and prepared for histological examination. Histomorphometry was used to calculate epithelialization and contraction rates, as well as the volume fraction of cell nuclei and blood vessels. Preliminary results suggest that animals that received systemic transplantations of EPCs had higher overall healing rates than those with no injection. Systemic transplantation alone improved healing over the control by the end of 2 weeks. When combined with a topical scaffold (both EPC-seeded and nonseeded), systemically injected cells showed improved healing by the end of the first week. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Electroporation of cells leads to breakdown of the ion gradients and release of intracellular contents. This triggers edema, which raises the local hydration level over its physiological value. Therefore, the state of water in an injured tissue is changed and the compartmentalization and dynamics of the spin populations during magnetic relaxation differ from healthy tissue. Methods:? We measured spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin density (M0) parameters of water protons in electroporated rat muscles by using a 4.7-Tesla GE/Bruker Omega scanner. The rats were sacrificed 3?h postshock and extensor digitorum longus, soleus and biceps femoris muscles were collected. Contralateral muscle samples served as controls. T2 and M0 were obtained using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill methods. Following MR imaging the water content in the tissue samples was measured. To infer T2 from the value corresponding to bulk water we also measured T2 of lysozyme and ribonuclease(1?mM) solutions (10?mM phosphate buffer at pH?=?7.0) as a function of protein concentration. Results:? T2 values were determined by fitting the signal amplitude from the echoes to the decay time. We obtained for deionized distilled water T2?=?614?±?31?ms, for lysozyme, T2?=?478?±?25?ms and for ribonuclease A, T2?=?423?±?22?ms. The analysis of T2-weighted MR images in rat muscles showed a 25?75% increase of the water T2 relaxation time in the three different muscle samples, of which soleus muscle showed the largest increase of 75%, from ?40?ms in controls to ?70?ms in injured muscles. Conclusions:? Electroporation leads to increased in T2, which may have two components. First, the accumulated water adds extra hydration layers to proteins. Second, the dynamics of water molecules may be altered as a result of development of the structural damage due to activation of degradative processes in the tissue.

AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

For 2 years the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies treating the wound with regular debridements and Regranex therapy. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91 the patient developed osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapies were initiated. Current Clinical Approach:? In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3?ml/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLOSD) as the patient ambulated. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3????4? island dressing. Patient Outcomes:? After 3 weeks of continuous oxygen and antibiotic therapies the patient was able to ambulate without pain. The planned amputation was canceled. The wound bed was characterized by new granulation tissue and reepithelialization. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 30 days, but the tiny, 2 ounce oxygen therapy device was continued until full wound closure 11 weeks later. The wound remained closed for 36 months, the remainder of the patient?s life. Conclusions:? The effectiveness of the antibiotics in this patient as well as other oxygen-sensitive wound healing processes may have been potentiated and enhanced by the continuous availability of oxygen at this dosage. Further carefully controlled studies of transdermal sustained oxygen delivery for the treatment of chronic wounds with osteomyelitis are needed to clarify the underlying scientific mechanisms of this beneficial effect. The support of Ogenix Corporation in supplying EpiFLOSD for this project is appreciated.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.

AB  - Background:? Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate the healing of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcerations. It appears to function as cell-based therapy (e.g., delivering growth factors), rather than as a true graft. Given this mechanism of action, its use could be expanded to areas in which traditional skin grafting is not routinely employed. Methods:? A 64-year-old wheel-chairbound Caucasian male presented to the wound clinic with a grade III left trochanteric pressure ulcer which had been present since 1976. He had been seen by numerous physicians and treated with debridement, topical antimicrobials, negative pressure therapy, growth factors, and a variety of dressings. We spent several months preparing the wound bed: maintaining adequate moisture balance, performing serial debridement, utilizing offloading surfaces and reducing the bacterial burden. His nutritional status was optimized. The wound bed developed a healthy granulating base but failed to close. Results:? A single unit of Apligraf was meshed at a 1:1.5 ratio and applied to the wound. It was fixed in place using a nonstick silicone dressing, foam, and a self-adhesive covering. The dressing was changed weekly in the wound clinic. The initial response was a decrease in wound depth followed by steady epithelialization. Complete closure occurred 17 weeks after grafting. The wound has not recurred. Conclusion:? This single case study suggests that bilayered cell therapy may have application in difficult wounds, such as pressure ulcerations. Further study into the efficacy of Apligraf in pressure ulcerations is ongoing.

AB  - In persons with venous ulcers and an absence of arterial disease, high compression as exemplified by the four layer bandage (Profore) has been demonstrated to be effective by a meta-analysis of existing studies. Despite optimized compression, some venous ulcers do not heal at the expected rate and persistent inflammation or infection may delay or prevent healing. We report the results of a case series that demonstrates an ionized silver dressing with prolonged release of nanocrystalline crystals (Acticoat 7) can decrease bacterial burden and accelerate healing in venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under a four layer bandage (Profore) for 12 weeks, or until healing. The primary efficacy objective measured the effect of the silver dressing on the wound microflora. Biopsies of the wounds were taken at baseline and after treatment with the silver dressing (Acticoat 7) and were analyzed for the bacterial species and number of bacteria present. In addition, serum silver levels were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and week 12 or final assessment. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. Of those patients who did not heal, 4 had more than a 94% reduction in wound area by the end of the 12-week study period. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase (p?=?0.054) in serum silver concentration during the treatment period. At baseline, prior to the silver dressing treatment (Acticoat 7), the median silver concentration was 0.3??g/L (range: 0.20?1.90??g/L). The median within patient change from baseline serum silver concentration was an increase of 0.15??g/L (range: ?0.3?2.8??g/L). Although this small increase was observed it was not considered clinically significant. This study illustrates the use of prolonged release nanocrystalline silver dressing to decrease the bacterial burden of chronic venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate.

AB  - Often chronic wounds have an increased bacterial burden that can impair healing without the classical clinical signs of infection. Silver dressings may provide an alternative topical method to control bacterial burden. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2?4 weeks therapy with the Silver Containing Hydrofiber? dressing on quantitative bacterial burden and clinical improvement in chronic wounds not healing at the expected rate. This was a single centre, four-armed study which included a total of 30 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and miscellaneous wounds that did not fit into any of the above categories. Patients had a baseline quantitative bacterial biopsy and this was repeated at weeks 2 to 4. The wound size was recorded along with a semi quantitative estimate of exudate and the periwound temperatures. Repeat measurements were performed at the follow-up visits and the decrease in wound size calculated. The underlying cause of the ulceration was be treated and corrected. This was followed by application of silver containing hydrofiber? dressing. There was a significant delay in healing of the leg ulcers associated with increased bacterial burden in the quantitative biopsy bacterial burden results at week 0 and healing at week 2. (p?=?0.01). Other subgroups had a similar association that did not reach statistical significance. The presence of an increased exudate in the leg ulcers at week two was associated with delayed healing at week 4 (p?=?0.05). There was also a significant increase in skin surface temperature of the surrounding skin with an increased quantitative bacterial biopsy of the deep wound compartment for venous, diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers with p values of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively. There was no significant decrease in exudate or increased healing of the wounds with the application of the silver hydrofiber dressing in this difficult to heal population. The population studied in this case series had increased bacterial burden in the deep compartment as measured with increased exudate and or an increased temperature of the periwound skin. These patients have an increased bacterial burden in the deep wound compartment that does not respond to topical ionized silver in the dressing studied.

AB  - How wound dressings may act locally to aid chronic wound healing is poorly understood. Along with an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and the realization that these ulcers exhibit a high degree of inflammation, models have been developed linking the disease etiology and the visible ulcer. Furthermore, these models have suggested ways in which present therapeutic regimens, such as compression, aid healing. However, little focus has been placed on understanding how locally applied wound dressings aid in the overall healing response in the context of elevated inflammation. Here, we propose that if wound dressings have the correct combination of novel materials and physical characteristics they may provide effective management of the damaging local factors (i.e., proteinases and/or bacteria), thereby promoting a local environment supportive of healing. For example, the management of damaging wound exudates, limiting its exposure to the wound bed and surrounding skin, reduces the irritant effects of these exudates, leading to a reduction in the localized stimulation of inflammation. A better understanding of local environment and wound dressing interactions will help in the development of more effective wound dressings in the future.
