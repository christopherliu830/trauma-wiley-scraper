AB  - Abstract Several attempts have been made to engineer a viable three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue equivalent using conventional tissue engineering strategies, but with limited clinical success. Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.

AB  - Abstract: In toxicology studies, drug-induced arterial injury in laboratory animals continues to be a pressing issue of concern, particularly to those engaged in the discovery and development of novel therapies intended for human use. The concern is justifiably magnified because, currently, there is no unequivocal biochemical marker of arterial injury and/or toxicity in animals or man. Therefore, in laboratory animals used for toxicology studies a precise description of arterial lesions in terms of location, distribution and morphologic character is necessary so that a correlation can be drawn between structural damage and derangement of specific cardiovascular functions. The critical nature of the latter cannot be over-emphasized because this will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of toxicity, the pathogenesis of the lesion and assessment of human risk. However, in the decision making process, utilization of pattern recognition must be supported by rigorous scientific investigations aimed at establishing a link, where possible, between the deranged cardiovascular function and alterations in cellular, biochemical and molecular events. Conceivably, engagement of the molecular pharmacology target initiates a series of interactive cascades among cellular and non-cellular arterial components that culminate in organ damage. Therefore, any investigative mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the initiation and development of arterial lesions in laboratory animals must make a conscientious attempt to identify and characterize the molecular target of toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Abstract Pulp stones are a frequent finding on bitewing and periapical radiographs but receive relatively little attention in textbooks. A review of the literature was therefore performed, initially using the PubMed database and beginning the search with ?pulp calcifications? and ?pulp stones?. Each term provided more than 400 references, many of which related to pulp calcification in general rather than pulp stones, and focussed largely on the problems these changes presented to clinicians. A manual search using references from this source was carried out. Contemporary textbooks in endodontology were also consulted, and an historic perspective gained from a number of older books and references. The factors involved in the development of the pulp stones are largely unknown. Further research may determine the reasons for their formation, but with current endodontic instruments and techniques this is unlikely to alter their relevance to clinicians.

AB  - Introduction.? It is now accepted that progenitor/stem cells reside within the post-natal dental pulp. Studies have identified several niches of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, known as dental pulp stem cells, which have a high proliferative potential for self-renewal. These progenitor stem cells are now recognized as being vital to the dentine regeneration process following injury. Understanding the nature of these progenitor/stem cell populations in the pulp is important in determining their potentialities and development of isolation or recruitment strategies for use in regeneration and tissue engineering. Characterization of these cells, and determination of their potentialities in terms of specificity of regenerative response, may help direct new clinical treatment modalities. Such novel treatments may involve controlled direct recruitment of the cells in situ and possible seeding of stem cells at sites of injury for regeneration or use of the stem cells with appropriate scaffolds for tissue engineering solutions. Such approaches may provide an innovative and novel biologically based new generation of clinical materials and/or treatments for dental disease. Aim.? This study aimed to review the body of knowledge relating to stem cells and to consider the possibility of these cell populations, and related technology, in future clinical applications.

AB  - The gradual accumulation of collagen and associated proteins of the extracellular matrix is a crucial myopathological parameter of many neuromuscular disorders. Progressive tissue damage and fibrosis play a key pathobiochemical role in the dysregulation of contractile functions and often correlates with poor motor outcome in muscular dystrophies. Following a brief introduction into the role of the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscles, we review here the proteomic profiling of myofibrosis and its intrinsic role in X-linked muscular dystrophy. Although Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily a disease of the membrane cytoskeleton, one of its most striking histopathological features is a hyperactive connective tissue and tissue scarring. We outline the identification of novel factors involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix in muscular dystrophy, such as matricellular proteins. The establishment of novel proteomic markers will be helpful in improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring in relation to fibrotic substitution of contractile tissue. In the future, the prevention of fibrosis will be crucial for providing optimum conditions to apply novel pharmacological treatments, as well as establish cell-based approaches or gene therapeutic interventions. The elimination of secondary abnormalities in the matrisome promises to reduce tissue scarring and the loss of skeletal muscle elasticity.
