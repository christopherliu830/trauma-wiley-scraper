AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Purpose:? The purpose of this study was to determine the current use of wet-to-dry dressings as the principal wound care modality ordered by health care providers. In addition, this study describes the types of wounds wet-to-dry dressings are currently used for, the specialty of health care providers most likely to order these dressings, and associated data that indicates whether or not the clinical condition of the wound warrants the use of wet-to-dry dressing for mechanical debridement. Method:? This descriptive study involved a retrospective chart review of 202 home health and HMO case managed patients with open wounds One hundred and two HMO charts were reviewed; only 74 had sufficient data documented. One hundred and sixty-one home health charts were reviewed; only 128 were appropriate for data collection (closed incisions, drainage tubes, ostomies, and those charts where more than six items on the data collection sheet were not documented in the chart, were not used). The data was analyzed using SPSS. Findings:? This study suggests that the current use of wet-to-dry dressings is over 41% of all principal wound care modalities, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). The majority of wet-to-dry dressings ordered are for surgical wounds (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Furthermore, this study suggests that general surgeons are most likely to order wet-to-dry dressings (38%). Data also indicated that in over 78.6% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings, mechanical debridement was not indicated (the percent of granulating tissue in the wound bed was?>?75%). In only 3.5% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings was mechanical debridement possibly indicated by the amount of nonviable tissue in the wound bed. Discussion:? Clinicians need to be involved in research that will lead to evidenced based clinical practice and standardized wound care. The scientific literature suggests that wet-to-dry dressings are not evidenced based, but are detrimental to the granulating wound bed, painful, costly, and one of the least effective methods of debridement available today.

AB  - Induced organ regeneration is de novo synthesis of a physiological, or nearly physiological, organ at the same anatomical site as the organ that is being replaced. Regeneration of skin, peripheral nerves, and the conjunctiva have been accomplished using nothing more than biologically active scaffolds (regeneration templates) seeded with epithelial cells; devices for regeneration of the first two organs are in clinical use. Templates appear to function by blocking contraction well as by acting as temporary configurational guides for synthesis of new stroma that resembles that of the organ under replacement. The combined evidence supports a theory which predicts that selective blocking of the adult healing response uncovers part, at least, of the latent fetal response to injury and, in the presence of the appropriate scaffold, eventually leads to organ regeneration. An independent theory suggests that loss of regenerative potential, which is observed during the mammalian fetal-adult transition, is associated with simultaneous acquisition of individual immunocompetence.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.

AB  - Background:? Previously, we showed in a human forearm biopsy model of wound healing that acute healing dynamics can be characterized at the clinical and genetic level. Growth factor application by recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) accelerates the velocity of wound healing and modulates gene expression in wounds. To profile the function, structure, and genomics of acute healing, the human results were compared with a murine model of acute circular and incisional wounds. Methods:? Full thickness 8?mm circular skin wounds and linear surgical incisional wounds were created in 6-week-old Balb-C mice and recombinant angiogenic growth factors (PDGF vs. PDGF/FGF2/VEGF) were administered topically to wounds daily. Velocity of healing and time to complete closure were determined by digital planimetry. Tissue was examined for histopathological, morphometric, functional, and gene expression parameters, and compared to human results. Results:? Acute healing velocity can be quantified and compared in human and murine models. Linear incisions heal in distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and gene expression patterns compared to circular wounds. The cellular profile shows differences between wound types. Topical PDGF accelerates angiogenesis and time to complete acute healing. Human and murine gene expression was correlated. Results will be presented. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan component of normal dermis and a major component of the matrix synthesized during wound healing. Previous studies have shown that uncrosslinked HA is rapidly degraded and cleared in vivo, limiting its clinical utility. We have used a novel HA hydrogel scaffold that is crosslinked for prolonged bioavailability. It has a porous interior and a smooth surface. This scaffold can also be fabricated with collagen and linked to proteins or DNA to direct cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that this novel HA formulation might itself improve wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Purpose:? The present study explored the effects of a crosslinked HA hydrogel on wound healing. Methods:? Using an established model of wound healing, four 7?mm punch wounds were made on each ear of New Zealand rabbits. Each wound was immediately treated with topical application of one of the following: HA hydrogel (n?=?26), HA/collagen hydrogel (n?=?27), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(n?=?16). Wounds were harvested on day 8 for histologic evaluation. Sections were examined for epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth into wounds. Results:? HA- and HA/collagen-treated wounds showed statistically significant increases in epithelial (p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.007, respectively) and granulation tissue ingrowth (p?=?0.004 and p?=?0.01, respectively) when compared to PBS-treated controls. Conclusions:? In the rabbit ear ulcer model, the application of crosslinked HA and HA/collagen hydrogels accelerated wound healing as measured by epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth.

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - The potential to lower destructively high levels of elastase found in chronic wounds with oleic acid-treated cotton wound dressings was assessed and compared with two types of oleic acid-treated occlusive wound dressings. The ability of albumin to bind oleic acid and transfer elastase inhibitory activity from the dressing material to elastase in solution was examined. Cotton, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid wound dressings were treated with oleic acid and tested for their ability to lower elastase activity. Oleic acid?treated cotton gauzes, hydrogels, and hydrocolloid dressings were found to release oleic acid in the presence of albumin in sufficient quantities to inhibit elastase activity. The order of elastase lowering activity with the three oleic acid-formulated wound dressings was cotton gauze?>?hydrogel?>?hydrocolloid. Elastase inhibition by oleic acid displaced from gauze followed a dose response profile. In contrast Cathepsin G, when displaced by albumin, was inhibited within a narrow range of oleic acid formulations. The effect of albumin levels representative of the chronic wound on displacement of oleic acid was determined. Solubilization of cotton bound oleic acid by albumin was found to be most effective at 4% albumin. However, there was sufficient solubilization of oleic acid at the 2% albumin levels found in chronic wound fluid to achieve a significant elastase-lowering effect. Albumin promoted solubilization of oleic acid from cotton with a solubility threshold of 27?mg/g cotton gauze. Equivalent lowering of elastase activity was found with 1%, 2%, and 4% albumin concentrations with oleic acid on cotton at 128?mg oleic acid/gram of cotton.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.

AB  - SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine), a matricellular glycoprotein, modulates the interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix. Studies in null-mice revealed a role of SPARC in wound healing. Here we examined the effect of SPARC in a skin-humanized mouse wound healing model. This model is based in the regeneration of human skin onto the back of nude mice by transplantation of a dermo-epidermal equivalent. The regenerated human skin was excisionally wounded with biopsy punches. At the moment of wounding an adenoviral vector encoding the cDNA for SPARC was intradermally injected. We are currently assessing the effects of in vivo gene transfer of SPARC at the wound site in the healing process. Criticals events of wound healing including reepithelialization, regeneration of dermoepidermal junction and dermal remodeling were studied at different time points postwounding.

AB  - Hypertrophic scarring is a pathological process characterized by a fibroblastic hyperproliferation and by an excess of deposition of extracellular matrix components. Hypothesis of abnormalities in epidermal-dermal cross talk has been laid down to explain this pathology. To check this affirmation, we used a tissue-engineered model of self-assembly reconstructed skin in order to mimic interactions between dermal and epidermal cells in normal or pathological skin. We performed those skin equivalents with three dermal cell types : normal wound (Wmyo) or hypertrophic wound (Hmyo) myofibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts (Fb). Epidermis was reconstructed with normal skin keratinocytes (NK), hypertrophic scars keratinocytes (HK), or without any keratinocytes. In the absence of epidermis, Hmyo formed a thicker dermis than Wmyo. When seeded with NK, the dermal thickness of Hmyo and Fb dermis was significantly reduced while that of Wmyo was increased. However, the presence of HK always induced thicker dermis formation than observed with NK. HK also increase the production of extracellular matrix and reduce its degradation in comparison with NK. In addition, HK have more influence on dermal cells proliferation than NK. In conclusion, HK may play a more important role on fibrosis development than NK. The keratinocytes have distinct secretory patterns depending on their skin source. Wmyo and Hmyo do not react the same way to the presence of keratinocytes. These observations strongly suggest that HK have a more important role on pathological fibrosis development by influencing dermal cells behavior. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an ubiquitous enzyme produced by different cell types. Previous reports have demonstrated ALP induction by extracellular matrix, ascorbic acid or IL-6. Using histochemical techniques, we evaluated the ex vivo activity of ALP in incisional and excisional acute wounds, chronic wounds, and keloids in animal and human models. We also compared in situ ALP activity with type I/III collagen levels using histological methods (Herovici technique). Results demonstrated that 1) during the first stage of acute wound healing the increase in ALP activity precedes high levels of type III collagen, meanwhile type I collagen diminishes. When ALP activity disappears, the proportion of type I/III collagen returns to normal. 2) ALP activity is almost null in chronic wounds, which are characterized by thick type I collagen fibers and some type III collagen throughout the tissue. However, when the wound is treated, ALP activity rises to maximum levels together with type III collagen, but type I collagen is absent. 3) In keloids ALP activity is also absent; however when the scar is treated with a proinflammatory cytokine downmodulator (collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone) endogenous type I collagen diminishes, while type III collagen and ALP activity are increased. Based on the above results we suggest that ALP activity is an acute inflammation marker since the enzyme levels are increased in acute wounds but not in chronic inflammation processes. Nevertheless, when chronic lesions or scars are in the process of healing, the increase in ALP activity is clear. And as a result, we believe that treatments for chronic wounds or scars induce acute inflammation and consequently stimulate wound repair or fibrolysis. In conclusion, ALP activity is an important factor to be considered in acute and chronic wound repair and their healing process.

AB  - Introduction:? Accurate wound size measurement is vital to assessment of progressive healing. Lack of an accepted ?gold standard? is a major obstacle to assessment of any effective wound management regimen. Methodology:? Sixteen pelvic region pressure ulcers were monitored weekly for 3 weeks. All wounds were stage III or IV, equally divided between sacral and ischial locations. Linear wound size was measured using the Decubitus Disposable Measuring Guide (DDMG). Wound size index was defined as the sum of the linear dimensions. Wound volume was determined by filling the covered wound cavity with fluid; the volume of saline required to fill the wound was a direct measure of wound volume. Results and Discussion:? Correlation between the two measurement methods was determined utilizing Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient. Wound size index decreased significantly (p?<?0.01) over the study period. Wound volume changes were nonsignificant. Closer evaluation of assessment methodology found missing wound volume data, due primarily to patient positioning difficulties. All missing data points were for ischial wounds. Wound absorption of measurement fluid and residual fluid in the wound prior to measurement could not be determined. Wound size index may be influenced by subjective evaluation of wound boundaries. Conclusion:? Wound size index significantly discriminated longitudinal changes in wound size, while volume measurements did not. Wound volume measurements have greater measurement errors than wound size index.

AB  - Acute wounds caused by the severe and extensive infection such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci or MRSA may be life-threatening in immunocompromised hosts such as steroid users or those with venostasis in the lower legs. The principle of the treatment is the removal of the primary pathogens, however, difficulties of the lower leg reconstruction remain due to the tissue loss and the deficiency of the circulation system after extensive soft tissue debridement. For 10 immediately-developing extensive lower extremity cases, artificial skin substitutes composed of dried bilayer membranes of outer silicone membrane and inner porcine-tendon derived collagen layer (Pelnac?, Gunze Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were immediately after extensive and meticulous debridement. While the skin substitute integrated into the wound bed for maximally 3 weeks, total 20 micrograms of the basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)(Trafermin?, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were applied by the 27-Gage syringe daily. The outer membranes were removed and thin partial thickness skin grafting (9?10/1,000 inches) was performed and wound healed uneventfully. The bFGF-treated skin texture was significantly softer compared to control by a durometer (Teclock?, GS-701N, Tokyo, Japan)(p?<?0.01), which was a measuring device elastic hard products such as rubbers and polymers. Reconstruction using the porcine-derived artificial skin substitute in the lower extremities after extensive debridement was safe, easy, and reproducible. The quality of the wounds with bFGF significantly improves the healed skin texture.

AB  - A Laser Speckle Perfusion Imaging (LSPI) system has been developed to achieve rapid, high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of tissue blood flow. This study was designed to evaluate LSPI for monitoring dermal blood flow during the wound healing process in a well-established porcine model. Full-thickness excisional wounds (2???2?cm) were created on the dorsal skin of 11 juvenile female red Duroc pigs. The skin wounds were imaged weekly with the LSPI system until day 49 postwounding. Blood flow values for the wounds were normalized using the values from the surrounding healthy skin to account for variations in systemic perfusion from one scan date to the next. An average normalized perfusion value was obtained from the scans of all animals for each time point. Wound perfusion at the time of reepithelialization reached ?165% of the surrounding skin (p?<?0.001). This elevation in wound perfusion slowly and steadily decreased over time, until day 49 postwounding, at which time the values returned to normal. This trend toward decreased wound perfusion over time has previously been reported in human burn wounds using the LSPI instrument. Further, the LSPI data from this study and from other human studies correlates well with data generated using the more widely established Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) technique. The faster scan time and higher resolution of the LSPI method provides a distinct clinical advantage, both in terms of patient comfort and for reliably matching perfusion characteristics to their associated anatomical features. The fast temporal response of the LSPI instrument could be used to monitor vascular responses to mechanical or pharmacological interventions to study dynamic vascular changes to damaged tissues. This study validates LSPI as a tool to measure blood flow in skin wounds and further supports the use of the juvenile female pig as a model of excisional wound healing, yielding results comparable to healing in humans.

AB  - Abstract The presence of skeletal anomalies in farmed teleost fish is currently a major problem in aquaculture, entailing economical, biological and ethical issues. The common occurrence of skeletal abnormalities in farmed fish and the absence of effective solutions for avoiding their onset or definitely culling out the affected individuals as early as possible from the productive cycle, highlight the need to improve our knowledge on the basic processes regulating fish skeletogenesis and skeletal tissues differentiation, modelling and remodelling. Severe skeletal anomalies may actually occur throughout the entire life cycle of fish, but their development often begins with slight aberrations of the internal elements. Comprehensive investigation efforts conducted on reared larvae and juveniles could provide a great contribution in filling the gap in knowledge, as skeletogenesis and skeletal tissue differentiation occur during these early life stages. The aim of this review is to provide a synthetic but comprehensive picture of the actual knowledge on the ontogeny, typologies and occurrence of skeletal anomalies, and on the proposed causative factors for their onset in larvae and juveniles of European farmed fish. The state-of-art of knowledge of these issues is analysed critically intending to individualize the main gaps of knowledge that require to be filled, in order to optimize the morphological quality of farmed juveniles.
