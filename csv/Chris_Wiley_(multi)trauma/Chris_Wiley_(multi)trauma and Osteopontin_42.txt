AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Chronic, nonhealing wounds are often observed in tissues with poor oxygen supply. Impaired reepithelialization is a hallmark of these wounds; however, the pathogenesis of the retarded reepithelialization in chronic, ischemic wounds remains poorly understood. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) is involved in both normal and hypoxic wound healing response and exogenous overexpression of Smad3, a TGF-beta signaling intermediate, has been known to accelerate reepithelialization. In a recent study, Ad-Smad3 injection in the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model showed enhanced reepithelialization and granulation tissue area suggesting a positive effect of Smad3 on wound healing. However, little is known about the role of Smad3 in the ischemic wound healing process. In this study we examined the effect of Smad3 in an ischemic wound model. Methods:? Ad-Smad3 or LacZ (108?pfu/wound) empty vector was injected in either ear of White New Zealand Rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, these ears were rendered ischemic using an established model and four 7-mm full-thickness punch wounds were made on each ear. Results:? Histological evaluation showed a highly significant increase in reepithelialization, epithelial ingrowth and percentage of epithelialization in Ad-Smad3 transfected wounds versus ischemic wounds transfected with LacZ-empty vector (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Our data confirm the enhancing effect of Smad3 on reepithelialization in an ischemic wound model. The deficiency in reepithelialization, as evident in chronic ischemic wounds, could thus be ameliorated by excess Smad3. Therapeutic interventions using overexpressed Smad3 may improve wound healing through accelerated epithelialization in chronic wounds.

AB  - Introduction:? Early excision and closure is standard for severe burn management. Cadaver skin is generally used as temporary coverage if autograft donor sites are inadequate. However, it is associated with an inherent risk of antigenicity and infection and has a limited shelf life and availability. Use of Integra?, a dermal substitute, is well established for postburn reconstruction, but its efficacy as primary coverage for severe burns it is not well documented. Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy of Integra? as an acute cover. Method:? Twenty children with >40 total body surface area (TBSA) burn, were randomized to be grafted with Integra? or with the autograft-allograft technique. Short-term outcome measures such as length of hospital stay, mortality, incidence of infection/sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic indexes were compared between and within groups before and after Integra?/graft application. Long-term outcome measures such as number of reconstructive procedures and blinded scar scoring were performed up to 2 years postinjury. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired t-test. Values are expressed as Mean?±?SEM and significance accepted at p?<?0.05. Results:? There were no significant differences between groups, in burn size (Controls 74?±?4% and Integra? 70?±?5%), mortality (Control 30%, Integra? 40%), length of hospital stay (Control 39?±?4 days, Integra? 41?±?4 days), and metabolic rates. In addition, there was no significant incidence of infection or sepsis in the Integra? group compared to controls. Long-term follow-up (Integra n?=?5, control n?=?5) revealed a significantly improved scar, in terms of height, thickness, vascularity, and maturity, in the Integra? group compared to the control group, at 12 months and 18?24 months postburn, (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Integra? can be safely used for immediate wound coverage in children with severe burns, with better functional and aesthetic outcomes up to 2 years postinjury.

AB  - A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study of diabetic foot ulcers was conducted to answer questions of safety and impact on wound healing of a noncontact ultrasound device. Standard of care included moist dressings, debridement, offloading, and adequacy vascular supply for both groups. Patients were randomized to receive a saline mist or 40?KHz ultrasound therapy delivered to the wound bed using the spray as the coupler. The study was 12 weeks in duration or until the wound closed. Sixty-six patients were entered with intent to treat. Fifty-five patients were evaluable and constitute the outcomes of the study. MIST therapy resulted in 42.3% rate of healing versus 14.3% for sham treated significant at 0.028 Chi square. Kaplan Meier survival plots resulted in p?<?0.0087?log rank and p?<?0.011 Wilcoxon. Rate of wound closure was 22% faster with MIST compared to sham treated patients. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to adverse events in any category (mild, moderate, or severe) MIST ultrasound therapy is a new, safe, novel FDA-cleared device that improves diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to standard of care. Details of the study will be presented. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by Celleration Inc. Eden Prairie, MN.

AB  - Introduction:? Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) expression is up-regulated during wound healing. CyC-AP deletion causes greater expression of TNFα, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 during cutaneous repair. Furthermore, CyC-AP is a mediator for fibronectin-fragment induced MMP-13 expression. In order to understand the effects of the deletion of CyC-AP at the cellular level, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways of CyC-AP null and wild-type mice during skin wound healing. Methods:? Two-month-old CyC-AP null or wild-type mice were anesthetized and two 0.6?cm diameter excisional skin wounds were made on the dorsum of each mouse. Wounds were collected up to 10 days after injury. Total protein was purified from each wound and the protein expression of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), integrin beta 1, ERK 1, ERK 2, p38, PCNA, and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) was analyzed by immunoblot. Results:? TNFα expression was higher in CyC-AP null mice in unwounded skin. However, the elevated TNFα in CyC-AP null wounds was lower compared to the wild-type mice. To further understand the relationship of CyC-AP and TNFα, TACE expression was examined. TACE expression was less in the skin of CyC-AP null mice compared to wild-type mice. Expression of p38 and PCNA increased while sm-actin decreased in both unwounded and wounded CyC-AP null skin compared to wild type. PCNA expression in CyC-AP null fibroblasts was also higher compared to wild type, supporting our in vivo observations. In addition, the expression of integrin beta 1 was lower during wound healing. Conclusion:? The increased PCNA and decreased sm-actin expression suggests that CyC-AP null fibroblasts have higher proliferation and lower differentiation rates compared to wild types. These effects might be regulated through the p38 signaling pathway, which was increased in CyC-AP null mice. The decreased TACE expression in CyC-AP null skin suggests CyC-AP may also regulate TACE via the altered expression of integrin beta 1. Our data suggest CyC-AP is involved in TNFα activation.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that cyclic mechanical stretching exerts anti-inflammatory effects on rabbit chondrocytes. But whether mechanical stretching has similar effects on human tendon fibroblasts are not known. This study therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretching regulates IL-1? induced COX-2 gene expression in a stretching magnitude-dependent manner. In custom-made silicone dishes, human patellar tendon fibroblasts (HPTFs) were grown on microgrooved culture surfaces, with which the shape and organization of HPTFs in vivo were closely mimicked. To induce inflammatory responses in HPTFs, 10?pM of IL-1? was added to the culture medium. A 4% or 8% cyclic uniaxial stretching was then applied to silicone dishes for 4?hrs using a custom-design stretching apparatus. After the end of stretching, total RNA of stretched and nonstretched tendon fibroblasts was collected, and RT-PCR was performed for measuring COX-2?mRNA expression levels. We found that tendon fibroblasts subjected to 4% stretching decreased COX-2?mRNA expression level by 20%(p?=?0.0002; n?=?6) compared to that of nonstretched, IL-1?-treated cells. However, cells subjected to 8% stretching showed a 39% increase (p?=?0.007, n?=?6) in COX-2?mRNA expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that small stretching (4%) has anti-inflammatory effects on HPTFs in a mildly inflammatory environment such as that induced by 10?pM of IL-1?. In contrast, large stretching (8%) may amplify inflammatory responses of tendon fibroblasts. Therefore, physical therapy with low levels of tendon stretching may be beneficial in reducing mild tendon inflammation. Supported by the Arthritis Investigator Award and NIHAR049921 (JHW)

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - We are studying in the role of endogenous electric fields in mammalian skin wound healing. The epidermis generates a transepithelial potential (TEP) of 20?50?mV across itself, inside positive. Any wound or break in the epidermis creates a low resistance pathway and the TEP at the wound site is 0?mV. However, the TEP of the intact epidermis around the wound is still present, resulting in a lateral voltage gradient or electric field along the skin surrounding the wound. We have evidence that this lateral electric field stimulates keratinocytes in the area to migrate towards the wound with the optimal response occurring at a field strength of 100?mV/mm. In order to determine the actual field strength present in mammalian wounds, we have developed a new instrument called the Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI). The BFI vibrates a small sensor perpendicular to the skin about 200??m above the surface and uses the capacitance signal to determine the surface potential of the epidermis just beneath the stratum corneum. By measuring this surface potential in many positions around the wound, we generate a spatial map of the surrounding electric field. We have measured the wound field near a 1?mm long, full thickness skin wound in mice. A field of 100?200?mV/mm is present immediately following wounding and persists until wound healing is complete. The topical application of a blocker of Na+ channels (amiloride) reduces this wound field by about 50%, supporting the hypothesis that it is generated by the TEP. Preliminary measurements on human skin wounds detect lateral electric fields that are similar to those measured in mice. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Tissue repair and wound healing are complex processes that involve inflammation, granulation, and tissue remodeling. Angiogenesis plays a central role in wound healing. Previously, we have shown that picroliv, a natural product obtained from the roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and insulin like growth factor (IGF) in rats during hypoxia (Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 1999; 56: 348?55). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of Picroliv in an ex vivo rat aorta ring model of angiogenesis. Picroliv enhanced the sprouting and migration of endothelial cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of picroliv in both unimpaired and dexamethasone (DX)-induced impaired cutaneous healing in a full thickness punch wound model in rats. The animals in the impaired healing group having been pretreated with DX. We studied the tissues by histology and morphometry. The data showed picroliv treatment resulted in improved reepithelialization, neovascularization, and migration of various cells such as endothelial, dermal myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts into the wound bed. Immunohistochemical localization showed an increased VEGF and alpha smooth muscle actin staining consistent with increased number of micro vessels in granulation tissue. These findings suggest that picroliv accelerated wound repair and thus could be developed as a therapeutic angiogenic agent for the wound healing.
