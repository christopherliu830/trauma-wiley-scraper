AB  - Abstract This article highlights the manifold ways that migrants strategically use their social networks in order to survive in Alberta with compromised legal status. The conditionality of their status is affected by individual encounters and by new policy developments, showing that their ability to control their life trajectories is constrained by factors beyond their control. Nevertheless, although they experienced high amounts of stress because of their situations, the role played by cognitive processes, which include imagining, strategizing, and what I call ?inter-provincial legal consciousness?, allowed them to exercise agency. These processes allowed them to build communities and networks of support and to imagine potential life paths in other provinces through other provinces? provincial nominee programmes.

AB  - Summary This chapter aims to explore the forensic setup and response capacity of the Philippines. It examines how this was applied in practice during the forensic humanitarian response to the Marawi crisis. The chapter discusses the forensic challenges that were encountered in this complex context. Under international humanitarian law the dead are a distinct category of victim, and as such have the right to have their personal dignity and identity protected. Ante-mortem data collection points were set up for purely humanitarian reasons to facilitate the identification of missing and suspected deceased individuals; no information for prosecution of any kind should be collected. A closer integration between the Management of the Dead and Missing Cluster and forensic specialists, many of whom are affiliated with the academic rather than the humanitarian sector would further facilitate a smoother identification process in the future.

AB  - Summary Hemophilia is a rare disorder that is complex to diagnose and to manage. These evidence-based guidelines offer practical recommendations on the diagnosis and general management of hemophilia, as well as the management of complications including musculoskeletal issues, inhibitors, and transfusion-transmitted infections. By compiling these guidelines, the World Federation of Hemophilia aims to assist healthcare providers seeking to initiate and/or maintain hemophilia care programs, encourage practice harmonization around the world and, where recommendations lack adequate evidence, stimulate appropriate studies.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding related to portal hypertension and coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. Complications and management of bleeding is a significant source of healthcare cost and utilization, as well as morbidity and mortality. Due to the scarcity of evidence surrounding transfusion strategies and hemostatic interventions in patients with cirrhosis, there has been significant debate regarding the best practice. Emerging data suggest that evidence supporting transfusion of packed red blood cells to a hemoglobin threshold of 7-8 g/dL is strong. thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists have shown promise in increasing platelet levels and reducing transfusions preprocedurally, although have not specifically been found to reduce bleeding risk. Data for viscoelastic testing (VET)-guided transfusions appear favorable for reducing blood transfusion requirements prior to minor procedures and during orthotopic liver transplantation. Hemostatic agents such as recombinant factor VIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates, and tranexamic acid have been examined but their role in cirrhotic patients is unclear. Other areas of growing interest include balanced ratio and whole blood transfusion. In the following manuscript, we summarize the most up to date evidence for threshold-guided, VET-guided, balanced-ratio, and whole blood transfusions as well as the use of hemostatic agents in cirrhotic patients to provide practice guidance to clinicians.
