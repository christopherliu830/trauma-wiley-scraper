AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.

AB  - Laminin is required for normal peripheral nerve development, as mutations causing absence of laminin-2 cause hereditary peripheral neuropathies (neuropathy of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and dystrophic mouse). We study the laminin receptors, integrins and dystroglycan, that link laminin in the basal lamina to the Schwann cells cytoskeleton. This linkage is defective in an animal model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F, in which the Periaxin/Dystrogycan/DRP-2 complex is disrupted. To study the role of laminin receptors in these peripheral neuropathies, we inactivated the gene for beta1 integrin and dystroglycan specifically in Schwann cells of transgenic mice. alpha6beta1 integrin is present in Schwann cells and their precursors before myelination, the absence of beta1 integrin causes a severe peripheral neuropathy due to the failure of Schwann cells to interact with axons during axonal sorting. Although more severe, this neuropathy is morphologically similar to that of dystrophic mice. In contrast, dystroglycan first appears in Schwann cells after axonal sorting and just prior to myelination (pro-myelinating Schwann cells). In the absence of dystroglycan, mice develop a neuropathy with abnormally folded myelin sheaths, slow conduction velocity and loss of DRP-2, similar to that of periaxin-null mice. These data show that alpha6beta1 integrin and dystroglycan subserve different roles during nerve development, and that they are involved at different steps in the pathogenesis of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F.

AB  - The present study was performed with the aim to compare different clinically-based neurotoxicity scales with a more extended composite scale (Total Neuropathy Scale) already validated in diabetic patients, in order to improve the grading of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity. The features of CIPN were evaluated in a series of women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel? based chemotherapy by clinical examination, neurophysiology and quantitative sensory testing of vibration threshold (VDT); the ECOG, Ajani and NCIC-CTC grades were assessed by a neurologist after clinical examination and the TNS was calculated after additional instrumental examination. At the same time, the treating oncologist, who was blinded as regards the results of the neurological examination, assessed the NCIC-CTC sensory neurotoxicity grade. The correlation existing between the different evaluations was evaluated with the Spearman test on a total of 97 visits. Our results indicate for all the neurotoxicity scales commonly used by oncologists and evaluated in this study a significant correlation with TNS; the interexaminer agreement comparison evaluation evidenced that in several cases the neurologist attributed a higher grade in the NCIC-CTC scale than the oncologist, and this discrepancy was mainly due to a different evaluation of the sensory impairment. In conclusion, the TNS can be used to assess effectively the severity of CIPN and the results of this evaluation can be reliably correlated with the oncological grading of sensory peripheral neurotoxicity; the wider range of TNS values, however, can allow a more accurate grading of the sensory impairment, a feature which can improve the estimate of CIPN changes, particularly in clinical trials; finally, the use of standardized methods of examination of the sensory function (e.g. the semiquantitative measure of vibration sensibility using the 128?Hz tuning fork) may reduce the interexaminer disagreement.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.
