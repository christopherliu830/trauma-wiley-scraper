AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - Pregnancy in one of the most frequent physiological conditions associated with CTS. During 2000, the Italian CTS study group (participants: T.Carboni-San Benedetto del Tronto, S.Massi-San Giovanni Valdarno; M.Mondelli-Siena, A.Morini-Trento, D.Murasecco-Perugia, L.Padua-Roma, M.Romano-Palermo) studied the incidence of CTS in pregnancy in women enrolled in 7 Italian centers. CTS was diagnosed clinically in 62% and neurophysiologically in 43% of women. During 2001, 12 and 15 month follow-up evaluation was performed. The aims were to evaluate: 1) evolution of CTS after delivery and lactation; 2) predictive value of electrodiagnostic assessment and clinical picture at the time of the first diagnosis. An extensive and complete description of the study design was previously reported. Evolution was assessed on the following CTS severity measurements: SYMPT, FUNCT, PAIN, Hi-Ob and neurophysiologic class. Overall, at follow up, 20 of 37 women (54%) who presented clinical CTS at first evaluation had clinical CTS. All patient-oriented measurements showed significant improvement of CTS. Conversely, neurophysiologic findings did not differ between baseline and follow-up. Although CTS severity measurements improved at follow-up, more than half of women with CTS symptoms during pregnancy complained of CTS symptoms one year after delivery. Moreover, the onset of symptoms during pregnancy was the most predictive factor for untreated CTS evolution. All patient-oriented and clinical measurements showed that an earlier onset of symptoms was a negative prognostic factor. According to the neurophysiologic evolution, weight gain appeared predictive: an higher gain implied a lower probability of improvement at follow-up examination.

AB  - A 26-year-old woman acutely developed bilateral sensory symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Neurophysiological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of CTS (severe at right and moderate at left hand). Because of the severity of the CTS in young patients without evident causes, we asked some further investigations in order to find a primary disease that might cause CTS. Endocrinological studies revealed a Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism. She was treated for the thyroiditis with improvement of thyroid function and entrapment syndrome. Neurophysiological controls confirmed the progressive improvement of CTS. The current case suggests to look for subclinical endocrinological disease when severe CTS is found in young patients without mechanical stress condition (work or hobby).

AB  - Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) is a myopathy causing asymmetric proximal and distal limb muscle involvement in patients over 50 years. Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neuron in the spinal cord and brainstem, characterized by progressive muscle weakness resulting in paralysis. The pathogenesis of cell injury in both diseases is still unknown: several hypothesis have been proposed addressing viral, autoimmunity, genetic and oxidation stress factors. We report on 2 cases with clinical presentation of upper and/or lower motor neuron involvement and histopathological diagnosis of IBM. Case 1: a 68 years old man with an 18-month history of progressive weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia. Neurological examination showed generalized muscle weakness, wasting of the finger flexors and quadriceps, fasciculations, deep tendon hyperreflexia. Electromyography (EMG) showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at limbs and tongue muscles. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced cMAP amplitude at the legs, Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) revealed marked pyramidal tract involvement. Blood examination showed increased E.S.R. with normal level of serum creatinine kinase, copper, ceruloplasmin, and iron. Antiganglioside antibodies titer was normal and blood lactate analysis showed normal values during exercise. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed increased protein level. Brain magnetic resonance imaging disclosed of involvement of the cortico-spinal tract and deposits of paramagnetic material in the basal ganglia with normal dopaminergic receptorial SPECT binding. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with ?rimmed vacuoles?. Case 2: a 64 years old woman with 20 month history of muscle weakness slowly progressing from upper to lower limbs. Neurological examination showed distal muscle weakness and wasting at the upper limbs, deep tendon hypo-areflexia. EMG showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at four limbs. MEP and nerve conduction studies were normal but H reflex and F late responses were absent. E.S.R. was increased, while antiganglioside antibodies titer, thyroid hormones dosage and CSF examination were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with rare ?rimmed vacuoles?. These case reports, although not nosologically defined, confirm the clinical variability of the IBM and rise questions on the possible mechanisms of neuronal damage in motor neuron syndromes.

AB  - Mutations in a gene encoding a novel protein of unknown function, the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1), are associated with one of the autosomal recessive forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT4A). Mutations in GDAP1 can cause both axonal and demyelinating inherited peripheral neuropathies. The GDAP1 gene maps on chromosome 8q21.1, encompassing 13.9?kb of genomic DNA. The coding sequence is comprised of six exons. Little is known about the function of GDAP1. The mouse homologue Gdap1 is highly expressed in brain. Northern-blot analysis showed that GDAP1 is also expressed in peripheral nerves, both in neurons and in Schwann cells. A series of Italian patients with demyelinating (n?=?42) and axonal (n?=?39) peripheral neuropathy with possible recessive inheritance was screened for mutations in the GDAP1 gene. The entire coding region, including exon-intron boundaries, was examined by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing. All patients were negative for the 17p11.2 duplication and for mutations in the MPZ, GJB1, PMP22 and EGR2 genes. SSCP analysis showed a few electrophoretic variants, in the exon 1, exon 3 and exon 4, respectively. Direct sequencing demonstrated the presence of a common single nucleotide polymorphism in the exon 4 (c.507T?>?G) and a nucleotide substitution in the exon 3. The latter was found in four patients, belonging to three families, and was not detected in a series of normal subjects. Further studies are in progress to evaluate the possible role of this variant in the pathophysiology of the disease. This work was partially supported by grants MURST 2000 to F.A. and Ministero della Sanità to P.M.

AB  - Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, characterized by rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic or nuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions. Clinical features are proximal and/or distal weakness, frequent muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia and poor responsiveness to steroid treatment. The involvement of peripheral nerve in both sporadic and familial IBM is a debated issue. Among six cases (five men; age range: 65?82?yrs.) of muscle biopsy proven sporadic IBM, we found variable neuropathic changes. Myogenic/neurogenic mixed EMG pattern was detected in four patients. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies showed abnormalities consistent with axonal multiple mononeuropathy in three and with axonal polyneuropathy in two patients, whereas one subject had no neurogenic findings. However, the degree of peripheral nerve impairment was usually mild and not related to severity of myopathy. Sural nerve biopsy was performed in the case with more prominent clinical and electrophysiological polyneuropathy. Moderate homogeneous loss of myelinated fibers, with recurrent regeneration clusters and atrophic/degenerating axons were observed. No segmental demyelination was present. In spite of marked inflammatory changes in muscle, neither mononuclear cell infiltrates nor filamentous inclusions were detected in nerve. Similarly, whereas paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions were observed in muscle, minor but recurrent mitochondrial changes were detected in nerve. Muscle mitochondrial abnormalities have been reported about twice in IBM compared with other inflammatory myopathies. A relation of this finding with high incidence of associated peripheral neuropathy in IBM and mitochondrial myopathies has been hypothesized. On the other hand, the follow-up of our patients shows improvement of nerve conduction values in clinically responders to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, suggesting a significant role of immune processes for the pathogenesis of nerve damage in IBM.

AB  - Demyelination and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation are hallmarks of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies, of which Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 A (CMT1A) neuropathy is the typical example. In CMT1A, an altered dosage of the PMP22 gene determines a defect of myelination and an abnormal SC phenotype, characterized by hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family of proteins, including EGF and neuregulins, and their receptors, namely EGFr and the erbB family, control growth and development of SC. Their expression in mature SC is down-regulated but, during Wallerian degeneration or chemical myelinolysis, these receptors are transiently over-expressed, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. On the other hand, neuregulin 1 inhibits SC myelination and induces demyelination and SC dedifferentiation and proliferation. These effects might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies. We have therefore immunolocalized EGF, EGFr and the erbB receptors (erbB 2, 3 and 4) in sural nerve biopsies from patients with CMT1A as compared to chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) nerve biopsies and to normal nerves, in order to evaluate if the expression of these molecules is up- or down-regulated in these disorders. Among CMT1A nerves, immunoreactivity for EGF, EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 was moderately to markedly increased in SC, particularly in onion bulbs, in most cases, while a mild to moderate expression of erbB 4 in SC cytoplasm was observed in a few cases. On the other hand in CIDP, which shares with CMT1A histopathological features such as de-remyelination and SC hyperplasia, only the expression of erbB 3 was up-regulated in a minority of cases. Since in SC the functional neuregulin receptor is a heterodimer, composed by erbB2 and erbB3, the parallel up-regulation of these two molecules in CMT1A may bear a functional significance. This would be confirmed if an overexpression of neuregulins could be demonstrated, along with our finding of an increased expression of EGF and its receptor. In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that, in CMT1A, a persistent activation of neuregulin signaling pathways not only is indicative of SC dedifferentiation but also may contribute to demyelination and onion bulb formation or maintenance.

AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are successfully used as immunomodulatory therapy in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) but their mechanism of action remains unknown. An anti-idiotypic block of pathogenic autoantibodies has been often postulated even if other possible mechanisms, including a modulation of the release of various cytokines, have been proposed. To evaluate the expression of cytokines in patients with MMN and their possible modulation by IVIg, we determined circulating levels of TNFα, INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12 by ELISA in serum samples of 17 patients with MMN and compared them with 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 with multiple sclerosis (MS), 6 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 5 with myasthenia gravis (MG) and 12 healthy controls (NS). Comparable levels of INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10 and IL12 were detected in patients? sera and controls. Even if TNFα levels did not differ significantly among patients? groups, they were higher than in any healthy control (mean?±?SD 1.2?±?0.5?pg/ml, range 0.7?2.4?pg/ml), in 12 (70%) MMN patients (mean?±?SD 3.6?±?1.9?pg/ml; range 0.2?7.5?pg/ml), all ALS, 3 MS (25%), 2 CIDP (40%) and 2 MG (40%). We then measured the concentration of TNFα before and after IVIg therapy in 9 MMN and 2 ALS patients. In all but one MMN patients, circulating levels of TNFα slightly increased after treatment with IVIg (mean values 4.3 vs. 7.2?pg/ml) and decreased 3 weeks after therapy while in both ALS patients they decreased or remained unchanged. No detectable level of TNFα was found in IVIg preparation. This study shows that, similarly to what previously reported in other autoimmune neuropathy as GBS and CIDP, TNFα serum levels are slightly increased in MMN but, at odds with what reported in these disease, their concentration tend to increase parallel to clinical improvement after IVIg therapy. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenetic implication of this finding and in particular whether a possible deviation from a presumably Th2 to a Th1 immune response may help explaining the effect of IVIg in MMN.

AB  - We studied the effect of chronic compression of median nerve at wrist on cutaneous innervation. Two-mm punch biopsies were obtained from third fingertip in 40 patients (32 female and 8 male, age range 30?74 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with diabetes and other metabolic or endocrinological disorders or with electrophysiological findings of a diffuse neuropathy were excluded. By means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy we counted epidermal nerve fibers, Meissner corpuscles and myelinated papillary endings. All patients underwent electrophysiological study and quantitative sensory testing using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for tactile threshold and Medoc TSA II Neurosensory analyzer for thermal threshold evaluation. Morphological and functional data were compared with age and sex matched controls. We observed abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers, mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents in all patients. These abnormalities ranged from mild to marked and appeared more severe in patients with a longer disease duration and a slower conduction velocity along the median nerve.

AB  - The pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the progressive death of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to a clinical pictures mainly characterized by weakness, muscle wasting, brisk reflexes and Babinski sign. Routine electromyographic and electroneurographic studies are mandatory to a correct diagnosis but are unable to precisely quantify the pathological changes in the motor unit. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is a recent neurophysiological technique that allows to estimate number and amplitude of motor units in single muscles in order to assess the severity of ALS and to follow-up the progression of the disease. We applied this technique in 15 patients (12 male and 3 female; mean age?±?SD: 65.7?±?9.5?yrs, range 45?82), affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria, and in 11 healthy subjects (4 male and 7 female; mean age?±?SD: 63.7?±?8.2?yrs, range 50?76), in order to assess changes in motor unit features of abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in the mean number of motor units between the two groups: 75 in ADM and 51,8 in TA in the ALS cohort vs. 283,5 in ADM and 96,9 in the healthy subjects. Conversely, the differences in the mean and maximal area between the two groups did not reach the statistical significance (ALS patients: max area 34.7?mVms, mean area 1.9?mVms; healthy subjects: max area 18.2?mVms, mean area 0.9?mVms). Our preliminary results confirm that MUNE is able to quantify the pathological changes in motor unit parameter and represents an adequate follow-up tool for disease progression and effectiveness of pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN) is a well-recognized subacute painful asymmetric proximal and distal lower limb neuropathy. DLRPN may be associated with thoracic and upper limb involvement. The latter may appear as compression mononeuropathies and as a more diffuse disorder consistent with cervicobrachial radiculoplexus neuropathy (DCRPN). We performed a multiperspective study of patients, seen between 1999?2002, with diabetes and acute or subacute onset and progression of unilateral or asymmetric bilateral proximal and/or distal weakness in lower and/or upper limbs. We excluded patients who had compression mononeuropathies or radiculopathies, multineuropathies or asymmetric poly(radiculo)neuropathies, motor neuron disease as suggested by clinical, electrophysiological, laboratory or MRI findings. During the study period we observed 18 patients with diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. Most patients were middle-aged or elderly and male preponderance was noted. Ten patients had DLPRN, 6 both DLPRN and DCRPN, 2 isolated DCRPN. DCRPN affected prevalently hands and forearms, unilaterally in 3 patients, bilaterally in 5, and improved spontaneously but incompletely in most patients in several months. Pain was not a prominent feature except for one patient. We conclude that diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy may involve the cervicobrachial regions not only in association with DLRPN but also alone.

AB  - We report a case of peripheral both demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy in a patient affected from intestinal aganglionosis with high dose intermittent metronidazole therapy. Intestinal aganglionosis is a myenteric plexus disorder with lack of innervation concerning the whole digestive tract from the rectum to the esophagus. The familial incidence of this condition seems to be high and a recessive autosomal transmission is likely. In the pathogenesis of this disorder aberrant neural crest migration seems to be implicated: indeed frequent neurologic signs resembling dysautonomic ones, deafness and rare peripheral demyelinating or axonal neuropathies are associated. The patient was a 12 years old female child affected by intestinal aganglionosis and underwent to chronic intermittent Metronidazole treatment, with daily doses of 500?mg for 15 day every month. She was admitted to our Hospital for inability to walk, dysesthesias and pain at lower limbs, acutely started and progressively worsening. At the admission neurological examination showed ataxic gait with bilateral foot drop, severe distal weakness, bilateral tibialis anterior muscle atrophy, absent deep tendon reflexes, rapidly worsening. CSF was normal. Antibodies against to peripheral nerve (antigangliosides, sulfatide, MAG, glycosaminoglycans) resulted negative. Spinal cord MRI revealed increased roots size and increased epidural space. EMG showed denervation spontaneous activity with neurogenic MUAP modification on distal muscles. Nerve conduction study showed severe slowing of motor velocity on right and left peroneal nerves with reduced amplitude of CMAP. Sensory conduction was mild slowing on both sural nerves with reduced amplitude of SAP. Metronidazole therapy was discontinued; desametazone, high dose vitamin and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was established in addition to rehydration and parenteral nutrition. Clinical conditions progressively improved and at two months follow up the girl was able to walk with mild ataxia. The authors emphasize in described case the difficulty to differentiate toxic or vitamin deficiency or autoimmune pathogenesis.

AB  - Peripheral neurotoxicity is a severe side effect of several effective antineoplastic drugs. Different attempts have been previously performed in order to reduce the neurotoxicity of antineoplastic compounds, but so far an effective neuroprotective treatment is not available. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a natural occurring compound with a neuroprotective activity in several experimental paradigms and in clinical use for the treatment of painful neuropathies. In this study we have tested in two rat models the hypothesis that ALC may have a protective role on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments in different tumor systems indicated the lack of interference of ALC in the antitumor effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel. ALC co-treatment was able to significantly reduce the neurotoxicity of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in well-established rat models and this effect was correlated with a modulation of the plasma levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cisplatin model. The protective effect of ALC was confirmed also in in vitro studies on differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where ALC treatment counteracted the paclitaxel and cisplatin-induced cell damage, as measured by reduction of neurite elongation. In a search for the mechanism(s) of ALC neuroprotection, the transcriptional profile of gene expression in PC12 cells determined by microarray analysis indicated that ALC, in the presence of NGF, was able to modulate various genes relevant in the tissue-specific toxicity, such as NGFI-A. Moreover, we observed that labeled acetyl groups derived from ALC were transferred into histones and that cells co-treatment with NGF and ALC increased the level of histones H4 acetylation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of genes implicated in the protection against specific damage induced by neurotoxic agent may be the result of modulation of histone acetylation mediated by transfer of ALC acetyl groups. Overall, these results provide the first evidence that ALC is a neuroprotective agent acting through a novel mechanism that appears to be important for counteracting the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity secondary to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Inflammatory vasculopathy is observed in 20 to 66% of nerve biopsies in diabetic neuropathy, especially in patients with proximal diabetic neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy) or with other patterns of multifocal neuropathy. Moreover there is growing evidence that diabetic patients have an increased predisposition to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). Many authors suggest that there is a more pervasive contribution of inflammatory and immuno-mediated damage to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy than had previously been imagined. In these patients, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated. However differentiating CIDP in diabetic patients from diabetic neuropathy (DNP) may be difficult. We tried to differentiate immuno-mediated and inflammatory neuropathies in diabetic patients with polyneuropathy revealing the presence of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the endoneurium. MMPs are calcium-dependent zinc endopeptidases which are able to degrade the basement membrane and thus contribute to tissue destruction and cell invasion. Sural nerve biopsies were taken from 10 diabetic patients with CIDP and 5 patients with DNP. Immunohistochemistry was performed for T-cells, macrophages, von Willebrand factor and MMP-9. Endoneurial and epineurial immunoreactivity was evaluated and quantified separately. Small epineurial T-cells infiltrates were present in 5 out of 10 CIDP patients and in none of DNP patients. In CIDP patients 53% of endoneurial vessels were immunoreactive for MMP-9 against only 12% in DNP patients and this difference reached a statistical significance. In conclusion we demonstrated that immunoreactivity of MMP-9 is strongly enhanced in diabetic patients with CIDP but not in patients with DNP. The pattern of immunoreactivity may help to select patients for a trial with immunosuppressant drugs.

AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a monophasic illness. Early nadir and lack of multiple relapses have differentiated it from the chronic form (CIDP). We present a case whose unusual course overlaps both disorders. A 71-year-old man presented with paresthesiae and weakness evolving over 1-week period, 2 weeks after an upper respiratory infection. Spinal fluid analysis and electrophysiologic findings supported the clinical diagnosis of GBS. He was treated with a 5-day course of IVIG with rapid, almost complete recovery over the following 10 days. Four weeks later, his symptoms recurred. Another dose of IVIG produced rapid but transient improvement. He was started on oral steroids but continued to deteriorate. Clinical and laboratory reevaluation confirmed the presence of an inflammatory polyradiculopathy; IVIG was resumed. Over the following 3 months, his clinical course was characterized by 3 increasingly severe deteriorations, the last one to quadriplegia, severe bulbar dysfunction requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement, ophthalmoplegia and autonomic dysfunction. Transient improvements occurred between these relapses. Aggressive treatment, which included IVIG, plasma exchange, IV steroids and IV cyclophosphamide, did not produce sustained benefit. He remained pseudo-locked-in for 10 days. Another 5-day IVIG course was completed; he began to improve and continued to do so over the following 5 weeks. The nadir of GBS is usually reached within 4 weeks. Treatment fluctuations usually occur within the first weeks, and relapse during the recovery phase is often limited and isolated. Multiple relapses until a defined nadir are highly uncommon. The bulbar and cranial nerve involvement, rapidity of the relapses, dysautonomia, need for mechanical ventilation, and improving electrophysiology all argue against the diagnosis of CIDP. It remains unknown whether repeated doses of IVIG could change the natural course of this disease leading to such an unusual temporal profile.
