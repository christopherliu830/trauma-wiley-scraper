AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - *Software NEUROPA based on the ?consensus? Committee for standardization of measurements on polyneuropathy of the Gruppo di Studio Sistema Nervoso Periferico (Antonimi G, Cavaletti G, Di Iorio G Fabrizi G, Galardi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Ghirlanda P, Lori S, Nobile-Orazio E, Padua L, Scarpini E, Schenone A, Tonali P, Uncini A, Vita G). Kind of study: survey prospective multicentric multidimensional study. Aim of the study: to evaluate the characteristic (including disability and Health Related Quality of life - HRQoL) a representative sample of patients with suspected, or diagnosed, polyneuropathy (or multineuropathy) admitted in neurological centers. The HRQoL dimension of the study was developed with the collaboration of the Quality of Life Study group of the Italian Neurological Society. Timing: The period of enrollment started on 1-10-02 e will end on 30-01-03. Acquired data: Besides clinical data we acquire data on the diagnostic pathway the patients have done, disability, HRQoL. All the data are monthly sent to the Department of Neuroscience of Università Cattolica where statistical analysis will be performed. Conclusion: The acquired data will provide information on 1) the frequency of the different type of disease we have to study in the different kind of centers; 2) the clinical picture and the actual involvement in daily activity of this kind of patients and therefore the priority we have to give them; 3) the necessities of the neurological centers where this kind of patients are admitted and therefore what we have to requests to the national and regional sanitary service to better study this kind of patients and to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. # Antonini G, Bacci A, Cardinali P, Cavalletti G, Cocito D, Corbo, Di Iorio, Fabrizi GM, Fazio R, Galassi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Girlanda P, Insola A, Liguori R, Maggio M, Mazzeo A, Messina C, Murasecco D, Nemni R, Nobile Orazio E, Pareyson D, Porazzi D, Quattrini A, Ragno M, Rizzuto N, Romano M, Santoro L, Sartucci F, Sabatelli M, Schenone A, Sghirlanzoni, Siciliano G, Villacara A, Vita G.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - CMT1A is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy due to increased genetic dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). The functions of PMP22 as a structural protein of peripheral myelin and a regulator of the proliferation, differentiation, shaping and apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) are well known. However, the effects of its overexpression on the molecular phenotype of SCs are still unclear. In order to detect genes that are modulated by PMP22 overexpression, we performed a cDNA microarrays experiment on PMP22 overexpressing sciatic nerves from a transgenic model of CMT1A. Differential expression of 117 known genes that are sensitive to PMP22 dosage was observed. The number of up- and down-regulated genes in the transgenic nerves was 99 and 144 respectively, of 22.000 spotted genes. In the up-regulated group, the number of known genes was 30 and the number of EST was 69. In the down-regulated group, the number of known genes was 87 and that of EST 57. We classified the differentially expressed genes into functional categories. Among these, we focused our attention on groups of down-regulated genes coding for cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins and for extracellular matrix components, like collagens. Moreover we identified a group of genes with chromosomal localization in candidate regions for demyelinating neuropathies. The differential expression of several sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR, performed both on normal and transgenic rat sciatic nerves, and on primary SCs cultures obtained from normal and CMT1A rats. Therefore, we point out the importance of the interaction between SCs and extracellular matrix and the involvement of SCs cytoskeletal organization in the pathogenesis of CMT1A. Moreover, this study suggests us new candidate genes that could be submitted to sequence analysis in demyelinating CMT.

AB  - 50?60% of CIDP patients show a clinical remission with the administration of standard therapies. Unfortunately, the achievement of this goal does not conclude patients? troubles but coincide with the beginning of another story whose course is often uncertain. In our study of CIDP patients we attempted to establish the fate of 36 patients showing an initial remission after treatments. Over a long-term period of follow-up, we observed that the disease in these patients can follow 3 different clinical courses. A first group of 11 patients had a monophasic disease. All of them achieved a complete remission after therapy with corticosteroids and no relapses were observed after drug interruption over a follow-up period of 6 months-12 years. The duration of treatment varied between 3?24 months. A second group of 6 patients had a relapsing course; these patients became asymptomatic with corticosteroids but relapsed after a period of time of at least six months (range 6 months-16 years) since therapy suspension. The number of relapses varied from 1 to 4. A third group was represented by patients (19 in our series) who needed continuous treatment over a long period of time to maintain improvement. The apparent relapsing-remitting course in these patients was always related to tapering of therapies. The duration of this chronic active form ranged from 2 to 17 years. 5 patients of the last group were able to top therapies without evidence of worsening over a follow-up period of 2?12 years. This subgroup of patients had a prolonged monophasic course rather than a relapsing-remitting form. Our findings show that CIDP is a heterogeneous disease encompassing cases with a single monophasic episode in which the term ?chronic?, with respect to GBS, is referred mainly to the prolonged phase of worsening and cases in which the chronic nature of the condition in outlined by the long duration (up to decades) of the ?active phase?, made-up of therapy-related relapses/remissions.

AB  - Traditional outcome assessment in neurological diseases has always been based on physician-derived and instrumental findings. Over the last two decades, clinical and public health researchers emphasized the need for a thorough evaluation of concepts such as Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) to study the impact of chronic illnesses and their treatments on the patient's life. The most frequent inherited neuropathy is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CMT Patients develop progressive weakness and sensory disturbances, becoming sometimes severely disabled even at very young age. In CMT clinic, neurophysiologic, pathologic and genetic evaluation, are considered fundamental to assess nerve involvement and diagnose, but how these findings are related to HRQoL and disability is not assessed. We propose a prospective follow-up (24?30 months) of CMT patients with multiple measurements of CMT. Besides conventional clinic, pathologic, neurophysiologic and genetic measurements we adopt validated patient-oriented measurements to assess HRQoL and disability. Aims of the study are: 1) to assess HRQoL and disability of CMT patients in a wide and well-represented sample and to evaluate the relationships between conventional parameters and the patient's perception of his own HRQoL and disability; 2) to evaluate natural history of HRQoL and disability in CMT, and to evaluate the predictive value of phenotype, genetic picture, neurophysiological and pathological pattern 3) to develop a national network and a database on CMT disease (this aim includes the standardization, based on a consensus validation process, of the most used terms and measurements in CMT and the development of a database software). In a preliminary reunion, the authors developed a dedicated database for patients affected by CMT. Details about this database will be presented.

AB  - Gangliosides (Gs) have been implicated as potential antigens in autoimmune neuropathies and anti-tumoral immune response, but their role in paraneoplastic neuropathy has been poorly investigated. We describe one patient affected by lung adenocarcinoma and subacute motor axonal neuropathy with high titres of IgG1 and IgG3 to several Gs. Expansion (3% of total T cells) of peripheral g/d T lymphocytes was found, as compared to healthy controls (<0.5%) and to patients with lung neoplasia without neuropathy (1.1%). At three months after neoplasia removal, we observed stabilization of the neuropathy, decline of anti-Gs IgG and of g/d T cells, which dropped to normal values. Expression of GM1, GD1a, GM2 and GM3 was found by immunohistochemistry on patient's neoplastic cells, but not in control lung neoplasia. Absorption experiments of anti-Gs IgG revealed that only GD1a and GM1, among all Gs tested, significantly decreased anti-Gs IgG reactivity. Indirect immunohistochemistry with biotinylated IgG purified from the patient showed positive signals on motoneurons, dorsal root ganglia, axonal structures and Schwann cells and his own neoplastic cells. At autopsy, IgG deposits were found on the same neural targets. Purified IgG from the patient exerted high levels of cytotoxicity on both Schwann and neuroblastoma cells, as compared to healthy controls. The association of neoplasia, peripheral neuropathy and autoimmune responses to Gs observed in our patient proposes a pathogenetic role for Gs as putative autoantigens in paraneoplastic neuropathy.

AB  - We describe a patient affected by MMN with CB exhibiting unusual progression and clinical features. MMN is a chronic immune mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive painless asymmetrical weakness usually in distal limb muscles. GM1 antibodies are found in high titer in 22%- 84% of cases. Electrophysiological findings are CB not at usual sites of compression, abnormal temporal dispersion and F-waves, normal or near-normal sensory conduction studies. This 63 year old woman was referred for evaluation of one year and half duration weakness which began in right upper limb and progressed to contralateral and to lower extremities. On first admission (July 2001) neurological examination showed normal cranial nerves and sensory testing, severe asymmetric weakness mainly proximal in the upper extremities and distal in the lower. There were atrophy of small hand muscles and weak deep reflexes. She denied sensory symptoms. There were no upper motor neuron signs. Laboratory tests including CK, tumor marker, CSF, anti-GM1 antibodies were unremarkable. Electrophysiological study was consistent with MMN with CB. Patient underwent IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) and PE without significant improvement. In October 2002, her conditions rapidly worsened: she became quadriplegic, unable to swallow, to chew and to protrude her tongue. Admitted to ICU because of respiratory failure, tracheotomy was performed. Repeated searches for GM1 antibodies gave negative results. CSF was still normal. IVIG was administered twice with partial benefit although severe disability persisted. The case presented has notable features: the rapid monophasic progression to quadriplegia within two years and half, the acute worsening in absence of precipitating events and of systemic illness, the severe involvement of cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. The late response to IVIG is in favor of an immune mediated disorder despite the absence of GM1 antibodies.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - The X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the Connexin 32 gene (Cx32) and is the second most common CMT subtype after CMT1A, in which the 17p11.2 duplication is the underlying molecular defect. CMTX is characterized by no male-to-male transmission, intermediate motor conduction velocities (MCV), and more severe disease in males. In our series of CMT patients, we found 9 different Cx32 mutations in 11 families. Overall there were 26 patients, 13 males and 13 females, aged 11?76?yrs. Age at onset ranged considerably (1?60?yrs), but symptoms began earlier in males (mean 15.4?yrs, 77% within age 20) than in females (mean 25?yrs). All patients were autonomous, but disease severity was greater in males, while 4 female carriers were asymptomatic. Pain and tremor were frequent complaints. Two patients had Babinski sign and one had rest tremor. Nerve conduction studies were performed in 23 patients (13 males, 10 females). Upper limb motor conduction velocities (MCV) ranged between 25 and 57?m/s, and were slower in males (25?48?m/s) than in females (34?57?m/s). MCV were in the upper range of CMT1 (25?38?m/s) in 10/13 males but only in 3/10 females. In some cases, nerve conduction slowing was non-uniform within single nerves, and one female patient had a previous diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. There was considerable asymmetry of involvement between different nerves. The median nerve was often more severely affected than the ulnar nerve, and not only in females, as previously reported, but also in males. Therefore, it appears unlikely that this asymmetry is accounted for by a Lyonization phenomenon. Subclinical abnormalities of central nervous system as revealed by multimodal evoked potential studies were found in 8/10 patients. Expression of Cx32 in the brain is the likely explanation of this finding that confirms previous non-systematic observations. We found seven missense and two nonsense mutations (one novel mutation). Two families presented distinct mutations at the same codon (Arg164), while the Arg22Stop and Arg220Stop mutations were each found in two unrelated cases.
