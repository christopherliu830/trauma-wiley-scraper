AB  - calleja p., aitken l.m.  (b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost a decade for hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Its off-label use as a hemostatic agent in massive bleeding caused by a wide array of clinical scenarios is rapidly expanding. While evidence-based guidelines exist for rFVIIa treatment in hemophilia, none are available for its off-label use. Objectives:?The aim of this study is to develop expert recommendations for the use of rFVIIa in patients suffering from uncontrolled bleeding (with special emphasis on trauma) until randomized, controlled trials allow for the introduction of more established evidence-based guidelines. Methods:?A multidisciplinary task force comprising representatives of the relevant National Medical Associations, experts from the Medical Corps of the Army, Ministry of Health and the Israel National Trauma Advisory Board was established in Israel. Recommendations were construed based on the analysis of the first 36 multi-trauma patients accumulated in the prospective national registry of the use of rFVIIa in trauma, and an extensive literature search consisting of published and prepublished controlled animal trials, case reports and series. The final consensus guidelines, together with the data of the first 36 trauma patients treated in Israel, are presented in this article. Results:?Results of the first 36 trauma patients: The prolonged clotting assays [prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] shortened significantly within minutes following administration of rFVIIa. Cessation of bleeding was achieved in 26 of 36 (72%) patients. Acidosis diminished the hemostatic effect of the drug, while hypothermia did not affect it. The survival rate of 61% (22/36) seems to be favorable compared with published series of similar, or less severe, trauma patients (range 30%?57%). Conclusions:?As a result of the lack of controlled trials, our guidelines should be considered as suggestive rather than conclusive. However, they provide a valuable tool for physicians using rFVIIa for the expanding off-label clinical uses.

AB  - Summary Burns are classified by cause and mechanism, as well as by extent (expressed as percentage of total body surface area or TBSA) and depth. Inhalation injury is caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion or chemical powders and vapours. Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis for a given extent of cutaneous injury. Timely initiation of appropriate first aid (20 minutes of cool running water for thermal injuries) minimises the extent of tissue damage. Extensive burns constitute major trauma and may be associated with multi-trauma. Patients with major burns require primary and secondary survey, and active resuscitation according to a formula related to size of burn. Burn wounds evolve and require regular review and appropriate dressings. Deep circumferential burns may require escharotomy. Extensive burns are associated with systemic effects, which are a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory response that involves all organs and necessitates provision of critical and multidisciplinary care. Surgical management of extensive burns entails early excision of all necrotic tissue, temporisation of the wound with skin substitutes, and timely grafting according to an established algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To develop a scoring system model that predicts mortality within 30?days of admission of patients older than 80?years admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A total of 306 ICUs from 24 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Older adults admitted to European ICUs (N?=?3730; median age?=?84?years [interquartile range?=?81-87 y]; 51.8% male). MEASUREMENTS Overall, 24 variables available during ICU admission were included as potential predictive variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Model sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS The 30-day-mortality was 1562 (41.9%). In multivariable analysis, these variables were selected as independent predictors of mortality: age, sex, ICU admission diagnosis, Clinical Frailty Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The discrimination, accuracy, and calibration of the model were good: the area under the curve for a score of 10 or higher was .80, and the Brier score was .18. At a cut point of 10 or higher (75% of all patients), the model predicts 30-day mortality in 91.1% of all patients who die. CONCLUSION A predictive model of cumulative events predicts 30-day mortality in patients older than 80?years admitted to ICUs. Future studies should include other potential predictor variables including functional status, presence of advance care plans, and assessment of each patient's decision-making capacity.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To analyze the risk of tooth loss and complications in periodontal ligament (PDL) healing following extrusive and lateral luxation in the permanent dentition. Materials and methods Eighty-two permanent teeth (78 patients) with extrusive luxation and 179 teeth (149 patients) with lateral luxation were included in the study. All teeth were examined according to a standardized protocol including clinical, photographic, and radiographic registration. Follow-up controls were performed at regular intervals (3, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1, 5, and 10 years). Statistics: The risk of repair-related resorption (surface resorption), infection-related resorption (inflammatory resorption), ankylosis-related resorption (replacement resorption), marginal bone loss, and tooth loss was analyzed with the Kaplan?Meier method. Differences among subgroups were analyzed with log-rank test and Cox regression. Results The risk of periodontal healing complications was estimated after 3 years. Extrusive luxation: For immature root development, infection-related resorption was 2.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0?6.9%). For mature root development, repair-related resorption was 15.6% (95% CI: 4.4?26.7%), infection-related resorption was 5.1% (95% CI: 0?11.7%), and marginal bone loss was 17.5% (95% CI: 6.2?28.8%). No teeth showed ankylosis-related resorption, and no teeth were lost in the observation period. Lateral luxation: For immature root development, repair-related resorption was 2.1% (95% CI: 0?6.1%), infection-related resorption was 2.1% (95% CI: 0?6.1%). For mature root development, repair-related resorption was 29.5% (95% CI: 20.5?38.5%), infection-related resorption was 2.6% (95% CI: 0?6.4%), ankylosis-related resorption was 0.8% (95% CI: 0?2.3%), marginal bone loss was 6.9% (95% CI: 2.2?11.6%). Conclusion The risk of severe periodontal healing complications in teeth with extrusive and lateral luxation injuries is generally low. Marginal bone loss and repair-related resorption occurred significantly more often in teeth with mature rather than immature root development. Marginal bone loss was associated with injuries involving multiple teeth.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims, and objectives This paper examines a remarkable dispute between Dutch insurers, hospitals, doctors, and patients about a set of quality indicators. In 2013, private insurers planned to drastically reform Dutch emergency care using quality indicators they had formulated drawing from clinical guidelines, RCTs, and systematic reviews. Insurers' plans caused much debate in the field of emergency care. As quality indicators have come to play a more central role in health care governance, the questions what constitutes good evidence for them, how they ought to be used, and who controls them have become politically and morally charged. This paper is a case study of how a Dutch public knowledge institution, the National Health Care Institute, intervened in this dispute and how they addressed these questions. Method We conducted ethnographic research into the knowledge work of the National Health Care Institute. Research entailed document analysis, participant observation, in-depth conversations, and formal interviews with 5 key-informants. Results The National Health Care Institute problematized not only the evidence supporting insurers' indicators, but also?and especially?the scope, purpose, and use of the indicators. Our analysis shows the institute's struggle to reconcile the technical rationality of quality indicators with their social and political implications in practice. The institute deconstructed quality indicators as national standards and, instead, promoted the use of indicators in dialogue with stakeholders and their local and contextual knowledge. Conclusions Even if quality indicators are based on scientific evidence, they are not axiomatically good or useful. Both proponents and critics of Evidence-based Medicine always feared uncritical use of evidence by third parties. For non-medical parties who have no access to primary care processes, the type of standardized knowledge professed by Evidence-based Medicine provides the easiest way to gain insights into ?what works? in clinical practice. This case study reminds us that using standardized knowledge for the management of health care quality requires the involvement of stakeholders for the development and implementation of indicators, and for the interpretation of their results.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine is used in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a short-term sedative. The data included in the manufacturer's product information is controversial, and there is little consensus to guide initial dosing and titration. This observational study surveyed the practice of dexmedetomidine use in Australian ICUs. An expression of interest (EOI) for a multisite observational study was sent to members of the ICU email group of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists Australia (SHPA). Participating members collected treatment-related data for patients meeting inclusion criteria between January 2013 and July 2014. Six of 14 sites that responded positively to the EOI returned complete datasets, and 232 patients met the inclusion criteria. The main reported indications for dexmedetomidine use across the six sites were to manage agitation (33.2%), to aid extubation (32.8%) and to sedate (34.0%). The median duration of therapy was 42 h (range 1?672 h). Only nine patients (3.9%) received loading doses. The median maximum dose used for maintenance therapy in patients ranged from 1.2 to 4.0 microgram/kg per h. There was a significant disparity of practice across sites, as evidenced by differences in reported indication, off-label use, rates of loading doses and doses used for maintenance therapy. Consensus prescribing guidelines are required to guide more consistent and evidence-based prescribing of dexmedetomidine.

Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Aim To determine whether the placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube (PPFT) can be taught safely and effectively to a critical care dietitian. Methods This is a prospective observational study conducted in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The intervention consisted of 19 attempts at post-pyloric intubation by the dietitian. The 10 ?learning? attempts were performed by the dietitian under the direction of an experienced (having completed in excess of 50 successful tube placements) user. A subsequent nine ?consolidation? attempts were performed under the responsibility of the intensive care consultant on duty. The primary outcome measures were success (i.e. tip of the PPFT being visible in or distal to the duodenum on X-ray) and time (minutes) to PPFT placement. Patients were observed for adverse events per standard clinical practice. Results A total of 19 post-pyloric tube placements were attempted in 18 patients (52 (23?70) years, ICU admission diagnoses: trauma n = 4; respiratory failure n = 3; and burns, pancreatitis and renal failure n = 2 each). No adverse events occurred. Most (75%) patients were sedated, and mechanically ventilated. Prokinetics were used to assist tube placement in 11% (2/19) of attempts, both of which were successful. Placement of PPFT was successful in 58% (11/19) of attempts. Whilst training, the success rate was 40% (4/10) compared with 78% (7/9) once training was consolidated (P = 0.17). In the successful attempts, the mean time to placement was 11.0 minutes (3.9?27.1 minutes). Conclusions A dietitian can be trained to safely and successfully place PPFT in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To describe and identify the relationship between ED length of stay (LOS) and mortality after ICU admission. Methods:? We undertook a retrospective cohort study of records from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006). Data from 45 hospitals and 48?803 ED patients directly transferred to ICU were included. Patients were divided into ED LOS < 8?h and ED LOS ≥ 8?h. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results:? Median ED LOS was 3.9?h (interquartile range 2.0?6.8). Patients transferred within 8?h (80.9%) were younger (P < 0.001) and more seriously ill (higher mortality and mechanical ventilation rate) than those transferred ≥8?h. There was no clear relationship between ED LOS and hospital survival for patients admitted directly to ICU (odds ratio = 1.01 per hour, 95% confidence intervals 0.99?1.02). Conclusion:? Although 20% of critically ill patients spend more than 8?h in ED before transfer to ICU, we were unable to demonstrate an adverse relationship between time in ED and hospital mortality.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of including the fractured vertebra in the short-segment fixation of thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Methods A total of 32 patients with thoraco-lumbar fractures, selected between August 2013 and February 2016, were managed by short-segment fixation with screws at the level of the fracture, and decompression was performed only for patients with neurological deficits. The patients' functional outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score for neurological condition. All patients were followed up with radiographs. Results Patients with complete neurologic deficits (n = 3) did not show any neurologic recovery. All ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C. Five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA E. The remaining five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA D. All ASIA D patients improved to ASIA B. At the final follow-up examination, the mean anterior vertebral height was 21?±?5?mm, indicating no significant height loss during the follow-up period. Conclusion Short-segment fixation of TL fractures with inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers good correction of segmental kyphosis, vertebral wedging, and vertebral height loss.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.
