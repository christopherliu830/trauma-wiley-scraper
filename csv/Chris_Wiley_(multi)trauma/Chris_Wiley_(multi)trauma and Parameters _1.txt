AB  - Abstract Background Adequate nutrition is linked to improved patient outcomes during critical illness. Nutrition care is further enhanced by registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) order-writing privileges, which improve the implementation of nutrition interventions. The purpose of this performance improvement project was to evaluate the effect of RDN order-writing privileges on enteral nutrition (EN) order compliance and nutrition delivery in selected intensive care units (ICUs) at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Methods Patients admitted to selected ICUs from January 23, 2018, to January 25, 2018, were screened for eligibility. Demographic and nutrition data were collected retrospectively from the electronic health record. Percent of energy and protein needs met were calculated. Data were compared with historical internal controls identified prior to RDN order-writing privileges. Results Fifty adult patients (150 EN days) were included in data analysis, with 93 patients (279 EN days) included in historical data. Compared with historical data, cumulative EN order compliance increased by 17% and tube feed infusion rate compliance by 15% post-RDN order-writing privileges. Mean (± SD) protein needs delivered significantly increased from 72.1 ± 28.6% to 89.1 ± 24.8% after RDN order-writing implementation (P < 0.001). Conclusions RDN order-writing privileges improved EN order compliance and significantly improved protein delivery in selected ICUs. Future studies are recommended to confirm these results and determine if other variables besides protein delivery are statistically significant with a larger sample size.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children ≤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemorrhage due to elective or emergency surgery results in significant patient morbidity and mortality and consumption of scarce transfusion resources. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been proposed as a universal hemostatic agent which may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and in treating unexpected massive hemorrhage in surgical patients. In elective surgery, a small number of randomized studies have shown a limited benefit for rFVIIa in the reduction of transfusion requirements. In massive hemorrhage associated with surgery, two case series and a growing number of case reports suggest that rFVIIa is successful as salvage therapy. However, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal dose, the true rate of thromboembolic complications and the overall survival and cost benefit when rFVIIa is used for this indication. In this review, the role of rFVIIa in managing blood loss in surgical patients is assessed in the light of current evidence.

AB  - Although the general surgeon who takes emergency call may be confronted with a patient who has sustained a blunt liver injury, the decrease in road trauma and work-place accidents has meant that this will be an infrequent occurrence. Minimal exposure will, of necessity, extrapolate to difficulty in coping with a catastrophic event which comes unheralded, at an inconvenient time and usually when there is less than ideal support. During the past 15 years, there has been an evolution in the treatment of liver injuries which is exemplified by a non-operative approach in selected patients and more conservative procedures in those who require operative intervention. At present, ?damage control? is in vogue; do the least possible to control life-threatening injuries and come back another day. This is a cogent and admirable philosophy, provided that the pendulum does not swing too far and that a planned course of action is in place. This paper reviews the present status of managing blunt liver injuries, with an emphasis on the general surgeon who has little cause to be involved with surgery of the liver.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reconstruction of joint-crossing digital nerves requires the application of nerve guides with a much higher flexibility than used for peripheral nerve repair along larger bones. Nevertheless, collapse-resistance should be preserved to avoid secondary damage to the regrowing nerve tissue. In recent years, we presented chitosan nerve guides (CNGs) to be highly supportive for the regeneration of critical gap length peripheral nerve defects in the rat. Now, we evidently increased the bendability of regular CNGs (regCNGs) by developing a wavy wall structure, that is, corrugated CNGs (corrCNGs). In a comprehensive in vivo study, we compared both types of CNGs with clinical gold standard autologous nerve grafts (ANGs) and muscle-in-vein grafts (MVGs) that have recently been highlighted in the literature as a suitable alternative to ANGs. We reconstructed rat sciatic nerves over a critical gap length of 15 mm either immediately upon transection or after a delay period of 45 days. Electrodiagnostic measurements were applied to monitor functional motor recovery at 60, 90, 120, and 150 (only delayed repair) days postreconstruction. Upon explanation, tube properties were analyzed. Furthermore, distal nerve ends were evaluated using histomorphometry, while connective tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistological stainings. After 120 days (acute repair) or 150 days (delayed repair), respectively, compression?stability of regCNGs was slightly increased while it remained stable in corrCNGs. In both substudies, regCNGs and corrCNGs supported functional recovery of distal plantar muscles in a similar way and to a greater extent when compared with MVGs, while ANGs demonstrated the best support of regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
