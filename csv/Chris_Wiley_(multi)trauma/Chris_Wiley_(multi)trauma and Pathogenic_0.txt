AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Trauma remains a major cause of death throughout the world, especially for patients younger than 45 years. Due to rapid advances in clinical management, both in the acute and prehospital settings, trauma patients survive devastating injuries at unprecedented rates. However, these patients can often face life threatening complications that stem from the robust innate immune response induced by severe hemorrhage, leading to further tissue injury rather than repair. The complement and coagulation cascades are key mediators in this disordered reaction, which includes the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. There is increasing evidence that cross-talk between these two pathways allows rapid amplification of their otherwise targeted responses and contributes to overwhelming and prolonged systemic inflammation. In this article, we summarize the initial steps of innate immune response to trauma and review the complex complement and coagulation cascades, as well as how they interact with each other. Despite progress in understanding these cascades, effective therapeutic targets have yet to be found and further research is needed both to improve survival rates as well as decrease associated morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Background Evidence suggests that maternal interpersonal trauma can adversely affect offspring health, but little is known about potential transmission pathways. We investigated whether interpersonal trauma exposure had direct and indirect associations with offspring social-emotional development at 12-months of age in an at-risk, home visited population. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 1172 mother-child dyads who participated in a multi-site, early childhood home visiting program. Children were born January 2007 to June 2010 and data were collected at enrolment (prenatal/birth) through 12-months of age. Multivariable path analyses were used to examine the relationship between maternal interpersonal trauma, subsequent psychosocial mediators (maternal depressive symptoms, social support, and home environment), and the outcome of child social-emotional development measured with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE). Maternal interpersonal trauma was characterized as any previous exposure, the level of exposure, and type (e.g. abuse) of exposure. Results The prevalence of maternal interpersonal trauma exposure was 69.1%, and exposures ranged from 1 type (19.3%) to 7 types (2.3%). Interpersonal trauma was associated with a 3.6 point (95% confidence interval 1.8, 5.4) higher ASQ:SE score among offspring and indicated greater developmental risk. An estimated 23.4% of the total effect was mediated by increased maternal depressive symptoms and lower social support. Differential effects were observed by the level and type of interpersonal trauma exposure. Conclusion Maternal interpersonal trauma exposures can negatively impact child social-emotional development, acting in part through maternal psychosocial factors. Future research is needed to further elucidate the mechanisms of intergenerational risk.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Objective To review the guidelines released in the last decade by several organisations for the optimal evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries (renal, ureteric, bladder, urethral and genital). Methods This is a review of the genitourinary trauma guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), and renal trauma guidelines from the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). Results Most recommendations are guided by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity system. Grade A evidence is rare in genitourinary trauma, and most recommendations are based on Grade B or C evidence. The findings of the most recent urological trauma guidelines are summarised. All guidelines recommend conservative management for low-grade injuries. The major difference is for haemodynamically stable patients who have high-grade renal trauma; the SIU guidelines recommend exploratory laparotomy, the EAU guidelines recommend renal exploration only if the injury is vascular, and the AUA guidelines recommend initial conservative management. Conclusion There is generally consensus among the three guidelines. Recommendations are based on observational or retrospective studies, as well as clinical principles and expert opinions. Multi-institutional collaborative research can improve the quality of evidence and direct more effective evaluation and management of urological trauma.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1 mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Background? A balanced transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets are recommended for massively bleeding trauma patients. Fibrinogen concentrates could potentially lessen or replace the need for FFP and/or platelet transfusions. Aim? To provide a review of the literature covering the application of fibrinogen concentrates in trauma care. Methods? PubMed and Cochrane database search: fibrinogen and (concentrate or trauma), not congenital, published between 2000 and 2012. Results? Six papers were identified. None were randomized controlled trials. The main conclusion of these papers was that administration of fibrinogen sometimes together with prothrombin complex concentrate might improve haemostasis in trauma patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Data regarding the effect of fibrinogen concentrate together with a more physiological resuscitation fluid, i.e. FFP, or as the only intervention in bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Conclusions? Evidence for the use of fibrinogen concentrate to trauma patients with massive bleeding is sparse, of poor quality and confined to patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of fibrinogen concentrate, as the only intervention, are urgently needed.

AB  - Summary Soils receive inputs of human pathogenic and indicator bacteria through land application of animal manures or sewage sludge, and inputs by wildlife. Soil is an extremely heterogeneous substrate and contains meso- and macrofauna that may be reservoirs for bacteria of human health concern. The ability to detect and quantify bacteria of human health concern is important in risk assessments and in evaluating the efficacy of agricultural soil management practices that are protective of crop quality and protective of adjacent water resources. The present chapter describes the distribution of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in soils. Methods for detecting and quantifying soilborne bacteria including extraction, enrichment using immunomagnetic capture, culturing, molecular detection and deep sequencing of metagenomic DNA to detect pathogens are overviewed. Methods for strain phenotypic and genotypic characterization are presented, as well as how comparison with clinical isolates can inform the potential for human health risk.

AB  - Abstract Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNALys aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.

AB  - Summary Many clostridial species are ubiquitous in the environment and in the intestinal tracts of birds, fish, and mammals. Commensal species are often carried asymptomatically within a host. However, if the immune status of the host is compromised, due to either age, illness or a change in diet, disease can result from toxigenic strains. Alternatively, some clostridial species or strains don't require predisposing factors. They can cause disease simply if they gain entry into the host either through damage to the skin or through the gastrointestinal tract, often via poorly prepared or incorrectly stored food. These clostridia then overgrow and cause cell and tissue damage. Diseases mediated by the clostridial species discussed in this review are predominantly mediated by potent protein toxins, many of which are located extrachromosomally. These toxins have diverse mechanisms of action and include pore-forming cytotoxins, phospholipases, metalloproteases, ADP-ribosyltransferases and large glycosyltransferases. This review focuses on these toxins and the elements that carry the toxin structural genes. For ease of discussion it has been structured on a bacterial species-specific basis.

AB  - Objectives To describe the CT findings in a population of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma that involved the spleen and liver. Materials and Methods Clinical records between January 2008 and June 2015 were reviewed. Thoracic and abdominal CT examinations of patients diagnosed with multi-centric lymphoma were evaluated by a board-certified radiologist. A diagnosis of multi-centric lymphoma with splenic and hepatic involvement was based upon cytological identification and immunophenotyping of neoplastic lymphocytes in cellular samples harvested from a peripheral lymph node, the spleen and the liver. Results Twelve dogs were included in this study, of which 11 had B-cell lymphoma; immunophenotyping was inconclusive in one dog. The spleen appeared normal in seven dogs and nodules were identified in five dogs. Splenic nodules were hypoattenuating in four of five dogs and isoattenuating in one of five. After contrast administration, three of five appeared hypoattenuating and two of five isoattenuating. The liver appeared normal in 10 dogs and hepatic nodules were identified in two dogs. All hepatic nodules were isoattenuating before contrast and hypoattenuating following contrast administration. Clinical Significance The CT appearance of the spleen and liver was normal in the majority of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration of the spleen and liver is recommended when using CT to stage dogs with multi-centric lymphoma.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD), considered the second most common cause of cognitive impairment after Alzheimer disease in the elderly, involves the impairment of memory and cognitive function as a consequence of cerebrovascular disease. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is a common pathophysiological condition frequently occurring in VaD. It is generally associated with neurovascular degeneration, in which neuronal damage and blood-brain barrier alterations coexist and evoke beta-amyloid?induced oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammasome- promoted neuroinflammation, which contribute to and exacerbate the course of disease. Vascular cognitive impairment comprises a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders of various severity and types that share a presumed vascular etiology. The present study reviews major pathogenic factors involved in VaD, highlighting the relevance of cerebrocellular stress and hormetic responses to neurovascular insult, and addresses these mechanisms as potentially viable and valuable as foci of novel neuroprotective methods to mitigate or prevent VaD. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? Until the late 1960s, splenectomy was routinely performed in children who had sustained blunt splenic injury. There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - Abstract We sought to investigate the risk factors and outcome of Ventilator Associated Tracheitis (VAT) according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition in pediatric trauma patients who were ventilated for ≥48?hr. In a retrospective cohort study, medical records of all pediatric trauma patients admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between April 2002 and April 2007 were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Trauma Injury Severity Score (TISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), type of trauma, and other potential risk factors prior to the development of VAT (such as hyperglycemia, rate of re-intubation and tracheotomy, presence of chest tubes and central lines, urinary tract infection, seizures, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of total parental nutrition, transfusion, use of H2 blockers, steroids, and pressors/inotropes). Medical records were also reviewed for days of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and PICU mortality. During the study period, 217 trauma patients were admitted to the PICU, 113 patients met our inclusion criteria and 21.2% (24/113) developed VAT. On average patients with VAT (in comparison to patients without VAT), had a higher TISS score on admission [38.6?±?16.9 vs. 24.2?±?10.6; respectively (P?<?0.01)], longer days of ventilation and PICU length of stay [11.5?±?6.2 vs. 3.7?±?2.3 days (P?<?0.001) and 16.4?±?8.3 vs. 5.4?±?2.8 days (P?<?0.001), respectively]. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. In a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders, the TISS score (adjusted OR 7.53; CI: 2.01?28.14; P?=?0.03 and use of pressors/inotropes (adjusted OR 4.64; CI: 1.28?16.86; P?=?0.01) were the only independent risk factors associated with VAT. We conclude that the severity of illness and use of pressors/inotropes are associated with VAT in pediatric trauma patients. We also conclude that VAT is associated with an increase in days of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay in pediatric trauma patients.

AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius has been the predominant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolated from canine skin and mucosae and the most commonly reported staphylococcal pathogen in small animal practice for the last 35 years. Although microbiological tests have historically indicated variability in biochemical characteristics amongst S. intermedius isolates from animals, an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy for clinical purposes was readily achievable with routine phenotypic testing. However, three recent developments have changed our understanding of the term ?S. intermedius? and have challenged veterinary bacteriologists to ensure correct species identification of pathogenic staphylococci from small animals. First, the increasing recognition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in small animal practice and its human health implications demand accurate species identification. Secondly, the application of molecular techniques to analysis of staphylococcal isolates has led to a revised taxonomy and canine isolates of S. intermedius being re-named S. pseudintermedius. Thirdly, the recent, rapid emergence of meticillin- and multi-drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a major therapeutic challenge in veterinary practice worldwide, including the UK. This article discusses the background of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Staphylococcus and reviews the key features of MRSP and its implications for day-to-day laboratory diagnosis and small animal practice.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.
