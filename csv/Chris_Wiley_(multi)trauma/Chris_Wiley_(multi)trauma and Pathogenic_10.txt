AB  - Summary Denture stomatitis has been reported in 11?67% of complete denture wearers. It is more common on the palatal mucosa and in female patients. In Newton's type I denture stomatitis, where the inflammation remains focal, trauma seems to be responsible. In Newton's types II and III denture stomatitis, where the denture-bearing mucosa is diffusely involved, most workers assert that the aetiology is multi-factorial. Evidence is presented incriminating Candida albicans colonization of the fitting surface of the prosthesis in many cases of denture stomatitis promoted by continuous denture wearing. Allergic and primary irritant reactions to the denture base material, systemic predisposing factors including dietary deficiency and haematological disorders, also play a part. In most cases of denture stomatitis, elimination of denture faults, control of denture plaque and discontinuous denture wearing are sufficient treatment. The routine use of antiseptic or antimycotic drugs seems unnecessary.

AB  - Background The aim of this study is to identify predisposing factors, the clinical course and visual outcomes in patients with keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation. Methods In a retrospective study, 11 patients with documented keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation and 71 matched controls with uncomplicated surgery were enrolled. Patients were examined for slitlamp findings and corrected distance visual acuity at time of the initial presentation, one month later and six months later. Smears and cultures were provided in all cases. Relevant data in controls were extracted from their medical records, and statistical analysis was done. Results Keratitis onset time ranged from three to 56 days. The incidence was 2.7 per cent over two years. All pathogens were Gram-positive cocci, and the most frequent was Staphylococcus spp. No relationship was found between keratitis occurrence and the ring type or the femtosecond procedure, but the rate of keratitis was higher in patients with the horizontal position of intracorneal ring segments (p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test). All cases were treated with implant explantation and tunnel irrigation with antibiotics. In three cases, amniotic membrane transplantation was performed, and two cases finally underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The final six month corrected distance visual acuity was 0.68 ± 0.35. Poor corrected distance visual acuity improvement was associated with the ulcer size at the first day of the diagnosis (p = 0.011; Spearman's rho). Conclusion The only predisposing factor was the horizontal position of the ring. A careful evaluation in the early post-operative period for any sign of the infiltration would be helpful. Early diagnosis with proper management including fortified antibiotic therapy specifically against Gram-positive cocci and removal of the intracorneal ring seems to result in acceptable visual outcomes in later follow-up. However, a corneal transplant may be the only choice in advanced infectious complications.

AB  - Abstract Transgenic plants offer many advantages, including low cost of production (by elimination of fermenters), storage and transportation; heat stability; and absence of human pathogens. When therapeutic proteins are orally delivered, plant cells protect antigens in the stomach through bioencapsulation and eliminate the need for expensive purification and sterile injections, in addition to development of both systemic and mucosal immunity. Chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, transgene containment via maternal inheritance and multi-gene expression in a single transformation event. Hyper-expression of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague or canine parvovirus (4?31% of total soluble protein, tsp) in transgenic chloroplasts (leaves) or non-green plastids (carrots, tomato), as well as the availability of antibiotic-free selectable markers or the ability to excise selectable marker genes, facilitate oral delivery. Hyper-expression of several therapeutic proteins, including human serum albumin (11.1% tsp), somatotropin (7% tsp), interferon-gamma (6% tsp), anti-microbial peptide (21.5% tsp), facilitates efficient and economic purification. Also, the presence of chaperones and enzymes in chloroplasts facilitate assembly of complex multi-subunit proteins and correct folding of human blood proteins with proper disulfide bonds. Functionality of chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated by several assays, including the macrophage lysis assay, GM1-ganglioside binding assay, protection of HeLa cells or human lung carcinoma cells against encephalomyocarditis virus, systemic immune response, protection against pathogen challenge, and growth or inhibition of cell cultures. Thus, transgenic chloroplasts are ideal bioreactors for production of functional human and animal therapeutic proteins in an environmentally friendly manner.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Abstract Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

AB  - Summary Necropsies were performed on 496 horses that had a fatal injury or illness at a California racetrack during the period February 20th 1990 to March 1st 1992. The primary cause of death was categorised by breed, activity at time of injury or illness and organ system affected. Most of the submissions were Thoroughbred horses (432) and Quarter Horses (46). Most of the injuries occurred while racing (42%) and in training sessions (39%); with fewer non-exercise (12%) and accident (7%) related injuries or illnesses. Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 83% of the Thoroughbred and 80% of the Quarter Horse submissions. The Thoroughbred horses incurred 306 fractures with 263 in the limbs and 90% of those in the forelimbs. The proximal sesamoid bone(s), third metacarpal bone and humerus were the most common bones fractured in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter Horses. Other major causes of death included respiratory, digestive and multi-organ system disorders.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

An analysis of this clinical material shows that those factors related to disturbed relationships within the kibbutz family far outnumber all other pathogenic elements, both in the frequency of their appearance and the severity of their impact. A distinct pattern of family malfunctioning appears to be the most significant pathogenic element ? this despite the centralized caretaking, training, and socializing functions of the kibbutz educators, to whom many tasks ordinarily performed by parents in the traditional family situation, have been delegated.

KW  - Local Antibiotics
KW  - Musculoskeletal Infection (MSKI)
AB  - Abstract Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is broadly used to treat orthopaedic infections based on the rationale that high-dose local delivery is essential to eradicate biofilm-associated bacteria. However, ALBC formulations are empirically based on drug susceptibility from routine laboratory testing, which is known to have limited clinical relevance for biofilms. There are also dosing concerns with non-standardized, surgeon-directed, hand-mixed formulations, which have unknown release kinetics. Based on our knowledge of in vivo biofilms, pathogen virulence, safety issues with non-standardized ALBC formulations, and questions about the cost-effectiveness of ALBC, there is a need to evaluate the evidence for this clinical practice. To this end, thought leaders in the field of musculoskeletal infection (MSKI) met on August 1, 2019 to review and debate published and anecdotal information, which highlighted four major concerns about current ALBC use: 1) substantial lack of Level 1 evidence to demonstrate efficacy; 2) ALBC formulations become subtherapeutic following early release, which risks induction of antibiotic resistance, and exacerbated infection from microbial colonization of the carrier; 3) the absence of standardized formulation protocols, and FDA-approved high-dose ALBC products to use following resection in MSKI treatment; and, 4) absence of a validated assay to determine the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) to predict ALBC efficacy against patient specific microorganisms. Here we describe these concerns in detail, and propose areas in need of research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Anthelmintic resistance is a global problem and constitutes a major threat to the welfare of equids worldwide. The cyathostomins are the most numerous and pathogenic gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) of equids in the developed world. Cyathostomins show widespread resistance to 2 out of 3 of the major classes of anthelmintic and recently there are reports of reduced efficacy to the potent macrocyclic lactones (MLs). None of the 3 novel classes of anthelmintic that have emerged in the last decade are licensed for use in equids. The cysteine proteases (CPs) are plant proteins that have shown potent activity against GINs?in vivo in sheep and pigs. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of the CP papain on cyathostomins in vitro using the egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval migration inhibition test (LMIT). Methods Samples of cyathostomin eggs and third stage larvae were collected and cultured from a population of equids that have recently shown reduced ML efficacy in vivo. The EHA and LMIT were performed on repeated samples with increasing concentrations of papain. Dose?response curves were plotted and PROBIT analysis performed on the data to give EC-50 values (concentration that gives 50% of the maximal response). Results Papain caused a dose dependent inhibition of both egg hatch and larval migration. The EC-50 values were 2??mol/l and 100??mol/l in the EHA and LMIT respectively, indicating a more potent effect on egg hatch. Conclusions The CP papain shows potent anthelmintic activity against cyathostomins in vitro. Good evidence of anthelmintic effect against GINs in other host species is supportive of its potential use in equids. Further work is indicated to evaluate safety and in vivo efficacy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinicopathological and laboratory investigation of horses showing severe neurological signs during the 2010 WNV-lineage 2 human epidemic in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece). Implementation of preventive measures was also addressed. Objectives To describe the clinical signs, supportive treatment and outcome in WNV cases and report the use of an inactivated WNV vaccine used for the protection of horses during the following epidemic periods. Study design Clinical study. Methods Laboratory testing included serology, real-time RT-PCR and histopathology. All affected animals received supportive treatment (furosemide, dexamethasone, B-complex vitamins and NSAIDs). The Equip WNV vaccine was used for immunisation of horses. Results WNV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 17 horses with neurological signs. The specificity of the detected antibodies was confirmed by seroneutralisation tests. The maximum duration of IgM was determined to be 60 days. Clinical signs included weakness of hindlimbs, ataxia and tremors (17/17), altered mental state (10/17), hypersensitivity (7/17), inability to swallow (3/17), recumbency (3/17) and convulsions (3/17). Supportive treatment was successful in 14/17 horses. The 3 recumbent horses died as a result of the infection, or were subjected to euthanasia. Histopathological findings observed in the CNS were mild perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, axonal swelling, glial nodules, microhaemorrhages and neuronal necrosis. None of the vaccinated horses showed clinical signs. Three unvaccinated horses showed clinical signs and developed WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Conclusions The Nea Santa-Greece-lineage 2 strain responsible for the massive human epidemic of 2010 was also highly pathogenic for horses. Timely administration of supportive treatment is important to the prognosis of the cases. WNV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with encephalitis in Greece. Vaccinations can effectively protect horses, especially in areas of Greece where the virus seems to have become endemic.

AB  - Summary:? The discovery of antibodies specific for citrullinated protein epitopes [anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)] is a hallmark for the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and will also be a useful tool for understanding the fundamental pathologic processes. There are several essential questions pertaining to ACPA that remain to be explored, such as understanding the early specificity of the underlying T-cell recognition, whether the production of ACPA is a primary or secondary process, and in the event of such antibodies being arthritogenic, whether they could possibly regulate the disease development. To answer these questions, animal models are needed, but unfortunately ACPA is not a prominent feature of any of the classical animal models of RA. However, we showed recently that ACPA can be isolated from animals susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis that are specific for citrullinated type II collagen (CII). The citrulline specificity could be visualized, and the specificity is determined primarily by a direct interaction with citrulline. We also demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for the citrullinated epitopes and are pathogenic in vivo. A new hypothesis to explain how inflammation in RA can be directed to cartilaginous joints and be self-perpetuating is suggested, which involves recognition of post-translational modifications (glycosylation and citrullination) on CII by T and B cells that can have both arthritogenic and regulatory consequences.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - A growing perception in endodontic circles is that root canal therapy requires one treatment visit only. One-visit endodontics offers many potential advantages. It is less time-consuming, resulting in less cost for the patient, potentially more profit for the dentist, less painful and less traumatic than multi-visit treatment. Conversely, if the pulp is necrotic and/or associated with periradicular disease, the root canal system is infected. In these cases, the root canal system should ideally be cleaned, an intracanal medication placed, and the canal filled at a second visit. In this paper we aim to review several aspects of one-visit versus multi-visit endodontic treatment and future perspectives in this field.

AB  - Introduction Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern with implications for animal health. This study investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal and environmental Escherichia coli isolated from animals sampled in referral hospitals in the UK. Materials and Methods Resistant Escherichia coli isolated from animal faeces and practice environments were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing techniques were used to identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC-producer genotypes. Results In total, 333 faecal and 257 environmental samples were collected. Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli were found in 13·1% of faecal and 8·9% of environmental samples. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC genes were identified 14% and 7·7% of faecal samples and 8·6% and 8·6% of environmental samples, respectively. The most common extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene type detected was blaCTX-M ?15, although blaTEM-158 was detected in faecal and environmental samples from one practice. Clinical Significance Escherichia coli resistant to key antimicrobials were isolated from hospitalised animals and the practice environment. We identified the emergence of the inhibitor resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaTEM-158 in companion animals. Further investigation to determine risk factors for colonisation with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is needed to provide evidence for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes.

AB  - Dementia is a major health problem in developed countries with over 25 million people affected worldwide and probably over 75 million people at risk during the next 20?years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia (50?70%), followed by vascular dementia (30?40%), and mixed dementia (15?20%). AD pathogenesis is still to be elucidated but it is believed to be the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors in later life. Three causative genes for familial AD have been identified: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and presenilin-2. There are 150 genes involved with increased neuronal vulnerability to premature death in the AD brain. Among these susceptibility genes, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is the most prevalent as a risk for AD pathogenic process in which complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are involved, leading to a cascade of pathogenic events converging in final pathways to premature neuronal death. Some of these mechanisms are common to several neurodegenerative disorders that differ depending upon the genes affected and the involvement of environmental conditions. ApoE is a key lipoprotein in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and it is also the major risk gene for AD and many other central nervous system disorders. The pathogenic role of ApoE-4 is still to be clarified; however, diverse evidence suggests that ApoE may play pleiotropic functions in dementia and central nervous system disorders.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Summary Sepsis is characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection that is associated with high morbidity and mortality despite optimal care. Invariant natural killer T (iNK?T) cells are potent regulatory lymphocytes that can produce pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus shaping the course and nature of immune responses; however, little is known about their role in sepsis. We demonstrate here that patients with sepsis/severe sepsis have significantly elevated proportions of iNK?T cells in their peripheral blood (as a percentage of their circulating T cells) compared to non-septic patients. We therefore investigated the role of iNK?T cells in a mouse model of intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). Our data show that iNK?T cells are pathogenic in IAS, and that T helper type 2 (Th2) polarization of iNK?T cells using the synthetic glycolipid OCH significantly reduces mortality from IAS. This reduction in mortality is associated with the systemic elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 and reduction of several proinflammatory cytokines within the spleen, notably interleukin (IL)-17. Finally, we show that treatment of sepsis with OCH in mice is accompanied by significantly reduced apoptosis of splenic T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, but not natural killer cells. We propose that modulation of iNK?T cell responses towards a Th2 phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy in early sepsis.
