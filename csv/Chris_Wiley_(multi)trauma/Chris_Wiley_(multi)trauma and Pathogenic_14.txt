AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - Abstract Although the diagnosis of a diabetic foot infection is made based on clinical symptoms and signs, we also use blood laboratory, microbiological and radiological studies to make treatment decisions. All of these diagnostic studies have pitfalls that can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Such delays will likely lead to further tissue damage and to a higher chance of amputation. One of these pitfalls is that some clinicians rely on microbiological, rather than clinical data, to diagnose infection. Though subjective by nature, clinical signs predict outcome of foot infections accurately. Another pitfall is that microbiological data can be misleading. All wounds harbour microorganisms; therefore, a positive wound culture does not mean that a wound is infected. Furthermore, the outcome of cultures of wound swabs does not correlate well with culture results of tissue biopsies. Therapy guidance by wound swab will likely lead to overtreatment of non-pathogenic organisms. Genotyping might have a role in identifying previously unrecognized (combinations of) pathogens in diabetic foot infection, bacteria in sessile phenotype and non-culturable pathogens, e.g. in cases where antibiotics have already been administered. One more pitfall is that the diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains difficult. Although the result of percutaneous bone biopsy is the reference standard for osteomyelitis, some other diagnostic modalities can aid in the diagnosis. A combination of several of these diagnostic tests is probably a good strategy to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy. Relying on a single test will likely lead to misidentification of patients with osteomyelitis with associated overtreatment and undertreatment. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Objective:? Review the literature regarding the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to prevent red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in critically ill patients. Data sources:? A computerized search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 through June 2003 was conducted using the terms erythropoietin, anemia, hemoglobin, critical care, intensive care, surgery, trauma, burn, and transfusion. References of selected articles were reviewed. A manual search of critical care, surgery, trauma, burn, hematology, and pharmacy journals was conducted to identify relevant abstracts. Results:? Six randomized studies have evaluated exogenous administration of erythropoietin to prevent RBC transfusions in critically ill patients. Studies vary with respect to rHuEPO dosage regimens, dose of concurrently administered iron, patient characteristics, and transfusion thresholds. Administration of rHuEPO rapidly produces erythropoiesis to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. The largest study conducted to date used weekly rHuEPO administration and found a modest decrease in transfusion requirements although the time to first transfusion was delayed. Reduced intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) was shown in only one study of surgical/trauma patients. Reduced LOS after ICU discharge was found in another study of severely ill patients (APACHE II score >22). Other clinical outcomes were not altered by rHuEPO use. No adverse events were associated with rHuEPO use although studies were not designed to evaluate safety. Conclusions:? rHuEPO reduces the need for transfusions. A cost-effectiveness analysis of rHuEPO for this indication is needed. Defining an optimal dosage regimen, identifying patients most likely to respond to rHuEPO, and determining risk factors for ICU associated anaemia would provide information for appropriate rHuEPO utilization.

AB  - Summary Aim Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a growing and largely underestimated problem without defined etiology. Herein, we sought to determine the relationship between cognitive decline, blood?brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and inflammation, namely high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), after surgery in aged rats. Methods Aged rats were randomly assigned as surgery group (n = 45, splenectomy under general anesthesia), anesthesia (n = 45, 2% isoflurane for 2 h), and naïve control (n = 15). Markers of inflammation were measured in plasma and brain. Blood?brain barrier ultrastructure and permeability were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and IgG immunohistochemistry. Cognitive function was assessed in a reversal learning version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Results Surgical trauma under general anesthesia caused distinct changes in systemic and central proinflammatory cytokines. Levels of HMGB1 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of operated animals. Immunohistochemistry and TEM showed BBB disruption induced by surgery and anesthesia. These molecular changes were associated with cognitive impairment in latency with the MWM up to postoperative day 3. Conclusions HMGB1 and RAGE signaling appear pivotal mediators of surgery-induced cognitive decline and may contribute to the changes in BBB permeability after peripheral surgical trauma.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - Summary Guillain?Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, usually monophasic, disorder of the peripheral nervous system that is assumed to be of immune-mediated pathogenesis. However, several clinical features and experimental findings of GBS are uncharacteristic for an immune-mediated disorder and set this condition apart from other disorders with a putative immune-mediated pathogenesis. These features include, among others, the monophasic nature of GBS, the lack of response to immunosuppressive (unlike immunomodulatory) therapy, the absence of a typical association with immunogenetic background and the inability to establish a valid and relevant animal model. We suggest a comprehensive hypothesis for the pathogenesis of GBS that is based on the assumption that the condition is due to a transient (or occasionally chronic) immune deficiency, as in most cases GBS follows an infection with pathogens known to induce immunosuppression. Such infections may be followed by breakdown of immune tolerance and induction of an immune attack on peripheral nerves. Mounting of the immune-mediated assault might be triggered either by the same infective pathogen or by secondary infection. Clearance of the infection and resumption of a normal immune response and tolerance eventually terminate the immune-mediated damage to the peripheral nerves and enable recovery. This hypothesis assumes that the entire sequence of events that culminates in GBS is due to transient exogenous factors and excludes a significant role for inherent host susceptibility, which explains the monophasic nature of the disorder.

AB  - Abstract Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a pest management strategy that incorporates a strategic combination of methods to manage pests without solely relying on chemical pesticides. The goal of a 'successful' IPM program is to produce an economically profitable crop in an ecologically sound manner. IPM was first applied to apple production in the 1970s with the goal of reducing pesticide use while reducing costs to growers. Apple scab is a problem that directly affects fruit as a commodity. Evidence of insects and disease, in addition to anything that impacts fruit finish reduces the value of fruit depending on the severity of the defect and the intended market. Fire blight infections result in the death of flower clusters and terminal shoots; further systemic spread of the pathogen within trees can result in rootstock blight and tree death. The most significant costs associated with fire blight involve tree loss, orchard removal, and replanting costs.

AB  - Summary Colibacillosis refers to any localized or systemic infection caused entirely or partly by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), including colisepticemia, hemorrhagic septicemia, coligranuloma (Hjarre's disease), air sac disease (chronic respiratory disease, CRD), swollen-head syndrome, venereal colibacillosis, coliform cellulitis (inflammatory or infectious process, IP), peritonitis, salpingitis, orchitis, osteomyelitis/ synovitis (including turkey osteomyelitis complex), panophthalmitis, omphalitis/yolk sac infection, and enteritis. Often colibacillosis is among the most frequently reported diseases in surveys of poultry health or condemnations at processing. The etiology of colibacillosis is APEC. Other infectious agents and noninfectious factors usually predispose a bird to infection or contribute to the severity of the disease. Two additional Escherichia species, E. fergusonii and E. albertii, have been isolated from birds and are capable of causing disease or are of public health significance. Escherichia coli possess no unique resistance capabilities and have a susceptibility pattern to chemical and physical agents typical of vegetative, Gram-negative bacteria.

Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 99 dogs. At initial presentation, the most common clinical signs were lethargy (96%), anorexia (88%), vomiting (85%), painful abdomen (39%), diarrhoea (38%), oliguria (27%) and tachypnoea (26%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Abstract Hereditary keratin disorders of the skin and its appendages comprise a large group of clinically heterogeneous disfiguring blistering and ichthyotic diseases, primarily characterized by the loss of tissue integrity, blistering and hyperkeratosis in severely affected tissues. Pathogenic mutations in keratins cause these afflictions. Typically, these mutations in concert with characteristic features have formed the basis for improved disease diagnosis, prognosis and most recently therapy development. Examples include epidermolysis bullosa simplex, keratinopathic ichthyosis, pachyonychia congenita and several other tissue-specific hereditary keratinopathies. Understanding the molecular and genetic events underlying skin dysfunction has initiated alternative treatment approaches that may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for affected patients. Animal and in vitro disease modelling studies have shed more light on molecular pathogenesis, further defining the role of keratins in disease processes and promoting the translational development of new gene and pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Given that the molecular basis for these monogenic disorders is well established, gene therapy and drug discovery targeting pharmacological compounds with the ability to reinforce the compromised cytoskeleton may lead to promising new therapeutic strategies for treating hereditary keratinopathies. In this review, we will summarize and discuss recent advances in the preclinical and clinical modelling and development of gene, natural product, pharmacological and protein-based therapies for these disorders, highlighting the feasibility of new approaches for translational clinical therapy.

From January 2003 to January 2008 1,567 patients with urinary tract infection associated with the use of indwelling urinary catheters were analyzed retrospectively, whose urine specimens were cultured for bacteria and the isolated pathogens were tested for drug sensitivity by Kirby-Baue method. 376 pathogens were isolated from the 1,567 urine specimens (24·0%), most of which were Gram-negative bacteria. The extended spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) rate was 59·8% (79/132) for Escherichia coli and 47·4% (18/38) for Klebsiella pnuemoniae. The isolating rate of Methcillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Methcillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was 54·7% and 88·2% respectively. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria of multi-drug resistance. Use of antibiotics should be based on drug sensitivity tests.

AB  - Abstract Epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is a descriptive term for a group of severe epilepsy disorders characterised predominantly by early onset drug-resistant seizures, accompanied by developmental stagnation or regression secondary to epileptiform activity. The aetiological diagnosis of EE is challenging, as causes are numerous with significant phenotypic overlap: these include acquired causes as well as numerous de novo or inherited monogenic seizure disorders, genetic inborn errors of metabolism, intellectual disability syndromes and chromosomal aberrations. A diagnostic pathway should include consultation with a Paediatric Neurologist and Clinical Geneticist, screening for immediately treatable causes, neuroimaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) and genetic testing including chromosomal microarray and consideration of a next generation sequencing technique that can interrogate multiple genetic causes, such as a multigene panel, or exome/genome sequencing. Understanding the underlying genetic cause of EE can allow accurate genetic counselling for the family and providing personalised management and support. Key Concepts EE is a descriptive term for a group of disorders where epileptiform activity itself contributes to severe cognitive and behavioural impairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology. Although EE can be acquired, most cases of previously considered cryptogenic EE are now recognised to be due to single gene disorders. The majority of monogenic EE are due to de novo pathogenic variants: however, up to 10% of EE may be due to X-linked or autosomal recessive conditions, with higher rates in populations where consanguineous marriage is more common. Although there are some genotype/phenotype correlations, a single genetic cause can result in a variety of EE and non-EE phenotypes, and each subtype of EE can have a variety of genetic causes. Genetic heterogeneity in EE limits the value of targeted genetic testing. An optimal, cost-effective diagnostic approach involves first-tier tests that target common and treatable conditions, followed by second-tier tests including sequencing of a panel of genes known to cause EE or exome/whole genome sequencing to allow genome-wide interrogation. Factors influencing choice of type of genetic test (multigene panel versus exome/genome sequencing) include epilepsy semiology, developmental regression, additional neurological or extra-cerebral manifestations, family history and clinician and patient choice and cost. Phenotypic factors that suggest exome/genome sequencing may be valuable and include developmental regression and progressive features, multiorgan involvement including dysmorphism, additional neurological features and cerebral malformations. Evaluation of the likely pathogenicity of a novel genetic variant should include consideration of similarity with the types of genetic variants previously identified as causal of EE for that gene, including which functional domain(s) are implicated as well as overlap with the associated clinical features previously described for that condition. For variants remaining of uncertain clinical significance, ongoing pathogenicity assessment will be required in the light of advances in the understanding of the genetics of EE.

Resulting cell population fluorescence supported visualization of cell-surface protein distribution by confocal microscopy, as well as evaluation of protein exposure by flow cytometry and the calculation of the ligand-binding determinants EC50, Fmax and Hn. Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins also supported their isolation by affinity chromatography and characterization by SDS/PAGE. Ligand-binding determinants, such as EC50 values, indicated that acapsulate and stationary phase cells have greatest affinity for biotin. Fmax values demonstrated greatest protein exposure among stationary phase cells; in turn, encapsulated cells expose more protein than acapsulate counterparts. Hn values of below unity potentially confirm the complex multi-receptor nature of biotin binding to cryptococcal cell surfaces under investigation. Fluorescence visualization showed marked but localized fluorescence indicative of protein exposure around sites of cell division. In turn, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins and their release under reducing conditions demonstrated at least two noncovalently linked proteinaceous entities, of 43 and 57?kDa, exposed on acapsulate cryptococcal cell walls. Conclusions:? A novel method for identifying, in situ, cell-surface proteins exposed by C. neoformans was established. This novel technique was successfully implemented using both acapsulate and encapsulated C. neoformans cells, both were found to have dynamic and markedly localized protein distribution around sites of cell division and associated cell wall trauma. Significance and Impact of the Study:? A novel procedure, employing a versatile combination of flow cytometry, ligand-receptor analysis, confocal microscopy and biotinylation, supported the characterization and isolation of cryptococcal cell-surface proteins.

AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

AB  - Summary Direct molecular evidence of the presence of infectious microbes in human archaeological material has proved a fruitful but very controversial field of study. The great majority of published findings are based upon the direct detection of ancient DNA of pathogenic microorganisms, and even now there are those who doubt the authenticity of data. A good understanding of the natural history of the infectious agent and of its interaction with the human host is necessary. Practical problems arise unless the likely site in the body of any biomolecular traces of the microbe is known, and the relationship to the stage of the disease. This is entirely separate from the vexed question of the preservation of microbial biomolecules in comparison with those of their human host. General principles for undertaking this biomolecular work are described and likely developments indicated. The strategies adopted by particular groups of infectious microbes are outlined and the accumulated body of knowledge in relation to specific diseases is updated or reviewed. Finally, the interaction with the expanding field of microbial genomics is mentioned and the co-evolution of infectious agents and their human hosts is considered.

AB  - Abstract The Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo has been housing and breeding slender-tailed cloud rats (Phleomys pallidus) since 1985. Records of 82 animals from 1985 to 2013 were reviewed for this study. The animals were kept successfully in small family groups with a single adult male, multiple adult females, and their offspring. Sexual maturity was noted at approximately 2 years of age and gestation length ranged from 52 to 55 days. Animals were fed a diet including a complete commercial pelleted feed, mixed greens, carrot or yam, mixed hard nuts, and locally sourced browse. Medical conditions requiring treatment in neonates were often fatal whereas most medical conditions in adults were survivable. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates was maternal neglect or trauma (42%, 5/12 antemortem problems; cause of death in 32%, 8/25). The most significant problems in adults were cryptococcal pneumonia and trauma. Cryptococcus sp. was the cause of death in 11 cases (34%, 11/32) and significant comorbidity in an additional three cases. Treatment with antifungal medications was attempted but was unsuccessful in four cases. Many cases of trauma were treated successfully with conservative management or limited intervention. In four cases, treatment was complicated by extensive self-mutilation after surgical repair of traumatic lesions, which resulted in death or euthanasia. Lymphoplasmacytic thyroiditis was a common postmortem finding in adults (95%, 21/22 for which the thyroid gland was examined histologically). It is unclear if thyroiditis resulted in functional hypothyroidism so the significance of this finding is undetermined.

AB  - Abstract The advent of antibiotics revolutionized the medical care resulting in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. However, excessive use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance and indeed, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is considered as a major disadvantage in the medication strategy, which led the scholar?s attention toward innovative antibiotic sources in recent years. Medicinal plants contained a variety of secondary metabolites with a wide range of therapeutic potential against the resistant microbes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the antibacterial potential of traditional herbal medicine against bacterial infections. About more than 200 Published research articles reporting the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against drug resistant microbial infections were searched using different databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) etc. with various keywords like Medicinal plants having antibacterial activities, antimicrobial potentials, phytotherapy of bacterial infection etc., and articles were selected related to the efficacious herbs easily available to local population addressing common pathogens. Various plants such as Artocarpus communis, Rheum emodi, Gentiana lutea L., Cassia fistula L., Rosemarinus officinalis, Argemone maxicana L, Hydrastis canadensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Cymbopogon citrates, Carica papaya, Euphorbia hirta etc. were found to have significant antibacterial activities. Although, herbal preparations have promising potential in the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infection, but still, more research is required to isolate phytoconstituents, their mechanism of action as well as to find their impacts on human body.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.
