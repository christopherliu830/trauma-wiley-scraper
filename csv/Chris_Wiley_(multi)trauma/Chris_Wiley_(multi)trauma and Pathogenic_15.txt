AB  - Abstract The advent of antibiotics revolutionized the medical care resulting in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. However, excessive use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance and indeed, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is considered as a major disadvantage in the medication strategy, which led the scholar?s attention toward innovative antibiotic sources in recent years. Medicinal plants contained a variety of secondary metabolites with a wide range of therapeutic potential against the resistant microbes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the antibacterial potential of traditional herbal medicine against bacterial infections. About more than 200 Published research articles reporting the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against drug resistant microbial infections were searched using different databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) etc. with various keywords like Medicinal plants having antibacterial activities, antimicrobial potentials, phytotherapy of bacterial infection etc., and articles were selected related to the efficacious herbs easily available to local population addressing common pathogens. Various plants such as Artocarpus communis, Rheum emodi, Gentiana lutea L., Cassia fistula L., Rosemarinus officinalis, Argemone maxicana L, Hydrastis canadensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Cymbopogon citrates, Carica papaya, Euphorbia hirta etc. were found to have significant antibacterial activities. Although, herbal preparations have promising potential in the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infection, but still, more research is required to isolate phytoconstituents, their mechanism of action as well as to find their impacts on human body.

AB  - Summary Treatment for vitiligo is difficult and prolonged. Nevertheless, at present considerable knowledge accumulated during several decades on the pathogenic mechanisms, revealed important clues for designing new strategies to improve vitiligo depigmentation. With available medical therapies, high repigmentation percentages mostly on facial and neck lesions are achieved, although they are less effective on trunk and limbs and poor on the acral parts of the extremities. Narrow band UVB and psoralens and UVA are the two most important treatments for generalized vitiligo affecting more than 10?20% of the cutaneous surface, and topical corticosteroids, or calcineurin inhibitors are the most valuable treatments for localized vitiligo. Persistence of achieved regimentation is variable and an undefined percentage of patients may have variable recurrence. When vitiligo becomes refractory, surgical methods may improve depigmentation as effectively as with medical therapy; in segmental (unilateral) or long standing, non-segmental (bilateral) stable vitiligo, repigmentation with surgical methods is usually permanent.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA is a neuronopathic lysosomal storage disease, characterised by heparan sulphate and other substrates accumulating in the brain. Patients develop behavioural disturbances and cognitive decline, a possible consequence of neuroinflammation and abnormal substrate accumulation. Interleukin (IL)-1? and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression were significantly increased in both murine models and human MPSIII patients. We identified pathogenic mechanisms of inflammasome activation, including that disease-specific 2-O-sulphated heparan sulphate was essential for priming an IL-1? response via the Toll-like receptor 4 complex. However, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA primary and secondary storage substrates, such as amyloid beta, were both required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate IL-1? secretion. IL-1 blockade in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice using IL-1 receptor type 1 knockout or haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy over-expressing IL-1Ra reduced gliosis and completely prevented behavioural phenotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1 drives neuroinflammation, behavioural abnormality and cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA, highlighting haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy treatment with IL-1Ra as a potential neuronopathic lysosomal disease treatment.

AB  - The integrity of human skin is central to the prevention of infection. Acute and chronic wounds can develop when the integrity of skin as a barrier to infection is disrupted. As a multi-functional organ, skin possesses important biochemical and physical properties that influence its microbiology. These properties include a slightly acidic pH, a low moisture content, a high lipid content (which results in increased hydrophobicity) and the presence of antimicrobial peptides. Such factors have a role to play in preventing exogenous microbial colonisation and subsequent infection. In addition, the properties of skin both select for and enhance colonisation and biofilm formation by certain ?beneficial? micro-organisms. These beneficial micro-organisms can provide further protection against colonisation by potential pathogens, a process known as colonisation resistance. The aim of this paper is to summarise the microflora of skin and wounds, highlighting the role of certain micro-organisms and biofilms in associated infections.

AB  - ABSTRACT Of the various virulence mechanisms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type III secretion system (TTSS) has been characterized as a major factor associated with acute lung injury, bacteremia and mortality. In addition, PcrV, a component protein of the TTSS, has been characterized as a protective antigen against infection with P. aeruginosa. This study comprised an epidemiological analysis of serum anti-PcrV titers in a cohort of Japanese adults. From April 2012 to March 2013, serum anti-PcrV titers of 198 volunteer participants undergoing anesthesia for scheduled surgeries were measured. The median, minimum and maximum serum anti-PcrV titers among the 198 participants were 4.09?nM, 1.01?nM and 113.81?nM, respectively. The maximum peaks in the histogram were within the anti-PcrV 2.00?4.99?nM titer range; values for 115 participants (58.1%) were within this range. Anti-PcrV titers were more than approximately three-fold greater (>12?nM) than the median value in 21 participants (10.6%). Ten-year interval age increases, history of treatment for traffic trauma, and a history of past surgery each showed statistically significant associations with higher anti-PcrV titers (i.e., >10?nM) than did the other factors assessed by binomial analysis. This study revealed a considerable variation in anti-PcrV titers in adult subjects without any obvious histories of infection with P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Abstract The 1555 A to G substitution in mitochondrial 12S A-site rRNA is associated with maternally transmitted deafness of variable penetrance in the absence of otherwise overt disease. Here, we recapitulate the suggested A1555G-mediated pathomechanism in an experimental model of mitoribosomal mistranslation by directed mutagenesis of mitoribosomal protein MRPS5. We first establish that the ratio of cysteine/methionine incorporation and read-through of mtDNA-encoded MT-CO1 protein constitute reliable measures of mitoribosomal misreading. Next, we demonstrate that human HEK293 cells expressing mutant V336Y MRPS5 show increased mitoribosomal mistranslation. As for immortalized lymphocytes of individuals with the pathogenic A1555G mutation, we find little changes in the transcriptome of mutant V336Y MRPS5 HEK cells, except for a coordinated upregulation of transcripts for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. Homozygous knock-in mutant Mrps5 V338Y mice show impaired mitochondrial function and a phenotype composed of enhanced susceptibility to noise-induced hearing damage and anxiety-related behavioral alterations. The experimental data in V338Y mutant mice point to a key role of mitochondrial translation and function in stress-related behavioral and physiological adaptations.

AB  - The late endosomal adaptor protein LAMTOR2/p14 is essential for tissue homeostasis by controlling MAPK and mTOR signaling, which in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation, migration and spreading. Moreover, LAMTOR2 critically controls architecture and function of the endocytic system, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in lysosomes, positioning of late endosomes and defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we describe the multifaceted ultrastructural phenotype of the endo/lysosomal system of LAMTOR2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Quantitative (immuno-)electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples revealed significantly reduced numbers of recycling tubules emanating from maturing multivesicular bodies (MVB). Instead, a distinct halo of vesicles surrounded MVB, tentatively interpreted as detached, jammed recycling tubules. These morphological changes in LAMTOR2-deficient cells correlated with the presence of growth factors (e.g. EGF), but were similarly induced in control cells by inactivating mTOR. Furthermore, proper transferrin receptor trafficking and recycling were apparently dependent on an intact LAMTOR complex. Finally, a severe imbalance in the relative proportions of endo/lysosomes was found in LAMTOR2-deficient cells, resulting from increased amounts of mature MVB and (autophago)lysosomes. These observations suggest that the LAMTOR/Ragulator complex is required not only for maintaining the homeostasis of endo/lysosomal subpopulations but also contributes to the proper formation of MVB-recycling tubules, and regulation of membrane/cargo recycling from MVB.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Abstract:? Lipoid proteinosis (OMIM 247100), also known as Urbach?Wiethe disease or hyalinosis cutis et mucosae, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized thickening and scarring of the skin and mucosae. In 2002, the disorder was mapped to a locus on chromosome 1q21 and pathogenic mutations were identified in the ECM1 gene, which encodes for the glycoprotein extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1). ECM1 has since been shown to have several important biological functions. It has a role in the structural organization of the dermis (binding to perlecan, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and fibulin) as well as being targeted as an autoantigen in the acquired disease lichen sclerosus. ECM1 also shows over-expression in certain malignancies and is abnormally expressed in chronologically aged and photo-aged skin. Thus far, 26 different inherited mutations in ECM1 have been reported in lipoid proteinosis. In this article, we provide an update on the molecular pathology of lipoid proteinosis, including the addition of 15 new mutations in ECM1 to the mutation database, and review the biological functions of the ECM1 protein in health and disease.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To report the anatomical pattern and etiological spectrum of uveitis in an urban multi-ethnic population from Barcelona, Spain. General and specific epidemiological data for the most prevalent aetiologies are also calculated. Methods A cross-sectional study of consecutive uveitis cases was performed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. Exogenous endophthalmitis, surgery-related, post-traumatic and toxic uveitis along with masquerade syndromes were excluded. Anatomical (Standard Uveitis Nomenclature criteria) and aetiological patterns (by tailored tests), age, sex, geographical origin and laterality were analysed. Mean incidence and prevalence were calculated for a mid-period reference population. Results From 1022 patients included, 52% were anterior uveitis (AU), 23% posterior, 15% panuveitis and 9% intermediate uveitis. Aetiologically, 26% were unclassifiable, 29% infectious, 25% associated with systemic immune diseases, and 20% corresponded to ocular-specific syndromes. Among classified causes, herpesvirus (12%), toxoplasma (7%), Beh√ßet's disease (BD) (5%), HLA-B27-isolated AU (5%), ankylosing spondylitis (5%), tuberculosis-related uveitis (TRU) (5%), birdshot chorioretinopathy (3%) and sarcoidosis (3%) were the most frequent. Non-Spanish origin was recorded in 22%, with 47% of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada and 36% of toxoplasma cases coming from South America, 10% of BD and 11% of TRU from Africa and 24% of TRU cases from Asia. A mean annual incidence of 51.91 cases/100¬†000 inhabitants was found for the referral population. Conclusion In our referral area, 74% of the uveitis cases can be correctly classified. A large myriad of uveitis aetiologies with a strong geographical origin burden are found in Western urban multi-ethnic populations.

Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n¬†=¬†25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00¬†¬±¬†4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00¬†¬±¬†16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p¬†<¬†0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p¬†<¬†0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p¬†<¬†0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - Summary Bacterial infections associated with multidrug resistance are among the leading causes of death and represent a major threat to the human health of the new millennium. Several pathogenic bacteria have become resistant to several antibiotic classes, and strains resistant to all available antibiotics already exist. Therefore, in an era of the rise of multidrug-resistant superbugs, and where solutions are becoming scarce, there is an urgent need to find alternative and effective antibacterial agents. Bacteriophages, the viruses of microbes, due to their bacterial predatory nature represent a natural toolbox on promising antibacterial proteins. Here, we describe the most promising proteins (virion-associated lysins [VALs], endolysins, polysaccharide depolymerases, and holins) that can be used to treat bacterial infections, including those associated with high antibiotic resistance. The biological features and studies that demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of these enzymes on pathogens are demonstrated. The VALs and endolysins are enzymes with the ability to degrade the bacterial peptidoglycan (thereby compromising and lysing the cells) and are the most well-studied phage proteins with several successful studies reported in vitro and in vivo. There are however other promising phage-derived enzymes that target bacteria with a different mode of action. Polysaccharide depolymerases do not kill bacteria, but instead degrade their extracellular polymers that protect the cells from the environment. They have been found to be particularly useful to control bacterial infections in cooperation with the host immune system. Finally, the holins are also emerging as a new class of antibacterials. These enzymes permeabilize the inner bacterial membranes making holes on them, and although only few reports have demonstrated its antibacterial activity, their potential use as therapeutic agents is expected to be high. This chapter demonstrates the hidden antimicrobial potential of the phage proteome, with specific examples of phage-derived proteins that can be used to control drug-resistant bacterial infections.

AB  - Abstract The genome of the yeast Candida albicans harbours many genomic short sequence repeats (SSRs). These are stable upon transition of colonization to infection in immune-compromised patients. We show here that in non-neutropenic patients this transition may coincide with variation in several of the SSRs. This may have implications for stage-specific expression of C. albicans pathogenicity factors. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - Summary Infectious disease is the result of the invasion of a host by a pathogenic organism. The continued survival of infectious agents, with or without the induction of disease, depends on their successful transmission to a susceptible host, the instigation of an infection therein and replication of the agents to maintain the cycle of infection. The complete cycle of infection of an infectious agent is its life-cycle. The knowledge of the life-cycle of an infectious agent is essential when selecting the most applicable control technique. This involves knowledge of: the modes of transmission and maintenance of infection; the ecological conditions that favour the survival and transmission of infectious agents. Transmission may be either horizontal (lateral) or vertical. The variety of terms describe the range of host/parasite relationships, and are used by the epidemiologist, pro-tozoologist, entomologist, helminthologist and microbiologist. A host's susceptibility (vulnerability) and infectiousness determine its ability to transmit infection.

AB  - Abstract Allogeneic portal vein (PV) grafts have been widely used for vascular reconstruction in the aggressive biliary-pancreatic surgery and partial liver transplantation. We developed a novel PV transplantation model aimed at studying the pathologic alteration of the grafts and further managements. The PV graft was implanted orthotopically into the recipient using two-cuff technique. A total of 80 PV transplants have been performed, and the overall survival rate for the recipients was 91.3% (73/80). Mice were randomly separated into isografts group, allografts group, and allografts group treated with CTLA4-Ig. PV grafts were harvested on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 8th postoperative week. The isografts remained intact vascular structure, and the allografts developed marked rejection with significant increase in wall thickness (95 ¬± 19 ?m vs. 49 ¬± 7 ?m; P < 0.01) and decrease in lumen area (1.9 ¬± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 7.7 ¬± 3.1 ? 104 ?m2; P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In the CTLA4-Ig treated group, the vascular thickness and lumen area were significantly improved when compared with the untreated allografts (wall-thickness: 53 ¬± 3 ?m vs. 95 ¬± 19 ?m, P < 0.01; lumen area: 8.8 ¬± 2.4 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 1.9 ¬± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2, P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In conclusion, the PV transplantation model in mice using two-cuff technique is a feasible procedure with a high survival rate. The PV allografts responded well to the CTLA4-Ig therapy in our preliminary research by the model. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2007.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C.¬†psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C.¬†psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C.¬†psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36¬†h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C.¬†psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C.¬†psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - The avian lung shows fundamental differences to its mammalian counterpart and is characterized by a larger surface area and a thinner gas-blood barrier. These features provide the morphological basis for the enhanced respiratory efficiency of the avian lung. However, they also predispose this organ to an increased risk of injury by pathogenic microorganisms. In order to investigate the host?pathogen interaction during pulmonary infection and vaccine delivery by aerosol immunization a detailed knowledge of the structure and ontogenesis of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is required. For this reason the BALT of chickens aged from 1?day to 6?months was studied by immunohistochemistry (ICC), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as by FACS analysis. During the first 2?weeks after hatching no organized lymphatic structures were found. At this time, the defence system was based on the presence of cells of the unspecific innate immune system. In the third week after hatching lymphoid follicles begin to develop at the branching of primary and secondary bronchi. These develop into a highly organized bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) characterized by high endothelial venules and a follicle associated epithelium (FAE) with ?M-cell-like? cells. However, pathogens that have successfully crossed this initial barrier are additionally confronted with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages distributed around the parabronchi. Our results imply that the BALT is the first and most important structure encountering antigen and microbial pathogens, thus playing a central role in the initiation of a specific immune response.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of cefovecin in the treatment of bacterial skin infections in dogs. Method: Dogs with superficial or deep pyoderma or wounds/abscesses were enrolled in three separate studies. Dogs (354) were randomised to treatment and received either cefovecin administered by subcutaneous injection at 14 day intervals, as clinically necessary, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as oral tablets twice daily for 14 days. Courses of treatment were repeated at 14 day intervals up to a total of four courses. Clinicians responsible for assessing lesions were masked to treatment allocation. Only animals where the presence of a pretreatment bacterial pathogen was confirmed were included in the analysis of efficacy. Cases were evaluated for clinical efficacy at 28 days after initiation of the final course of treatment. Clinical efficacy was assessed by scoring the clinical signs typical of skin infections. Results: Cefovecin demonstrated statistical non-inferiority compared with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for all three clinical diagnoses; for cefovecin, up to 96¬∑9 per cent efficacy was observed versus 92¬∑5 per cent for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical Significance: Cefovecin was shown to be as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid administered orally in the treatment of bacterial skin infections in dogs. Cefovecin offers the additional benefit of eliminating owner non-compliance.
