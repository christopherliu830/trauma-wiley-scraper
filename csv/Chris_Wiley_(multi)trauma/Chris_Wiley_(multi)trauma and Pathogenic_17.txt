AB  - Abstract? Denture stomatitis is a common recurring problem of the denture wearers. The aetiology of the disease includes infection, trauma and probably a defect in the host defence mechanism. Current thinking suggests an interplay of most of these factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. The extent of interplay of these factors is still a controversy. Candida albicans has been implicated as the causative organism. However, in the light of recent research it is debatable if it is the only causative organism. Recently, cases resistant to antifungal therapy have been reported. In such cases other micro-organisms have been isolated. At the moment, comprehensive management includes meticulous denture hygiene together with anti-fungal or antibacterial therapy and correction of denture faults.

AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - Abstract A risk ranking process identified Salmonella spp. and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) as current high-priority biological hazards for meat inspection of bovine animals. As these hazards are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system for the farm-to-chilled carcass continuum using a risk-based approach was proposed. Key elements of the system are risk-categorisation of slaughter animals for high-priority biological hazards based on improved food chain information, as well as risk-categorisation of slaughterhouses according to their capability to control those hazards. Omission of palpation and incision during post-mortem inspection for animals subjected to routine slaughter may decrease spreading and cross-contamination with the high-priority biological hazards. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern; all other substances were ranked as of medium or lower concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account the completeness and quality of the food chain information supplied and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated to include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control programmes, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for bovine tuberculosis and would have a negative impact on the overall surveillance system especially in officially tuberculosis free countries. The detection effectiveness for bovine cysticercosis, already low with the current meat inspection system, would result in a further decrease, if palpation and incision are removed. Extended use of food chain information could compensate for some, but not all, the information on animal health and welfare lost if only visual post-mortem inspection is applied.

AB  - Abstract Surgical site infections (SSI) are infectious complications that manifest at the incision site of a surgical patient, and are the result of a combination of host, pathogen, and environmental factors resulting in the establishment of infection. Because of the high prevalence of cruciate ligament rupture, and the popularity of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO), more studies have focused on this procedure than on any other stifle procedure. Extracapsular techniques for cruciate ligament stabilization have generally been associated with a lesser risk of infection. Even though SSI can occur up to a year postoperatively, most infections are diagnosed within the first couple of months after surgery. Radiographic signs of infection are generally mild and non-specific unless the infection is severe and chronic. Infections associated with the implant that develops after bone consolidation is often treated by implant removal, followed by a short course of antibiotics.

AB  - Abstract Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRm) causes a disabling peripheral neuropathy as part of a multisystem disorder. The recent development of highly effective gene silencing therapies has highlighted the need for effective biomarkers of disease activity to guide the decision of when to start and stop treatment. In this study, we measured plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) concentration in 73 patients with ATTR and found that pNfL was significantly raised in ATTRm patients with peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, pNFL correlated with disease severity as defined by established clinical outcome measures in patients for whom this information was available. These findings suggest a potential role of pNfL in monitoring disease activity and progression in ATTRm patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the utility of using manipulations in experimental animals to model cognitive deficits and affective dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. It briefly illustrates the usefulness of three key types of validity. Construct validity is arguably critical in the rational development of animal models of psychiatric disorders. The chapter reviews selected behavioral paradigms that have proven useful in modeling the pathogenesis of abnormalities occurring at the earliest and most advanced levels of cognition in schizophrenia. Threat detection, fear-related behaviors, reward processing, incentive, and social drive comprise an interactive cluster of 'affective' constructs relevant to all psychiatric disorders, but especially anxiety and mood disorders. Animal models of the neural substrates of fear and conflict behavior have been central to the search for pathogenic neural processes and molecules for anxiety disorders. The chapter highlights that animal models have heuristic value for developing new hypotheses about the nature and causation of mental disorders.

AB  - As is well known, Freud described the clinical practice of psychoanalysis as the ?loam? of his cultural-theoretical work, an assessment which is shared by many psychoanalysts up to the present, including the authors of this paper. The complex interplay between unconscious phantasies on the one hand, and the real experiences arising from the new possibilities opened up by prenatal diagnostics on the other, is described with reference to a report of an intensive, long psychoanalysis with an analysand from a family burdened with a genetically transmitted illness (haemophilia). The holding and containing function of the analyst enabled this analysand, despite traumatic experiences with the miscarriage of a healthy child triggered by a prenatal diagnosis and the later abortion of a haemophiliac baby, nevertheless to have the courage to go through another pregnancy and give birth to a healthy girl. The intensive clinical investigation of the unconscious phantasies, conflicts and traumas around the prenatal diagnostics proved to be not only therapeutically fruitful for the analysand, Ms F. It also facilitated insights into those individual chances and risks which appear to be an integral part of the opportunities presented by todays prenatal diagnostics and, through them, it lead to a cultural-critical look at the ambivalence of medical-technical progress. These insights, which are only attainable through psychoanalysis, can represent a distinctive contribution of psychoanalysis to a multi-disciplinary dialogue with medical practitioners, geneticists, ethicists and health policy-makers. By referring to a large EU study on ?Ethical Dilemmas due to Prenatal and Genetic Diagnostics?, this paper gives a practical example of such a discussion. Ms F. was psychoanalytically interviewed as part of this study, 16 years after the conclusion of her analysis. The summary of these interviews, which is set against the account of the treatment, offers an impressive insight not only into the long-term effects of a psychoanalysis under very particular personal circumstances, but also into the lasting consequences of decisions made in the context of prenatal diagnostics. Finally, the results of the individual case study are brought together with the clinical outcomes of the EU study, and some considerations are formulated concerning the protective and risk factors facing women during and after prenatal diagnostics. The paper is an appeal to psychoanalysts, with their specific competence in dealing with unconscious phantasies and conflicts and their high level of professionalism in dealing with traumatised patients, to get involved in fresh dialogue with prenatal diagnosticians and their patients.

AB  - Abstract Glomerular crescents are most common in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis but also occur in non-inflammatory chronic glomerulopathies; thus, factors other than inflammation should trigger crescent formation, eg vascular damage and plasma leakage. Here we report that Alport nephropathy in Col4A3-deficient Sv129 mice is complicated by diffuse and global crescent formation in which proliferating parietal epithelial cells are the predominant cell type. Laminin staining and transmission and acellular scanning electron microscopy of acellular glomeruli documented disruptions and progressive disintegration of the glomerular basement membrane in Col4A3-deficient mice. FITC-dextran perfusion further revealed vascular leakage from glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space, further documented by fibrin deposits in the segmental crescents. Its pathogenic role was validated by showing that the fibrinolytic activity of recombinant urokinase partially prevented crescent formation. In addition, in vitro studies confirmed an additional mitogenic potential of serum on murine and human parietal epithelial cells. Furthermore, loss of parietal cell polarity and unpolarized secretion of extracellular matrix components were evident within fibrocellular crescents. Among 665 human Alport nephropathy biopsies, crescent formation was noted in 0.4%. We conclude that glomerular vascular injury and GBM breaks cause plasma leakage which triggers a wound healing programme involving the proliferation of parietal cells and their loss of polarity. This process can trigger cellular and fibrocellular crescent formation even in the absence of cellular inflammation and rupture of the Bowman's capsule.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) differs from S. epidermidis isolated from normal flora in terms of its capacity to induce activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1? in human neutrophils. The amount of active caspase-1 was determined over 6 h by detecting Ac-YVAD-AMC fluorescence in human neutrophils incubated with S. epidermidis isolates from PJIs (ST2) or normal flora. The amount of IL-1? was detected by ELISA in neutrophil supernatants after 6 h of incubation. Mean IL-1? release was lower after incubation with S. epidermidis from PJIs compared to isolates from normal flora, but no statistically significant difference was found in active caspase-1. Substantial inter-individual differences in both active caspase-1 and IL-1? were noted. These results suggest that evasion of innate immune response, measured as reduced capacity to induce release of IL-1? from human neutrophils, might be involved in the predominance of ST2 in S. epidermidis PJIs, but that other microbe-related factors are probably also important.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of vascular diseases of the liver. Several rare diseases are included within this term, the most important being Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), portal vein thrombosis (PVT), sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and adaptation to heterogenous perfusion. BCS and PVT are mainly caused by prothrombotic diseases and they frequently develop non-cirrhotic portal hypertension-related complications. SOS is caused most often by drugs and chemotherapy regimens and its clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe hepatic and multiorgan failure. The term adaptation to heterogenous perfusion includes a variety of rare entities such as nodular regenerative hyperplasia, hepatoportal sclerosis, non-cirrhotic portal cirrhosis, and obliterative portal venopathy, suggesting that they could constitute a single entity with a common pathogenic mechanism that results in a spectrum of pathological lesions and clinical manifestations. This chapter also considers ischemic hepatitis, congestive hepatopathy and peliosis hepatis.

She had global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, nystagmus and tremor in her upper extremities. Metabolic investigations demonstrated elevations in plasma methionine, plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), with normal urine adenosine levels. Some of the elevations persisted for over 1?year. Sequencing of the ADK and AHCY genes was negative for causative variants. Plasma methionine normalized 1?year after ascertainment, but SAM and SAH continued to be elevated for six more months before normalization, and aminotransferases remained mildly elevated. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant; NM_018297.3(NGLY1):c.1405C>T (p.Arg469*) in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene, for which both parents were heterozygous. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NGLY1 deficiency with elevations in plasma methionine, SAM and SAH and a slight elevation of tHcy. Less than 20 patients have been reported with NGLY1 deficiency worldwide and this case expands on the biochemical phenotype of this newly discovered inborn error of metabolism.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar abortus equi (S. abortus equi) is well known as the aetiological agent of equine abortion. However, abortion caused by S. abortus equi has not been previously described in donkeys. Objectives To investigate whether S. abortus equi was correlated with an abortion outbreak consisting of 61 abortions. Study design Investigation of the clinical cases using pathoanatomical, bacteriological, serological and molecular approaches. Methods Autopsies on nine aborted foetuses were performed. Tissue specimens from seven aborted foetuses and two mares were cultured and subjected to detection of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1), equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) by polymerase chain reaction. The isolates were serotyped according to the Kaufmann?White scheme and analysed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Detection of EHV and EAV antibodies was performed in all pregnant mares. Results No obvious gross lesions were observed in the foetuses. Nine Gram-negative isolates were obtained from all nine tissue samples and were identified as Salmonella spp. All of the isolates belonged to the B group, the O antigen epitope was 4, 12 and H antigen was not obtained. The isolates of Salmonella were characterised as sequence type (ST) 251. Detection of EHV-1, EHV-4 and EAV was negative. Main limitations The mechanism that causes abortion in donkeys needs further study and the lack of histological examination. Conclusion Salmonella abortus equi was isolated as the single agent and was responsible for the abortions. Equine practitioners should be aware of S. abortus equi infection as a cause of abortion in donkeys.

AB  - Summary.? Infection frequently elicits a coagulation response. Endotoxin triggers the formation of tissue factor initiating coagulation, down regulates anticoagulant mechanisms including the protein C pathway and heparin-like proteoglycans and up regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor. The overall physiological result of this is to promote coagulation through enhancing initiation, suppressing negative regulation and impairing fibrin removal. The response to infection also leads to tissue destruction. Nucleosomes and histones released from the injured cells trigger further inflammation, protection from the pathogen but further tissue injury leading to multi-organ failure. Such a complex response to infection presumably arises due to the role of coagulation in the control and clearance of the infectious agent.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

AB  - Summary Koebner?s phenomenon (KP) has been observed in a number of skin diseases, including vitiligo. Its clinical significance in vitiligo with respect to disease activity and course is still debatable, while its relevance for surgical techniques has been demonstrated in some reports. We present a literature review on the currently known facts about KP in vitiligo, including details of clinical, experimental, and histopathological changes. The consensus view is that there are still no methods to define and assess KP in vitiligo. A new classification is proposed to allow an evaluation of KP in daily practice or in experimental studies. However, many unanswered questions still remain after redefining KP in patients with vitiligo. Active research focusing on KP in vitiligo may not only provide unexpected clues in the pathogenesis of vitiligo but also help to tailor novel therapies against this chronic and often psychologically devastating skin disease.
