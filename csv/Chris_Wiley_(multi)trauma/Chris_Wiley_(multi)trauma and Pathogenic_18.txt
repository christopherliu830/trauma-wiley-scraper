AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care

AB  - Abstract The literature indicates that microorganisms have a critical role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. The advancement in microbiological study methods has allowed for the identification of newer species associated with the disease process. At our current understanding, however, the exact roles of specific microorganisms in apical periodontitis are not fully understood but the poly-microbial aetiology of the disease appears to be supported by the literature. The endodontic microbiota is comprised of a subset of microbiota present in the oral cavity, consisting of predominantly anaerobic bacterial species, some fungal and viral species. The pathogenesis of apical periodontitis is essentially the result of a complex interplay between bacterial and host factors, giving rise to a range of presentations depending on the balance of the interaction. The role of endodontic microbiota in the initiation and persistence of apical periodontitis means that the mainstay of endodontic treatment is the elimination of such bacteria. A challenge to the resolution of apical periodontitis after treatment lies in the inadequacy of treatment protocol in completely eradicating the pathogenic species and the inherent ability of certain species to survive the treatment. This issue should be the focus of future research as we continually search for more predictable treatment methods of achieving the resolution of apical periodontitis.

AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.

AB  - Prompt and accurate diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias can play a crucial role in ensuring appropriate counseling and management (both antenatal and postnatal). When a skeletal dysplasia is detected during the antenatal period, especially early in the pregnancy, it can be associated with a poor prognosis. It is important to make a diagnosis in antenatal presentation of skeletal dysplasias to inform diagnosis, predict prognosis, provide accurate recurrence risks, and options for prenatal genetic testing in future pregnancies. Prenatal ultrasound scanning is a useful tool to detect several skeletal dysplasias and sonographic measurements serve as reliable indicators of lethality. The lethality depends on various factors including gestational age at which features are identified, size of the chest and progression of malformations. Although, it is important to type the skeletal presentation as accurately as possible, this is not always possible in an antenatal presentation and it is important to acknowledge this uncertainty. In the case of a live birth, it is always important to reassess the infant. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by fragile bones. Here, we report an infant with severe OI born following a twin pregnancy in whom the bone disease is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.4160C >T, p.(Ala1387Val) located in the C-propeptide region of COL1A1. An assumption of lethality antenatally complicated his management in early life. We discuss this patient with particular emphasis on the neonatal presentation of a severe skeletal dysplasia and the lessons that may be learned in such situations. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect following surgical management is a severe complication for orthopaedic surgeons. Traditionally, the treatment protocol for the notorious complication involved thorough debridement, bone grafting, long-term antibiotic use and flap surgery. Alternatively, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a high concentration of platelets collected via centrifugation, has been successfully used as an adjuvant treatment for bone and soft-tissue infection in medical practices. PRP has numerous significant advantages, including stypsis, inflammation remission and reducing the amount of infected fluid. It increases bone and soft-tissue healing and allows fewer opportunities for transplant rejection. Through many years of studies showing the advantages of PRP, it has become preferred organic product for the clinical treatment of infections, especially for chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect. To promote the clinical use of this simple and efficacious technique in trauma, we report the case of a patient with chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect that healed uneventfully with PRP.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Contamination and infection of synovial cavities are a common occurrence in clinical practice and, if inadequately treated, may have career or life threatening consequences for affected horses. Hypothesis: The objectives in treating contamination and infection of joints, tendon sheaths and bursae are most effectively met by endoscopic surgery. Methods: Over a 6 year period, cases of synovial contamination and infection admitted to a referral clinic were evaluated and treated endoscopically. The horses received local and systemic antimicrobial drugs with minimal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication but no other medical or surgical treatment. All arthroscope and instrument portals and, when ever possible, all traumatic wounds were closed. Diagnostic information, endoscopic observations and results of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 140 affected animals were referred and 121 cases were treated endoscopically. These involved 70 joints, 29 tendon sheaths, 10 bursae and in 12 cases a combination of synovial cavities. The most common aetiologies were open wounds (n = 54) and self-sealing punctures (n = 41). Foreign material was identified endoscopically in 41 but predicted prior to surgery in only 6 cases. Osteochondral lesions were evident at surgery in 51 and recognised before surgery in 25 cases; 32 horses had intrathecal tendon or ligament defects. Follow-up information was obtained for 118 animals; 106 (90%) survived and 96 (81%) returned to their preoperative level of performance. The presence of osteitis/osteomyelitis, other osteochondral lesions and marked deposits of pannus were associated with nonsurvival. For those animals which survived, non-Thoroughbred horses, a combination of synovial structure involvement and regional i.v. antimicrobial administration were associated with reduced post operative performance. Marked pannus, regional i.v. antimicrobial administration and duration of systemic antimicrobial administration were associated with a group combining nonsurviving animals and those with reduced post operative performance. Conclusions: Endoscopic surgery makes a valuable contribution to the management of synovial contamination and infection. Potential relevance: The information obtained from and therapeutic options offered by endoscopy justify its early use in cases of synovial contamination and infection.

AB  - Objectives Wound infection has been proposed as a key indicator of clinical outcome after colorectal surgery. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that were associated with wound infections in patients undergoing either emergency or elective colonic resections. Patients and methods We prospectively evaluated 251 patients admitted to Royal Perth Hospital over a 12-month period. All patients received prophylactic peri-operative antibiotics and were reviewed for 6?weeks post-operatively. Wound infection was defined as either the presence of pus or a serous discharge containing pathogenic bacteria. We evaluated the relationship between 40 independent variables and the incidence of wound infection. Results There were 124 males and 127 females, of median age 68?years (range 14?90?years). The overall incidence of wound infection was 12%. Multiple logistic regression identified the presence of shock (odds ratio (OR) 14.6, P=0.05), atelectasis (OR 3.9, P=0.02), and number of days on antibiotics before surgery (OR 1.2, P=0.02) as significant independent variables. Conclusion These results suggest that the factors which were most often associated with wound infection were those that are indicative of either extensive disease or poor general health. The presence of a stoma and colonic perforation were not strong independent associations with wound infection.

AB  - A major question in research on immune responses in the brain is how the timing and nature of these responses influence physiology, pathogenesis or recovery from pathogenic processes. Proper understanding of the immune regulation of the human brain requires a detailed description of the function and activities of the immune cells in the brain. Zebrafish larvae allow long-term, noninvasive imaging inside the brain at high-spatiotemporal resolution using fluorescent transgenic reporters labeling specific cell populations. Together with recent additional technical advances this allows an unprecedented versatility and scope of future studies. Modeling of human physiology and pathology in zebrafish has already yielded relevant insights into cellular dynamics and function that can be translated to the human clinical situation. For instance, in vivo studies in the zebrafish have provided new insight into immune cell dynamics in granuloma formation in tuberculosis and the mechanisms involving treatment resistance. In this review, we highlight recent findings and novel tools paving the way for basic neuroimmunology research in the zebrafish. GLIA 2015;63:719?735

AB  - The idea that disturbances occurring early in brain development contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, often referred to as the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, has become widely accepted. Despite this, the disorder is viewed as being distinct nosologically, and by implication pathophysiologically and clinically, from syndromes such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability, which typically present in childhood and are grouped together as ?neurodevelopmental disorders?. An alternative view is that neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, rather than being etiologically discrete entities, are better conceptualized as lying on an etiological and neurodevelopmental continuum, with the major clinical syndromes reflecting the severity, timing and predominant pattern of abnormal brain development and resulting functional abnormalities. It has also been suggested that, within the neurodevelopmental continuum, severe mental illnesses occupy a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment as follows: intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent genomic studies have identified large numbers of specific risk DNA changes and offer a direct and robust test of the predictions of the neurodevelopmental continuum model and gradient hypothesis. These findings are reviewed in detail. They not only support the view that schizophrenia is a disorder whose origins lie in disturbances of brain development, but also that it shares genetic risk and pathogenic mechanisms with the early onset neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and ADHD). They also support the idea that these disorders lie on a gradient of severity, implying that they differ to some extent quantitatively as well as qualitatively. These findings have important implications for nosology, clinical practice and research.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans causing superficial mucosal infections and life-threatening systemic disease. The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact between the invading pathogen and the host innate immune system. As a result, the polysaccharides that comprise the cell wall act as pathogen associated molecular patterns, which govern the host?pathogen interaction. The cell wall is dynamic and responsive to changes in the external environment. Therefore, the host environment plays a critical role in regulating the host?pathogen interaction through modulation of the fungal cell wall. This review focuses on how environmental adaptation modulates the cell wall structure and composition, and the subsequent impact this has on the innate immune recognition of C.?albicans.

AB  - Summary Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is a progressive and painful disease syndrome that affects aged horses. It affects incisor, canine and infrequently cheek teeth, and is characterised by gingival inflammation, oedema and recession, calculus deposition, feed accumulation, subgingival swellings with or without associated draining tracts, bulbous enlargement of teeth, tooth mobility, associated periodontal disease, tooth fracture and/or tooth loss. The aetiology of EOTRH is likely to be multi-factorial. However, histopathological findings consistently suggest an aetiological contribution of initial biomechanical stresses and strains, followed by secondary involvement of micro-organisms. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, age and radiographic changes including lytic changes, widening or loss of the periodontal ligament, hypercementosis, tooth fracture and alveolar bone loss. Treatment of EOTRH is not currently possible, but the condition can be managed to some degree, quite successfully for many years in some cases. However, the disease is progressive and invariably results in extraction of the tooth or teeth involved. The prognosis is most probably guarded at best and poor in most cases; however, complete removal of affected teeth carries a good prognosis for an improved quality of life in the short to medium term.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a widely used clinical anesthetic with proven anti-inflammatory effects. Both high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammatory response to infection and trauma. Thus far, there have been no studies published addressing the effect of DEX on HMGB1 and pyroptosis. In order to fill this gap in the literature, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were exposed to HMGB1 (4?Âµg/mL) with or without DEX (50??M) pretreatment. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin 1? (IL-1?), and IL-18], phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and P38, and the activation of caspase-1 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, confocal microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DEX protected against HMGB1-induced cell death of BMDMs. In addition, DEX suppressed the generation of TNF-Î±, IL-1?, and IL-18 as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Moreover, DEX inhibited caspase-1 activation and decreasedÂ pyroptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the protective effect of DEX in mediating HMGB1-induced cellular injury, thus indicating that DEX may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of infection and trauma-derived inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Aims Biliary tract obstruction is a common clinical lesion. However, the effect of biliary tract obstruction on intestinal secretion is poorly understood. In this study, we made an investigation on intestinal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in an experimental model of murine biliary duct ligation. Methods Murine intestinal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions were examined in vitro in Ussing chambers by pH-stat and short-circuit current (Isc) techniques. The mRNA and protein expressions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the Na+?K+?2Cl? cotransporter (NKCC1) were analysed by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results Basal Cl? secretion and forskolin-stimulated duodenal and jejunal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in mice with common biliary duct ligation were markedly elevated, compared with controls (PÂ <Â 0.05 and PÂ <Â 0.01). Further experiments showed that basal Cl? secretion and forskolin-stimulated duodenal and jejunal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in mice with external bile drainage were also markedly elevated. CFTRinh-172 inhibited forskolin-stimulated HCO3? and Cl? secretions. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CFTR and NKCC1 in the intestinal mucosa with both biliary duct ligation and external bile drainage were markedly higher than those in controls (PÂ <Â 0.001). Bile acid administration restored the changes in function and expression of CFTR and NKCC1 in the intestinal mucosa. Conclusion Bile deficiency in the intestine up-regulates the expressions of intestinal mucosal CFTR and NKCC1 and enhances intestinal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretion capacity, which contributes to the understanding of intestinal physiological function for patients with biliary duct obstruction.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratioÂ =Â 2.692, PÂ =Â .023, nÂ =Â 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, PÂ =Â .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Background: Although hyperamylasemia has been reported in a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), its clinical significance as well as the pathogenic mechanism remain poorly understood. Apart from pancreatic cellular injury, impaired renal function or hypercalcemia after CPB was also proposed to play a possible role in the etiology of postoperative hyperamylasemia. The study was designed to investigate whether avoidance of CPB would limit amylase elevation. Methods: Serum levels of amylase and lipase were measured before operation, 24 and 48 hours after surgery in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without the use of CPB over a 10-month period. The choice of procedure was based mainly on the native coronary anatomy and left ventricular function. Postoperative complications as well as the plasma levels of creatinine and calcium were also carefully monitored. Results: Three surgical approaches were used for CABG: CPB (conventional on-pump through median sternotomy, n = 32), OPCAB (off-pump through median sternotomy, n = 14), and MIDCAB (off-pump through left minithoracotomy, n = 12). There was no hospital mortality. No patient had postoperative abdominal complications. Transient hyperamylasemia occurred in 14 patients, 7 in the CPB group (22%), 5 in the OPCAB group (36%), and 2 in the MIDCAB group (17%). The increase in amylase levels was similar among groups. However, no lipase elevation was detected in any patient. There was no clear correlation between hyperamylasemia and an increased creatinine level. Perioperative plasma calcium levels were normal in patients who had hyperamylasemia. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the incidence of hyperamylasemia among patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with or without the use of CPB and irrespective of mode of surgical access. Hence, CPB is not the major factor responsible for hyperamylasemia, as previously believed.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of desmosomal diseases have provided a clear demonstration of the key role played by desmosomes in tissue and organ physiology, highlighting the importance of their dynamic and finely regulated structure. In this context, non-desmosomal regulatory molecules have acquired increasing relevance in the study of this organelle resulting in extending the desmosomal interactome, named the ?desmo-adhesome.? Spatiotemporal changes in the expression and regulation of the desmo-adhesome underlie a number of genetic, infectious, autoimmune, and malignant conditions. The aim of the present article was to examine the structural and functional relationship of the desmosome, by providing a comprehensive, yet focused overview of the constituents targeted in human disease. The inclusion of the novel regulatory network in the desmo-adhesome pathophysiology opens new avenues to a deeper understanding of desmosomal diseases, potentially unveiling pathogenic mechanisms waiting to be explored.
