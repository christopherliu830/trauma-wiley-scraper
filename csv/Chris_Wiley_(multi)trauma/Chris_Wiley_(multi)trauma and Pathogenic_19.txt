AB  - Advances in our understanding of desmosomal diseases have provided a clear demonstration of the key role played by desmosomes in tissue and organ physiology, highlighting the importance of their dynamic and finely regulated structure. In this context, non-desmosomal regulatory molecules have acquired increasing relevance in the study of this organelle resulting in extending the desmosomal interactome, named the ?desmo-adhesome.? Spatiotemporal changes in the expression and regulation of the desmo-adhesome underlie a number of genetic, infectious, autoimmune, and malignant conditions. The aim of the present article was to examine the structural and functional relationship of the desmosome, by providing a comprehensive, yet focused overview of the constituents targeted in human disease. The inclusion of the novel regulatory network in the desmo-adhesome pathophysiology opens new avenues to a deeper understanding of desmosomal diseases, potentially unveiling pathogenic mechanisms waiting to be explored.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Abstract A 3500-year-old papyrus from ancient Egypt provides a list of treatments for many diseases including ?bite hair loss,? most likely alopecia areata (AA). The treatment of AA remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. In 30 CE, Celsus described AA presenting as scalp alopecia in spots or the ?windings of a snake? and suggested treatment with caustic compounds and scarification. The first ?modern? description of AA came in 1813, though treatment still largely employed caustic agents. From the mid-19th century onwards, various hypotheses of AA development were put forward including infectious microbes (1843), nerve defects (1858), physical trauma and psychological stress (1881), focal inflammation (1891), diseased teeth (1902), toxins (1912) and endocrine disorders (1913). The 1950s brought new treatment developments with the first use of corticosteroid compounds (1952), and the first suggestion that AA was an autoimmune disease (1958). Research progressively shifted towards identifying hair follicle-specific autoantibodies (1995). The potential role of lymphocytes in AA was made implicit with immunohistological studies (1980s). However, studies confirming their functional role were not published until the development of rodent models (1990s). Genetic studies, particularly genome-wide association studies, have now come to the forefront and open up a new era of AA investigation (2000s). Today, AA research is actively focused on genetics, the microbiome, dietary modulators, the role of atopy, immune cell types in AA pathogenesis, primary antigenic targets, mechanisms by which immune cells influence hair growth, and of course the development of new treatments based on these discoveries.

AB  - Translational research (TR) has many different potential definitions. There are two broad elements: one is research that serves as a bridge between basic science and the development/use of a therapeutic product/intervention; the second (also known as knowledge translation) explores why a clinically established product is not used more widely and/or further characterizes its optimal use. The first TR element has always been an integral part of transfusion medicine; it has previously been referred to as applied research or development. TR includes animal model research, and Phase I, II, and I/II clinical trials using human volunteers to determine safety and start evaluating efficacy of a novel therapy; some TR definitions also include definitive Phase III randomized controlled trials. TR usually needs a different infrastructure than basic research; funding may require public (government or university) and private (commercial companies) partnerships. Conducting TR requires a strong understanding of regulatory requirements and often necessitates the establishment of national or international multi-center research programs supported by sophisticated information technology and a clinical coordinating center well versed in these disciplines. To this end, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in the U.S. not only offers its usual funding mechanisms but has also developed several other funding mechanisms to better support and coordinate such activities. There are multiple examples of successful TR in transfusion medicine; these include nucleic acid testing for infectious disease agents, the use of monoclonal antibodies in immunohematology, and the transfusion of pathogen inactivated platelet and plasma products in many countries. Scientific questions addressed by animal model research include red cell alloimmunization, graft versus host disease, transfusion related immunomodulation, and transfusion related acute lung injury. A new area of transfusion medicine TR is the production of functional mature RBCs from cultures of embryonic stem cells. The issue of how to best conduct TR still remains; challenges include finding mechanisms to adequately fund technological and product development, overcoming regulatory obstacles to the licensing of new technologies, and designing and funding large clinical trials to answer many of the remaining questions about transfusion triggers and best transfusion practices. The knowledge translation component of TR offers additional challenges; these require a different set of investigator skills and infrastructure in order to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that can change clinical practice.

AB  - Case Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) caused by Clostridium butyricum is common in neonates; however, a case of NEC in adults has not been previously reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man developed C. butyricum-related NEC during hospitalization for treatment of stab wounds to the left side of the neck and lower abdomen, without organ damage, and concomitant pneumonia. Outcome The patient developed acute onset of emesis accompanied by shock during his admission; partial resection of the small intestine was carried out due to necrosis. Pathologic findings showed mucosal necrosis and extensive vacuolation with gram-positive rods in the necrotic small intestine. Blood culture tests revealed C. butyricum infection. The patient's condition improved after the surgery. He was moved to a rehabilitation hospital on day 66. Conclusion This study suggests that hospitalized adult patients who receive antibiotic treatment are at risk for NEC.

AB  - Summary 1.?Freshwater ecosystems, including ponds, lakes, streams and rivers, represent an interaction nexus between environmental change and a wide variety of infectious diseases, including human malaria, salmonid whirling disease, amphibian chytridiomycosis, crayfish plague and many others. However, few studies have explicitly examined patterns of disease in fresh waters and how they are changing over time. 2.?Freshwater environments can function as transmission foci for pathogens because of (i) the importance of fresh water for organism survival, (ii) the aquatic life histories of many vectors and intermediate hosts, (iii) the concentrated aggregations of species ? both freshwater and terrestrial ? in and around freshwater habitats and (iv) the highly altered condition of freshwater ecosystems, which can affect species interactions and disease pathology. 3.?To determine whether water-related diseases in wildlife are increasing, we used generalised additive models to quantitatively assess trends in the scientific literature (1970?2009) for major freshwater groups, including amphibians, molluscs, crayfishes, fishes, mammals, reptiles and birds. We further examined what types of pathogens were primarily responsible for observed patterns and whether recurrent groups or transmission modes could be identified. 4.?After correcting for research effort and temporal autocorrelation, we find that reports of disease varied over time and across freshwater taxa, with significant increases in amphibians, fishes and crayfishes, a significant decrease in molluscs, and no significant change in freshwater reptiles, birds or mammals. The types and diversity of pathogens varied considerably among groups. Reports of infection in amphibians were dominated by helminths and a chytridiomycete, in crayfishes by viruses and fungi, in molluscs by digenetic trematodes, in birds, fishes and mammals by viruses, protists and helminths and in reptiles by helminths and bacteria. 5.?These results provide some of the first quantitative evidence indicative of a long-term increase in disease-related research for freshwater taxa. Managing freshwater ecosystems to reduce or minimise human and wildlife disease risk ? arguably one of the most significant ecosystem services ? will require enhanced incorporation of ecological approaches alongside medical and veterinary tools.

AB  - Abstract:? Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal disorder characterized by dystrophin absence, courses with chronic inflammation, sarcolemmal damage, and skeletal muscle degeneration. Among the multiple pathogenic mechanisms proposed for DMD, oxidative stress and inflammation are directly involved in the dystrophic process. Unfortunately, there is no current treatment for DMD, and the inflammatory process is an important target for therapies. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin, we investigated whether melatonin treatment may reduce the dystrophic process. Ten DMD patients aged 12.8?±?0.98?yr, were treated with melatonin (60?mg at 21:00?hr plus 10?mg at 09:00?hr), and plasma levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrites (NOx), interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-?, and plasma markers of muscle injury, were determined at 3, 6 and 9?months of treatment. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were used as controls. The results show a significant increase in LPO, NOx, and cytokine levels in plasma of DMD patients compared with controls. Melatonin administration reduced these values to control levels at 3?months of treatment, decreasing further 9?months later. In parallel, melatonin also reduced plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK; 50%), lactate dehydrogenase (28%), aspartate aminotransferase (28%), alanine aminotransferase (20%), and myoglobin (13%). These findings strongly support the conclusion that melatonin administration significantly reduced the hyperoxidative and inflammatory process in DMD patients, reducing the muscle degenerative process.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact-finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi-component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non-core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that ?herd immunity? is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non-governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.

AB  - Abstract Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) affect around 2 million people admitted to acute care hospitals in the USA.1 Approximately 9 per cent of patients in UK hospitals suffer from an infection acquired during their hospital stay,2 many of which are due to multi-resistant, Gram-positive and Gram-negative patho-gens. The incidence of colonisation and infection with these pathogens continues to rise due to failures in hospital hygiene, selective pressures created by overuse of antibiotics, and mobile elements that can enc-ode bacterial resistance mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Accumulated evidences indicate intestinal lesions play an important role in the pathogenesis of heatstroke. However, the underlying mechanisms by which heat stress causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in heat stress-induced intestinal hyper-permeability and bacterial translocation. Intestinal permeability in heat stressed mouse was evaluated by determining plasma endotoxin concentration and urinal lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio with gastric administration of L/M solution. Venous blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tissues were collected for bacterial load test. Real time PCR was used to determine ileum PAR1 mRNA expression. In vitro study, permeability was assessed by determining trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human intestinal Caco-2 cell line. RWJ-58259, a selective antagonist of PAR1, was used both in vivo and in vitro studies. The results showed that heat stress could increase ileum PAR1 mRNA level, urinal L/M ratio, plasma endotoxin concentration and bacterial load in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Blocking PAR1 with RWJ-58259 (10?mg/kg) pretreatment could significantly reduce heat stress-induced above changes, but have no role to PAR1 mRNA level. In Caco-2 cells, heat stress-induced high permeability could also be reduced by RWJ-58259 (5?20?µmol/L). In summary, our results demonstrated that PAR1 signaling pathway may play an important role in the heat stress-induced elevation of intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation and the occurrence of endotoxemia.

The aim was to evaluate the disinfection properties of six multi-purpose contact lens disinfection solutions (MPDS) available in Iran against Fusarium solani and Candida albicans, based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14729 guidelines. Methods:? Three lots each of six multi-purpose solutions, namely, Renu MultiPlus, Solo Care Aqua, All-Clean soft, Contact All In One Advanced, Hippia, Ginza Multi-Purpose Solution and 0.9% normal saline solution were inoculated with standard strains of Fusarium solani (ATCC 36031) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Surviving fungi were determined by counting colony-forming units on recovery plates at specified times. The mean log reduction in fungal numbers at the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection time was determined and compared with the criteria for stand-alone disinfection products for each MPDS against each fungal strain. Results:? Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft were effective in achieving the mean 1.0 log reduction in fungal numbers, based on ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria. Solo Care Aqua failed to achieve the ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria for Candida albicans. The other solutions were not effective against test microorganisms after the specified times. Conclusions:? There were differences in the rates of disinfection efficacy. Generally, Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft exceeded the primary acceptance criteria of the ISO 14729 guidelines for stand-alone contact lens solutions.

AB  - Abstract American Indian (AI) communities have high levels of stress and trauma and are disproportionately affected by numerous preventable diseases. Here, we describe an academic?community partnership based on a collaboration between Blackfeet Community College students and faculty in Psychology and Immunology at Montana State University (MSU). The collaboration, which has spanned over 5 years, was sparked by community interest in the relationship between stress and disease on the Blackfeet reservation. Specifically, community members wanted to understand how the experience of psychological stress and trauma may affect disease risk in their community and identify factors that promote resilience. In doing so, they hoped to identify pathways through which health could be improved for individual community members. Here, we discuss all stages of the collaborative process, including development of measures and methods and themes of research projects, challenges for community members and non-indigenous collaborators, future directions for research, and the lessons learned. Finally, we note the ways in which this partnership and experience has advanced the science of community engagement in tribal communities, with the hope that our experiences will positively affect future collaborations between indigenous community members and non-indigenous scientists.

AB  - Tyloses form in xylem vessels in response to various environmental stimuli, but little is known of the kinetics or regulation of their development. Preliminary investigations indicated that wounds seal quickly with tyloses after pruning of grapevine shoots. In this study, tylose development was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively at different depths and times from pruning cuts along current-year shoots of grapevines at basal, middle, and apical stem regions. Tyloses developed simultaneously within a single vessel but much separated in time among vessels. Pruning caused prodigious tylosis in vessels of grape stems, extending to approximately 1 cm deep and to 7 d after wounding, but about half of the vessels did not become completely occluded. The fraction of vessels forming tyloses was greatest in basal (85%) and least in apical (50%) regions. The depth of maximum density of tyloses was 4 mm from the cut in the basal region and 2 mm from the cut in the middle and apical regions. Tylose development was faster in the basal and middle than in the apical region. The pattern of tylose development is discussed in the context of wound repair and pathogen movement in grapevines.

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Summary The two main causes of peptic ulceration are Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. H. pylori is now becoming less common in developed countries, so the relative contribution of NSAIDs, including low dose aspirin, is increasing. H. pylori - induced ulcers are caused by pathogenic strains of the bacterium infecting genetically susceptible hosts, and such ulcers are more common in smokers. NSAID ulcers are caused by NSAID inhibition of gastro-protective prostaglandins, and some NSAIDs are more ulcerogenic than others. The main symptom of peptic ulceration is epigastric pain, but NSAID ulcers in particular sometimes present atypically, and can be painless. Treatment of ulcers is with acid suppressing drugs, usually proton inhibitors, and treatment of the underlying cause to prevent recurrence. H. pylori can be diagnosed at endoscopy by urease test or by histology, or diagnosed non invasively by urea breath test, by stool antigen test or (less accurately) by serology. H. pylori should be treated in patients presenting with dyspepsia following non-invasive testing, and also when H. pylori-induced ulcers are found at endoscopy. Treatment is with two or more antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor given together for 1-2 weeks, the best regimen differing in different countries and different clinical contexts. Treatment of NSAID ulcers involves stopping the NSAIDs if possible and prescribing proton pump inhibitors. Prevention of NSAID ulcers is important: the least toxic NSAID available should be prescribed and in high risk patients and those with previous ulceration, co-prescription of a proton inhibitor greatly reduces ulcer risk. The most serious complications of peptic ulceration are bleeding and perforation. The former can be treated endoscopically and then with powerful acid suppressants; surgery is rarely required. The latter is treated by a simple surgical oversew and treatment or removal of the cause.
