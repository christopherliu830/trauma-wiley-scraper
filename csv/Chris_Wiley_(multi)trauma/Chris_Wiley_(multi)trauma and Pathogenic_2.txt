AB  - Objective? To present the technique for intra-articular catheter placement and report the clinical outcomes of 38 cases of equine synovial trauma and/or infection treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials administered via an intrasynovial catheter (ISC). Design? Retrospective study. Procedure? Medical records of 38 horses treated for synovial trauma and sepsis with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained via clinical re-evaluation or telephone contact with the owners. Results? The majority of horses (84%) received amikacin and Timentin? four times daily. In addition, synovial lavage through the ISC was carried out in 27 horses (71%). Only radiological evidence of osteolysis had a significant negative impact on both lameness at the time of hospital discharge and the long-term outcome. In total, 92% of horses treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had clinical resolution of infection. Catheter obstruction occurred in three cases, necessitating replacement or removal, and two synovial fistulae developed at sites of open drainage. The majority of horses treated had a favourable outcome, with 86% being at least pasture sound and 43% returned to riding. Conclusion? Septic synovial structures treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had a good prognosis for survival and 43% returned to riding, which is consistent with the results of other studies. The use of a simple ISC should be considered when broad-spectrum intrasynovial antimicrobial administration and lavage of a septic synovial structure are indicated.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal health states are difficult to quantify and no formal scale quantifying patients' utilities for periodontal health states exits. Multi-attribute utility (MAD) techniques were used to develop such a scale. The MAU scale maybe used to quantify patients' assessment of their current periodontal health and that of possible treatment outcomes. Such data, combined with probability values in formal decision analysis techniques would result in improved rationality of treatment planning for periodontal disease. 20 patients attending for routine undergraduate care were interviewed. Data from these interviews were sorted into groups of common interest (domains). Intra-domain health statements were complied from the interview content. 21 patients ranked the intra-domain statements on a scale of 0?100. This same group of patients also performed an inter-domain weighting. Mean results showed that patients were 2? as concerned with how they felt and with the prognosis of possible outcomes, than with how they looked and what facts they knew about their oral health. However, the real value of utilities research lies in application of individual results to treatment planning, as there is a wide range of opinion regarding outcome health states.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study The microbiota plays a key role in health and disease. Probiotics are a potential way to therapeutically modify the intestinal microbiota and prevent disease. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotics on the bacterial microbiota of foals during and after administration. Study design Randomised placebo controlled field trial. Methods Thirty-eight healthy neonatal foals enrolled in a previous study were selected. The foals had received a multi-strain probiotic (four Lactobacillus spp. 3?4 ? 103 colony-forming units (cfu)/g each, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis, 1 ? 103?4 cfu/g) or placebo once daily for 3 weeks. A total of 3 faecal samples were collected from each foal at 2-week intervals and assessed via metagenomic sequencing. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare data between treatment groups. Results There were no changes on the phylum, order or class level between treatment groups at any age (all P>0.05) but some significant changes in relative abundance of families. Probiotic administration did not result in an increased relative abundance of lactobacilli or bifidobacteria at any age (Lactobacillus: P = 0.9, P = 0.1 and P = 0.2, Bifidobacterium: P = 0.3, P = 0.6 and P = 0.1 for Weeks 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Lactobacillus was enriched in the probiotic group at Week 6 on LEfSe analysis (linear discriminant analysis score 0.34, P = 0 .02). There was no effect on alpha diversity (all P>0.2) or community structure when parsimony and unifrac analysis were applied (all P>0.6). Conclusions There were limited effects of probiotic treatment on the bacterial microbiota of foals. The studied probiotic based on lactobacilli and bifidobacteria has a limited potential for therapeutic modification of the gastrointestinal microbiota.

AB  - The association of bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans among others with periodontal disease offers the opportunity for the development of diagnostic tests that are based upon the detection and/or quantification of one or more of these organisms or their by-products in the plaque. Three of the putative periodontal pathogens namely, T. denticola, B. gingivalis, and B. forsythus, can hydrolyze the synthetic trypsin substrate, N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA) forming a color reaction. The present investigation evaluated a commercially developed solid state assay for BANA hydrolysis that can be read after 15 minutes incubation at chairside. A total of 702 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 117 patients seen at four university dental clinics and placed on reagent cards. The color development on the cards was compared to the presence of T. denticola and B. gingivalis in the plaque, and with the clinical appearance of the sampled sites. This multi-center study demonstrated that antibodies to B. gingivalis and T. denticola could detect these organisms by an ELISA in the majority of the subgingival plaque samples. Comparable information could be obtained when the same plaques were evaluated by the reagent card format for BANA hydrolysis. The ELISA and reagent card were comparable in their ability to distinguish between clinically healthy and diseased sites. Both diagnostic procedures detected the periodontopathogens in plaques from sites that were judged clinically healthy. The reagent card test has certain clinical advantages over the ELISA in that it is simple, can be performed quickly at chairside, and provides valuable information as to the pathogenicity of the microflora at discrete oral sites. Such information may be used in the detection of patients or intraoral sites at risk for periodontal disease. J Periodontol 1990;61:189-196.

AB  - Abstract Objective Blood pressure (BP) cuffs are potential vectors for transmission of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). The present study aims to determine MRO colonisation rates in BP cuffs from areas of high patient flow as an assessment of the quality of disinfection and infection control practices. Methods BP cuffs in the ED, high dependency unit (HDU) and operating theatres (OT) were prospectively examined after routine disinfection procedures. Swabs collected from the inner and outer surfaces of BP cuffs during inter-patient intervals were plated onto replicate organism detection and counting, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) chromogenic agar plates to detect rates of bacterial, MRSA and VRE colonisation, respectively. Results High bacterial colonisation rates were detected in BP cuffs from all three areas. BP cuffs from OT were significantly less colonised compared with cuffs from HDU and ED; 76% versus 96% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for inner surfaces and 86% versus 98% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for outer surfaces, respectively. Equivalent or higher bacterial growth was observed on the inner surface compared with outer surface in 54%, 84% and 86% of BP cuffs from OT, HDU and ED, respectively. MRSA was detected in 3 of 150 (2%) swabs collected, but no VRE was detected. Conclusion Although MRSA and VRE were infrequently isolated, current disinfection and infection control protocols need to be improved given the greater recovery of organisms from the inner compared with outer surfaces of BP cuffs.

AB  - This multi-center study evaluated guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in Class II furcation defects using a polylactic acid biodegradable barrier in 29 patients with mandibular and maxillary molar defects. Following an initial hygienic phase, surgical flaps were elevated, and the sites scaled and root planed. Furcation defect perimeter was measured and a customized barrier (thickness 600 to 750 ?) was applied to cover the defect. Barriers adhered directly to tooth and bone. At baseline, sites were measured for probing depth (PD) (6.0 ± 0.2 [SE] mm), gingival margin location (GML) (?0.2 ± 0.2 mm), and attachment level in both vertical (AL-V) (6.2 ± 0.2 mm) and horizontal (AL-H) (5.4 ± 0.2 mm) directions. After the surgical procedure, there was good compatibility between the gingival tissues and barrier material. Clinically, barriers fragmented and became displaced in 3 to 6 weeks. Substantial granulation tissue was sometimes present between barrier and root surfaces. Comprehensive periodontal examination parameters were measured 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes from baseline. At 6 and 12 months postsurgery, GML was close to the presurgical level (?0.5 ± 0.2 mm). There was clinically and statistically significant improvement in all other parameters: mean PD reduction (2.2 mm), AL-V gain (1.7 mm), and AL-H gain (2.5 mm). These results indicated favorable clinical regenerative outcomes after using this barrier material in Class II furcation defects in humans. J Periodontol 1995; 66:377?385.

AB  - Abstract Background Purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease characterized by pus accumulation in the pericardial space. Its incidence has declined substantially and the common pathogen has changed since the beginning of the antibiotic era; however, it is still found in some patients with immunocompromised conditions. Case report We report a rare case in which the onset of diabetes mellitus presented as extremely high HbA1c concentration, ketoacidosis, multi-site abscesses and purulent pericarditis. After antibiotic therapy and pericardiocentesis, the purulent pericarditis still did not resolve and further intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy also failed. Finally, this patient was treated successfully by surgical debridement and pericardiectomy. Conclusion In the immunocompromised state of severe hyperglycaemia, purulent pericarditis is a possible complication of uncontrolled infection. If purulent pericarditis cannot be cured using non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis and intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy, a surgical pericardiectomy should be considered to avoid morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Conventional storage of platelet concentrates limits their shelf life to between 5 and 7 days due to the risk of bacterial proliferation and the development of the platelet storage lesion. Cold storage and cryopreservation of platelets may facilitate extension of the shelf life to weeks and years, and may also provide the benefit of being more haemostatically effective than conventionally stored platelets. Further, treatment of platelet concentrates with pathogen inactivation systems reduces bacterial contamination and provides a safeguard against the risk of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. While each of these alternative storage techniques is gaining traction individually, little work has been done to examine the effect of combining treatments in an effort to further improve product safety and minimize wastage. This review aims to discuss the benefits of alternative storage techniques and how they may be combined to alleviate the problems associated with conventional platelet storage.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of apoptosis of monocytes in an experimental model of multiple trauma and its probable correlation to bacterial translocation. Thirty-two rabbits were applied in three groups: A, controls; B, myotomy of the right femur; and C, myotomy and fracture of the right femur. Blood was sampled for the estimation of endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, derived after centrifugation over Ficoll, were incubated in flasks and apoptosis of non-adherent lymphocytes and adherent monocytes was estimated after staining for Annexin-V and flow cytometry. TNF-α of supernatants of cultured monocytes was also determined. Tissue segments were cultured after death. Median survival of groups A, B and C was?>?14,?>?14 and 9·00?days, respectively. Apoptosis of lymphocytes in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48 h and of monocytes in group C higher than group A at 2 and 4 hours. LPS in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48?h. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and monocytes was correlated positively with serum TNF-α and negatively with TNF-α of monocyte supernatants. Cultures of organ segments of group A were sterile. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from liver, lung and spleen in five animals in group B (45·45%) and in six in group C (54·54%). Early apoptosis of blood monocytes supervened after multiple trauma; the phenomenon was accompanied by apoptosis of blood lymphocytes and subsequent bacterial translocation.

AB  - Summary This study is an initial description and discussion of the kidney and liver microbial communities of five common fish species sampled from four sites along the Eastern Mediterranean Sea shoreline. The goals of the present study were to establish a baseline dataset of microbial communities associated with the tissues of wild marine fish, in order to examine species-specific microbial characteristics and to screen for candidate pathogens. This issue is especially relevant due to the development of mariculture farms and the possible transmission of pathogens from wild to farmed fish and vice versa. Although fish were apparently healthy, 16S rRNA NGS screening identified three potential fish bacterial pathogens: Photobacterium damselae, Vibrio harveyi and Streptococcus iniae. Based on the distribution patterns and relative abundance, 16 samples were classified as potential pathogenic bacteria-infected samples (PPBIS). Hence, PPBIS prevalence was significantly higher in kidneys than in liver samples and variation was found between the fish species. Significant differences were observed between fish species, organs and sites, indicating the importance of the environmental conditions on the fish microbiome. We applied a consistent sampling and analytical method for monitoring in long-term surveys which may be incorporated within other marine fish pathogens surveys around the world.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.
