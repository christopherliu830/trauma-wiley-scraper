AB  - Summary A single determinant factor for autoimmunity does not exist; disease development probably involves contributions from genetics, the environment and immune dysfunction. Type 1 diabetes is no exception. Genomewide-associated studies (GWAS) analysis in T1D has proved disappointing in revealing contributors to disease prediction; the only reliable marker has been human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Specific HLAs include DR3/DR4/DQ2/DQ8, for example. Because HLA molecules present antigen to T cells, it is reasonable that certain HLA molecules have a higher affinity to present self-antigen. Recent studies have shown that additional polymorphisms in HLA that are restricted to autoimmune conditions are further contributory. A caveat is that not all individuals with the appropriate ?pro-autoimmune? HLA develop an autoimmune disease. Another crucial component is autoaggressive T cells. Finding a biomarker to discriminate autoaggressive T cells has been elusive. However, a subset of CD4 helper cells that express the CD40 receptor have been described as becoming pathogenic. An interesting function of CD40 on T cells is to induce the recombination-activating gene (RAG)1/RAG2 T cell receptor recombination machinery. This observation is contrary to immunology paradigms that changes in TCR molecules cannot take place outside the thymic microenvironment. Alteration in TCR, called TCR revision, not only occurs, but may help to account for the development of autoaggressive T cells. Another interesting facet is that type 1 diabetes (T1D) may be more than a single disease; that is, multiple cellular components contribute uniquely, but result ultimately in the same clinical outcome, T1D. This review considers the process of T cell maturation and how that could favor auto-aggressive T cell development in T1D. The potential contribution of TCR revision to autoimmunity is also considered.

AB  - Summary The two main causes of peptic ulceration are Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. H. pylori is now becoming less common in developed countries, so the relative contribution of NSAIDs, including low dose aspirin, is increasing. H. pylori - induced ulcers are caused by pathogenic strains of the bacterium infecting genetically susceptible hosts, and such ulcers are more common in smokers. NSAID ulcers are caused by NSAID inhibition of gastro-protective prostaglandins, and some NSAIDs are more ulcerogenic than others. The main symptom of peptic ulceration is epigastric pain, but NSAID ulcers in particular sometimes present atypically, and can be painless. Treatment of ulcers is with acid suppressing drugs, usually proton inhibitors, and treatment of the underlying cause to prevent recurrence. H. pylori can be diagnosed at endoscopy by urease test or by histology, or diagnosed non invasively by urea breath test, by stool antigen test or (less accurately) by serology. H. pylori should be treated in patients presenting with dyspepsia following non-invasive testing, and also when H. pylori-induced ulcers are found at endoscopy. Treatment is with two or more antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor given together for 1-2 weeks, the best regimen differing in different countries and different clinical contexts. Treatment of NSAID ulcers involves stopping the NSAIDs if possible and prescribing proton pump inhibitors. Prevention of NSAID ulcers is important: the least toxic NSAID available should be prescribed and in high risk patients and those with previous ulceration, co-prescription of a proton inhibitor greatly reduces ulcer risk. The most serious complications of peptic ulceration are bleeding and perforation. The former can be treated endoscopically and then with powerful acid suppressants; surgery is rarely required. The latter is treated by a simple surgical oversew and treatment or removal of the cause.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength due to excessive loss of bone protein and mineral content. The imbalance between osteogenesis by osteoblasts and osteoclastogenesis by osteoclasts contributes to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Estrogen withdrawal leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Overactivated osteoclasts by inflammation play a vital role in the imbalance. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus with various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Here we demonstrate that matrine significantly prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vivo with decreased serum levels of TRAcp5b, TNF-Î±, and IL-6. In vitro matrine significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator for NF-?B ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF in bone marrow monocytes and RAW264.7 cells as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and actin-ring formation as well as bone resorption through pit formation assays. For molecular mechanisms, matrine abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-?B, AKT, and MAPK pathways and suppressed osteoclastogenesis-related marker expression, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, NFATc1, TRAP, C-Src, and cathepsin K. Our study demonstrates that matrine inhibits osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways and that matrine is a promising agent in the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases such as osteoporosis.?Chen, X., Zhi, X., Pan, P., Cui, J., Cao, L., Weng, W., Zhou, Q., Wang, L., Zhai, X.

AB  - Abstract Developmental environments influence individuals' long-term health trajectories, and there is increasing emphasis on understanding the biological pathways through which this occurs. Epigenetic aging evaluates DNA methylation at a suite of distinct CpG sites in the genome, and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is linked to heightened chronic morbidity and mortality risks in adults. Consequently, EAA provides insights on trajectories of biological aging, which early life experiences may help shape. However, few studies have measured correlates of children's epigenetic aging, especially outside of the U.S. and Europe. In particular, little is known about how children's growth and development relate to EAA in ecologies in which energetic and pathogenic stressors are commonplace. We studied EAA from dried blood spots among Bondongo children (nÂ =Â 54) residing in a small-scale, fisher-farmer society in a remote region of the Republic of the Congo. Here, infectious disease burdens and their resultant energy demands are high. Children who were heavier for height or taller for age, respectively, exhibited greater EAA, including intrinsic EAA, which is considered to measure EAA internal to cells. Furthermore, we found that children in families with more conflict between parents had greater intrinsic EAA. These results suggest that in contexts in which limited energy must be allocated to competing demands, more investment in growth may coincide with greater EAA, which parallels findings in European children who do not face similar energetic constraints. Our findings also indicate that associations between adverse family environments and greater intrinsic EAA were nonetheless observable but only after adjustment for covariates relevant to the energetically and immunologically demanding nature of the local ecology.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Summary Background There is limited information about bacterial isolates that are present on the equine midline incision during and following exploratory laparotomy. Objectives To investigate the bacterial species cultured from the ventral midline pre-, intra- and post- laparotomy, whether particular bacterial isolates are associated with the development of surgical site infections (SSIs) and to report the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of these isolates. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods The ventral midline of 31 horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy was sampled for bacterial culture at set time-points pre, intra and post-operatively. Inclusion criteria were that horses must have undergone exploratory laparotomy within 90 min of the initial colic examination upon hospital admission and must not have been placed in a stable prior to surgery. SSI was defined as any purulent or serous discharge from the laparotomy incision of >24 h duration. Results Seven horses (22.6%) developed a SSI. None of the variables tested were associated with the altered risk of SSI. The prevalence of a positive bacterial culture from the incision increased progressively over time and a variety of bacteria were isolated. A positive intra-operative culture was not a predictor of SSI; and when a SSI did occur, it was due to a different bacterial isolate. MRSA and ESBL-producers were identified in the post-operative period in one and four different horses respectively, but none of these developed a SSI. Main limitations Sampling was limited to hospitalisation and no culture results were available for horses developing SSI following hospital discharge. Conclusions A variety of bacterial species may be isolated from equine laparotomy incisions peri-operatively without development of SSI. SSI does not appear to be solely related to bacterial contamination of the incision peri-operatively and other mechanisms such as bacteraemia merit further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes are involved in non-cell-autonomous pathogenic cascades in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, their role is still debated. We show that astrocytic NF-?B activation drives microglial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration in the SOD1 (G93A) ALS model. This response prolongs the presymptomatic phase, delaying muscle denervation and decreasing disease burden, but turns detrimental in the symptomatic phase, accelerating disease progression. The transition corresponds to a shift in the microglial phenotype showing two effects that can be dissociated by temporally controlling NF-?B activation. While NF-?B activation in astrocytes induced a Wnt-dependent microglial proliferation in the presymptomatic phase with neuroprotective effects on motoneurons, in later stage, astrocyte NF-?B-dependent microglial activation caused an accelerated disease progression. Notably, suppression of the early microglial response by CB2R agonists had acute detrimental effects. These data identify astrocytes as important regulators of microglia expansion and immune response. Therefore, stage-dependent microglia modulation may be an effective therapeutic strategy in ALS.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are successfully used as immunomodulatory therapy in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) but their mechanism of action remains unknown. An anti-idiotypic block of pathogenic autoantibodies has been often postulated even if other possible mechanisms, including a modulation of the release of various cytokines, have been proposed. To evaluate the expression of cytokines in patients with MMN and their possible modulation by IVIg, we determined circulating levels of TNFÎ±, INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12 by ELISA in serum samples of 17 patients with MMN and compared them with 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 with multiple sclerosis (MS), 6 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 5 with myasthenia gravis (MG) and 12 healthy controls (NS). Comparable levels of INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10 and IL12 were detected in patients? sera and controls. Even if TNFÎ± levels did not differ significantly among patients? groups, they were higher than in any healthy control (mean?Â±?SD 1.2?Â±?0.5?pg/ml, range 0.7?2.4?pg/ml), in 12 (70%) MMN patients (mean?Â±?SD 3.6?Â±?1.9?pg/ml; range 0.2?7.5?pg/ml), all ALS, 3 MS (25%), 2 CIDP (40%) and 2 MG (40%). We then measured the concentration of TNFÎ± before and after IVIg therapy in 9 MMN and 2 ALS patients. In all but one MMN patients, circulating levels of TNFÎ± slightly increased after treatment with IVIg (mean values 4.3 vs. 7.2?pg/ml) and decreased 3 weeks after therapy while in both ALS patients they decreased or remained unchanged. No detectable level of TNFÎ± was found in IVIg preparation. This study shows that, similarly to what previously reported in other autoimmune neuropathy as GBS and CIDP, TNFÎ± serum levels are slightly increased in MMN but, at odds with what reported in these disease, their concentration tend to increase parallel to clinical improvement after IVIg therapy. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenetic implication of this finding and in particular whether a possible deviation from a presumably Th2 to a Th1 immune response may help explaining the effect of IVIg in MMN.

AB  - Abstract Tendon injuries are common musculoskeletal system disorders in clinical, but the regeneration ability of tendon is limited. Tendon stem cells (TSCs) have shown promising effect on tissue engineering and been used for the treatment of tendon injury. Exosomes that serve as genetic information carriers have been implicated in many diseases and physiological processes, but effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury repair is unclear. The aim of this study is to make clear that the effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury healing. Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5Â weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3. Exosomes from TSCs could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing for its balancing tendon extracellular matrix and promoting the tenogenesis of TSCs.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Aims Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness, spasticity, paralysis and death usually within 2?5Â years of onset. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS pathology characterized by activation of glial cells, which respond by upregulating small heat shock proteins (HSPBs), but the exact underlying pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the association between ALS disease duration, lower motor neuron loss, TARDNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, neuroinflammation and HSPB expression. Methods With immunohistochemistry, we examined HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB6, HSPB8 and HSP16.2 expression in cervical, thoracic and sacral spinal cord regions in 12 ALS cases, seven with short disease duration (SDD), five with moderate disease duration (MDD), and ten age-matched controls. Expression was quantified using ImageJ to examine HSP expression, motor neuron numbers, microglial and astrocyte density and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43+) inclusions. Results SDD was associated with elevated HSPB5 and 8 expression in lateral tract astrocytes, while HSP16.2 expression was increased in astrocytes in MDD cases. SDD cases had higher numbers of motor neurons and microglial activation than MDD cases, but similar levels of motor neurons with pTDP-43+ inclusions. Conclusions Increased expression of several HSPBs in lateral column astrocytes suggests that astrocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. SDD is associated with increased microgliosis, HSPB5 and 8 expression in astrocytes, and only minor changes in motor neuron loss. This suggests that the interaction between motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes determines neuronal fate and functional decline in ALS.

AB  - Objective To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (?ear cleaners?) against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections. Methods Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test. Results Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. Clinical Significance Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of sampling methods on culture results and selection of antimicrobials for treating infected wounds in dogs. Design Prospective study from January to July 2016. Setting Three private multispecialty referral centers. Animals Fifty-two client-owned dogs with infected wounds. Interventions Each wound was sampled for culture by 3 methods: swabbing prior to preparation (dirty swabs), swabbing after debridement and sterile lavage (clean swabs), and biopsy. Bacterial species and phenotypes were compared. Three clinicians unaware of patient, wound, and sampling information selected antimicrobial drugs based on culture and sensitivity reports. Antimicrobials were divided into class I, II, or III based on established guidelines. The number, highest class of antimicrobial chosen, and inter-investigator agreement were examined. Measurements and Main Results Identical populations of bacteria were isolated for all 3 sampling techniques in only 31% of wounds. Significantly fewer bacterial species were isolated from biopsy samples (1.87 bacterial species per wound Â± 1.14) than from clean swab samples (2.29 Â± 1.18; P = 0.009) but not dirty swab samples (2.29 Â± 1.29; P = 0.06). The recovery frequency for gram-positive bacteria was lower for biopsy compared to either swabbing technique (P = 0.001 for both comparisons). No difference was observed between clean and dirty swabbing techniques for any parameter examined. Sampling technique did not affect the proportion of wounds with anaerobic, gram-negative, or multi-drug resistant bacteria. The number (P = 0.28) and highest class of antimicrobial (P = 0.9) selected per wound did not differ between the 3 sampling techniques (P = 0.28). Clinician agreement was 83?90% depending on sampling technique. Conclusion Although there were some differences in bacteria isolated from biopsy samples compared to swab samples from infected wounds, technique did not influence the number and highest class of antimicrobial selected by clinicians. Wound debridement prior to sampling by swabbing did not alter the number or type of bacteria isolated, nor the number or the highest class of antimicrobial selected by clinicians.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.
