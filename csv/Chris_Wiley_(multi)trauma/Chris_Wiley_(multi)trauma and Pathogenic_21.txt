AB  - The present review aimed to summarize the effectiveness and features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of infectious diseases and to discuss the limitation of the development of TCM. The personalized medicine with TCM exerts a curative effect on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with unique advantages on the improvement of clinical manifestation, pathogen inhibition, and organ recovery during severe and drug-resistant infection. The deficiency of personalized medicine with TCM lies in that the current research design of TCM primarily focuses on the study of the effective components and material basis of Chinese herbs at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level, while ignoring the guidance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, which is the core concept of individualized treatment. Personalized medicine with TCM has a broad prospective for infectious diseases due to the specific efficacy and advantages. While the curative effect of individualized treatment with TCM cannot be excluded from the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, the study of personalized medicine with TCM for infectious diseases urgently requires a unified standardization of the clinical syndrome differentiation and the evolution rule of infectious diseases by TCM theory.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Summary A 74-year-old woman presented with an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titre-negative, treatment-responsive Wegener's granulomatosis confined to the integument. She initially presented with a painful left postauricular nodulo-ulcerative lesion with chronically discharging sinuses. This lesion was effectively treated with a short, 3-month course of cyclophosphamide and 24 months of oral prednisone. After 5 months in remission, she developed further similar ulcers, in addition to painless nodules on her ankles and feet bilaterally. These lesions resolved with an extra 32 months of high-dose oral prednisone therapy before complete remission. At most recent review, there was no evidence of disease recurrence 21 months after ceasing all active treatment. Histology demonstrated a granulomatous inflammation. No systemic disease progression to the upper respiratory tract, lung or kidney was detected. This case highlights the importance of being aware of atypical or partial presentations of Wegener's granulomatosis. This diagnosis needs to be considered with patients presenting with a culture-negative chronic ulcer, where malignancy and trauma have been excluded. This will avoid unnecessary surgery and ensure early diagnosis and effective treatment of a disease that is disfiguring and usually fatal if inappropriately treated.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

Study Design Cross-sectional study. Sample Population Personnel including clinical faculty, house officers, technicians, and veterinary students working at the OVCHSC. Methods Electrostatic cloths were used to sample WC and SS of hospital personnel. Samples were tested for MRSA and MRSP and isolates were typed. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and data was evaluated for risk factors. Results Of 114 specimens, MRS were isolated from 20 (17.5%), MRSA from 4 (3.5%), and MRSP from 16 (14.0%). Technicians were 9.5? (OR?=?0.95, 95% CI: 1.2?∞, P?=?.03) more likely than students to have clothing contaminated with MRSA. No risk factors were identified for MRSP or for overall MRS contamination. Conclusions Standard hospital clothing was found to have a high prevalence of MRS contamination in a veterinary teaching hospital and could be a source of hospital-acquired infections.

AB  - Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration and leads to death within a few years of diagnosis. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of ALS is proposed to be a dysfunction in the protein quality-control machinery. Dorfin has been identified as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that recognizes and ubiquitinates mutant SOD1 proteins, thereby accelerating their degradation and reducing their cellular toxicity. We examined the effects of human Dorfin overexpression in G93A mutant SOD1 transgenic mice, a mouse model of familial ALS. In addition to causing a decrease in the amount of mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord, Dorfin overexpression ameliorated neurological phenotypes and motor neuron degeneration. Our results indicate that Dorfin overexpression or the activation or induction of E3 may be a therapeutic avenue for mutant SOD1-associated ALS. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Summary Stress known to stimulate sympathetic activity, as well as the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis (HPA), produces a significant increase in adrenomedullin (AdM) levels, suggesting a regulatory or protective role for AdM in countering HPA activation that follows a variety of stressors. Stressors can modulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a potent activator of the HPA and appears to play a pathogenic role in conditions related to stress. In the present study, we investigated the administration of AdM on IL-6 levels in cold exposed rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups as control, adrenomedullin treatment, cold stress and cold stress+adrenomedullin-treated groups. In the adrenomedullin-treated group, animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of adrenomedullin (2000?ng/kg body weight) once a day for a week. For the cold stress exposure the rats were kept in separate cages at 10°C for a week. Control group rats were kept in laboratory conditions. The concentration of IL-6 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. When compared to control, IL-6 levels increased significantly in the cold stress- and adrenomedullin-treated groups (P?<?0·05). Administration of AdM in addition to cold stress decreased IL-6 levels in lung and liver, but increased in brain and heart when compared to control (P?<?0·05). The results suggest that cold stress may induce increase of rat proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and adrenomedullin may play a regulatory or protective role for cold stress.

AB  - Abstract The Museum Vrolik collection of anatomical specimens in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, comprises over 5,000 specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, we rediagnosed a subset of the collection comprising dried infantile, juvenile, and adult human skulls with congenital and acquired conditions. On external examination and additional radiography, we found 58 skulls with craniosynostosis (CS) involving one or more sutures and 40 skulls with a presumed suture related condition. Most of these were part of the material collected and described by Louis Bolk (1866?1930). Analysis of his observations suggests that skull deformation because of premature suture closure depends not only on the identity of the sutures involved but also on the timing and progression of their closure and the extent of their involvement. Moreover, premature closure of the sagittal suture after 3?6 years of age appeared to be much more common than expected because it is not accompanied by skull deformation. Many of the skulls with single-suture CS were microcephalic, which may be the cause of the premature synostosis. By contrast, microcephaly may be a resulting phenomenon in multi-suture CS. We noticed that the quotient between height of the cranial vault (vertex-porion distance) and head circumference, multiplied by 100, was 26 or higher only in those CS cases with multi-suture involvement. We therefore consider this parameter, which we named ?acrocephalic index,? to be an indicator of multi-suture involvement in individual CS cases. In two adult skulls, the skull had a quadrangular shape, which we assumed to be correlated to the presence of an unusually interdigitated open metopic suture. We propose to name this anomaly: tetragonocephaly. Another presumed suture-related condition, bathrocephaly, was found concomitantly with basilar invagination in several cases. We hypothesize that the chronically raised intracranial pressure in these cases caused the still open lambdoidal sutures to distend and the occipital bone to protrude. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Acute infections caused by pathogenic bacteria have been studied extensively for well over 100 years. These infections killed millions of people in previous centuries, but they have been combated effectively by the development of modern vaccines, antibiotics and infection control measures. Most research into bacterial pathogenesis has focused on acute infections, but these diseases have now been supplemented by a new category of chronic infections caused by bacteria growing in slime-enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Biofilm infections, such as pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients, chronic wounds, chronic otitis media and implant- and catheter-associated infections, affect millions of people in the developed world each year and many deaths occur as a consequence. In general, bacteria have two life forms during growth and proliferation. In one form, the bacteria exist as single, independent cells (planktonic) whereas in the other form, bacteria are organized into sessile aggregates. The latter form is commonly referred to as the biofilm growth phenotype. Acute infections are assumed to involve planktonic bacteria, which are generally treatable with antibiotics, although successful treatment depends on accurate and fast diagnosis. However, in cases where the bacteria succeed in forming a biofilm within the human host, the infection often turns out to be untreatable and will develop into a chronic state. The important hallmarks of chronic biofilm-based infections are extreme resistance to antibiotics and many other conventional antimicrobial agents, and an extreme capacity for evading the host defences. In this thesis, I will assemble the current knowledge on biofilms with an emphasis on chronic infections, guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of these infections, before relating this to my previous research into the area of biofilms. I will present evidence to support a view that the biofilm lifestyle dominates chronic bacterial infections, where bacterial aggregation is the default mode, and that subsequent biofilm development progresses by adaptation to nutritional and environmental conditions. I will make a series of correlations to highlight the most important aspects of biofilms from my perspective, and to determine what can be deduced from the past decades of biofilm research. I will try to bridge in vitro and in vivo research and propose methods for studying biofilms based on this knowledge. I will compare how bacterial biofilms exist in stable ecological habitats and opportunistically in unstable ecological habitats, such as infections. Bacteria have a similar lifestyle (the biofilm) in both habitats, but the fight for survival and supremacy is different. On the basis of this comparison, I will hypothesize how chronic biofilm infections are initiated and how bacteria live together in these infections. Finally, I will discuss different aspects of biofilm infection diagnosis. Hopefully, this survey of current knowledge and my proposed guidelines will provide the basis and inspiration for more research, improved diagnostics, and treatments for well-known biofilm infections and any that may be identified in the future.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - Background and Objectives Biofilms cause more than 80% of infections in humans, including more than 90% of all chronic wound infections and are extremely resistant to antimicrobials and the immune system. The situation is exacerbated by the fast spreading of antimicrobial resistance, which has become one of the biggest threats to current public health. There is consequently a critical need for the development of alternative therapeutics. Antimicrobial blue light (aBL) is a light-based approach that exhibits intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the involvement of exogenous photosensitizers. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial effect of this non-antibiotic approach against biofilms formed by microbial isolates of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Study Design/Materials and Methods Microbial isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were studied. Biofilms were grown in microtiter plates for 24 or 48?hours or in the CDC biofilm reactor for 48?hours and exposed to aBL at 405?nm (60?mW/cm2, 60 or 30?minutes). The anti-biofilm activity of aBL was measured by viable counts. Results The biofilms of A. baumannii, N. gonorrhoeae, and P. aeruginosa were the most susceptible to aBL with between 4 and 8 log10 inactivation after 108?J/cm2 (60?mW/cm2, 30?minutes) or 216?J/cm2 (60?mW/cm2, 60?minutes) aBL were delivered in the microplates. On the contrary, the biofilms of C. albicans, E. coli, E. faecalis, and P. mirabilis were the least susceptible to aBL inactivation (?0.30, ?0.24, ?0.84, and ?0.68 log10 inactivation, respectively). The same aBL treatment in biofilms developed in the CDC biofilm reactor, caused ?1.68 log10 inactivation in A. baumannii and ?1.74 and ?1.65 log10 inactivation in two different strains of P. aeruginosa. Conclusions aBL exhibits potential against pathogenic microorganisms and could help with the significant need for new antimicrobials in clinical practice to manage multidrug-resistant infections.
