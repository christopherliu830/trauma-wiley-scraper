AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Although antimicrobial-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is the most frequently observed adverse effect of antimicrobial therapy in horses, few multicentred studies on the prevalence of AAD have been performed. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of AAD in horses that developed diarrhoea after antimicrobial treatment for nondiarrhoeic conditions and identify the antimicrobials used. Methods: The 2009 database of 3 referral hospitals was searched to identify nonhospitalised horses (weanling age or older) treated with antimicrobials for nongastrointestinal conditions. Horses with these criteria that presented with diarrhoea during 2009 were included in the study. Additional information, including antimicrobial administered and results of faecal pathogen testing, was gathered on each hospitalised case. Results: Of the 5251 horses treated with antimicrobials for nongastrointestinal signs, 32 were diagnosed with probable AAD, a prevalence of 0.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.43?0.86%). The AAD-diagnosed horses had an 18.8% (6/32) mortality rate. Horses with AAD had been treated for an average of 4.2 days. The most frequently used antimicrobials in horses with AAD were gentamicin in combination with penicillin (n = 7), enrofloxacin (n = 7) and doxycycline (n = 4). Clostridium difficile was identified in faecal samples from 4 horses, 2 of which died and Salmonella from 3 horses. Conclusions: Results indicated that the prevalence of AAD is low. Any antimicrobial class commonly used in equine practice is a potential cause of equine AAD. Other risk factors, such as opportunistic enteropathogens, may play a part in the development of diarrhoea secondary to antimicrobial usage. Potential relevance: Although the risk of equine AAD is low, this sequela of antimicrobial treatment is possible especially when opportunistic enteropathogens or other risk factors are present. Because drugs from any antimicrobial class can be potentially involved in AAD, clinicians have additional incentive to ensure the judicious use of antimicrobial agents.

However, recent evidence appears to contradict the traditional dogmatic approach that linked cough to congestive heart failure in dogs. Here we use a question-based format to introduce and discuss the modern evidence regarding ?cardiac cough? and the interpretation of this important but often misleading clinical sign.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study aimed to evaluate in a Belgian population the frequence of mucositis and peri-implantitis in patients with implants of at least 5 years of function. Another outcome was to access implants/patients characteristics as possible risk indicators for peri-implantitis. Material and methods One hundred and three patients (38 males/65 females) with a total of 266 implants were examined. Implants had been inserted in university hospitals as well as in private clinics and the mean time of implants in function was 8.5 years (±3.2). The average patients' age within the population was 62 years (±13.4). General health informations were recorded as well as habits regarding smoking, maintenance visits and oral hygiene. Full mouth clinical parameters (PlI, BoP, PPD) were assessed and radiographs taken to determine the periodontal status and implants diagnosis. Results Prevalences of mucositis and peri-implantitis at the patient's level were respectively 31% and 37%. They were 38% and 23% at the implant's level. Subjects older than 65 years (OR = 1.39) and those with active periodontitis (OR = 1.98) were prone to peri-implantitis. The association was stronger for hepatitis (OR = 2.92) and totally edentulous patients (OR = 5.56). Finally, at the implant's level, a significant correlation was found in the multi-level analyses between rough surfaces, overdentures and peri-implantitis. Conclusion After 8.5 years an important proportion (±60%) of implants presented biological complications. Furthermore, a positive correlation was showed between age, periodontitis, absence of teeth, rough surfaces and peri-implantitis. Consequently, patients with such characteristics should be informed before implant placement and frequently re-called after for maintenance visits.

AB  - Summary Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is an important component of the first-line defence against infections. Evidence has shown that MBL deficiency, reducing phagocytosis and internalization of intracellular pathogens may protect the host against intracellular infections such as leprosy. In this study, we speculated whether genetically determined low MBL serum levels confer protection against Mycobacterium leprae infection. One hundred and ninety-one patients with leprosy, presenting lepromatous (n?=?118), tuberculoid (n?=?31), dimorph (n?=?30) and indeterminate (n?=?12) clinical forms and 110 healthy controls matched with the patients according to sex, age and ethnic background were investigated. MBL concentrations were measured in a double-antibody enzyme immune assay and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels by nephelometry. A significant negative association of MBL low values (<?100?ng/ml) was observed with lepromatous patients when comparing with controls and tuberculoid patients [10/118, 8·47%versus 21/110, 19·09%P?=?0·03 ?2 with Yates? correction, odds ratio (OR) 0·39, confidence interval (CI) 0·18?0·88 and 8/31, 25·81%, P?=?0·02, OR 0·27, CI 0·09?0·75, respectively]. There was no significant difference in the distribution of MBL levels between patients and controls or among the clinical forms. The concentration of CRP was significantly increased in the patients (P?=?0·0002) and in the lepromatous form (P?=?0·0001) when compared to controls. A weak positive correlation between MBL and CRP levels was observed in the patients (P?=?0·010, R?=?0·255). These data suggest a protective role for MBL deficiency against the development of the most severe and multi-bacillary form of leprosy.

AB  - Summary Chemical immobilization of wild animals is a form of veterinary anesthesia conducted under difficult circumstances. The ideal capture site should allow good visualization of the animal during the induction period. Hyperthermia is a serious complication that can be difficult to treat in field situations. Equipment for airway support, including appropriately sized endotracheal tubes and a bag valve mask to enable mechanical ventilation should be included in an emergency kit. Physical capture, such as net gunning, rocket nets, drive nets, traps, and snares, can induce greater stress than chemical immobilization. Remote drug delivery systems have the potential to produce serious injury and death, if used inappropriately. The major sources of injury arise from dart impact trauma, high velocity injection of dart contents, and inaccurate dart placement. Careful planning, close monitoring, and early intervention are essential for preventing morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurological disorder. Mutations in five genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, and MYORG) have been linked to PFBC. Here, we used SYBR green-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in 20 unrelated patients with PFBC, negatively sequenced for the five known genes. We identified three deletions in SLC20A2, including a large de novo full gene deletion and two exonic deletions confined to exon 2 and exon 6, respectively. Subsequent linked-read whole-genome sequencing of the patient with the large deletion showed a 1.7 Mb heterozygous deletion which removed the entire coding regions of SLC20A2 as well as 21 other genes. In the family with a deletion of exon 6, a missense variant of uncertain significance (SLC20A2: p.E267Q) also co-segregated with the disease. Functional assay showed the deletion could result in significantly impaired phosphate transport, whereas the p.E267Q variant did not. Our results confirm that deletion in SLC20A2 is a causal mechanism for PFBC and highlight the importance of functional study for classifying a rare missense variant as (likely) pathogenic.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - We aimed to identify statistical predictor variables of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced physical sickness symptoms during the acute and late inflammatory phases using multivariate regression analyses. Data from N?=?128 healthy volunteers who received i.v. LPS injection (0.4 or 0.8?ng/kg) or placebo were pooled for analyses. Physical sickness symptoms experienced during the acute (0?6h postinjection) and late (6?24h postinjection) phases were assessed with the validated General-Assessment-of-Side-Effects (GASE) questionnaire. LPS-treated subjects reported significantly more physical sickness symptoms. Physical symptoms during the acute phase were associated with LPS-induced mood impairments and interleukin (IL)-6 increases, explaining 28.5% of variance in GASE scores. During late phase, LPS-induced increases in cortisol and IL-6 plasma concentrations and baseline depression were significant predictor variables, explaining 38.5% of variance. In patients with recurrent or chronic inflammatory states, these factors may act as risk factors ultimately contributing to an exacerbation of sickness symptoms, and should be considered as potential targets for therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Summary Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is the principal inductive site for mucosal immune responses that are capable of T and B cell responses and antigen-specific responses. In previous independent studies different structures of MALT, e.g. bronchus-, larynx- and nose-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT, LALT, NALT) have been described separately in various frequencies in the human respiratory tract over life spans. Because upper respiratory tract infections are common in infants, dysregulations of mucosal immune responses might be seriously involved in the aetiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the present study the coincidental occurrence of the three different MALT structures in the respiratory tract within the same patients were studied, and cases of SIDS and children who had died from different traumatic and natural causes of death (non-SIDS) were compared. First, the frequency of BALT and LALT in 46 children (35 SIDS, 11 non-SIDS) with or without NALT were examined. A tendency was found of a coincidence of respiratory MALT structures. In 50 additional cases of infant death (30 SIDS, 20 non-SIDS) from the multi-centric German Study on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (GeSID) where death had occurred in the first year of life, the coincidence was evaluated. A coincidental occurrence of BALT, LALT and NALT or BALT and LALT (each about 30%) was found in both groups, whereby the coincidence in SIDS and the control patients did not differ. Interestingly, the children with coincidental MALT were strikingly older, supporting the hypothesis of respiratory MALT formation via environmental stimulation over time.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in molecular biology, neurobiology, genetics, and imaging have demonstrated important insights about the nature of neurological diseases. However, a comprehensive understanding of their pathogenesis is still lacking. Although reductionism has been successful in enumerating and characterizing the components of most living organisms, it has failed to generate knowledge on how these components interact in complex arrangements to allow and sustain two of the most fundamental properties of the organism as a whole: its fitness, also termed its robustness, and its capacity to evolve. Systems biology complements the classic reductionist approaches in the biomedical sciences by enabling integration of available molecular, physiological, and clinical information in the context of a quantitative framework typically used by engineers. Systems biology employs tools developed in physics and mathematics such as nonlinear dynamics, control theory, and modeling of dynamic systems. The main goal of a systems approach to biology is to solve questions related to the complexity of living systems such as the brain, which cannot be reconciled solely with the currently available tools of molecular biology and genomics. As an example of the utility of this systems biological approach, network-based analyses of genes involved in hereditary ataxias have demonstrated a set of pathways related to RNA splicing, a novel pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. Network-based analysis is also challenging the current nosology of neurological diseases. This new knowledge will contribute to the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches, bringing the paradigm of personalized medicine one step closer to reality. Ann Neurol 2009;65:124?139

AB  - Abstract Antimicrobial properties of a long-chain, synthetic, cationic, and hydrophobic amino acid block copolymer are reported. In 5 and 60 min time-kill assays, solutions of K100L40 block copolymers (poly(l-lysine·hydrochloride)100-b-poly(l-leucine)40) at concentrations of 10?100 µg mL?1 show multi-log reductions in colony forming units of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeast, including multidrug-resistant strains. Driven by association of hydrophobic segments, K100L40 copolymers form viscous solutions and self-supporting hydrogels in water at concentrations of 1 and 2 wt%, respectively. These K100L40 preparations provide an effective barrier to microbial contamination of wounds, as measured by multi-log decreases of tissue-associated bacteria with deliberate inoculation of porcine skin explants, porcine open wounds, and rodent closed wounds with foreign body. Based on these findings, amino acid copolymers with the features of K100L40 can combine potent, direct antimicrobial activity and barrier properties in one biopolymer for a new approach to prevention of wound infections.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses common neurologic disorders related to specific bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It describes pathogens to which the elderly patient is more susceptible, along with specific differential diagnostic considerations in this patient population. In addition, the chapter discusses appropriate treatments and toxicities to which the elderly patient is more susceptible. An anatomopathologic approach is employed to facilitate syndrome recognition and differential diagnosis generation. The chapter talks about pathogen-specific immune responses because clinical manifestations of nervous system infections reflect complex interactions between specific pathogens and the immune system. Finally, it reviews immunosenescence (age-related changes in immune function) both generally and in the central nervous system (CNS) specifically.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.
