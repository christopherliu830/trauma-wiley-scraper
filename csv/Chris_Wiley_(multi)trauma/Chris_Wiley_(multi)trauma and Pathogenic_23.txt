AB  - A novel murine experimental wound infection model was used to assess the efficacy of multi-component immunization against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Necrotic lesions were induced in mice with venom from Bothrops asper and infected with a low inoculum, 1 ? 102 CFU. The wound infection model therefore more resembles a clinical case of S. aureus infection compared with conventional infection models where far more bacteria are required. Before infection, mice were immunized with four recombinant S.aureus proteins expressed from Escherichia coli: (i) domains 1?3 of Extracellular adherence protein (Eap), (ii) Efb ? D (fusion protein combining Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) and a fibronectin binding domain (D) of the fibronectin binding protein (FnBP) and (iii) clumping factor A (ClfA). In the immunized group, lower bacterial colonization, undisturbed crust formation and significantly faster wound healing were found compared with the unimmunized control group. Efb and Eap have previously been found to impair wound healing and neutralization of these proteins by antibodies restores a more natural wound healing process. This effect is further also enhanced by the proposed opsonic activity of antibodies against ClfA and FnBP.

AB  - Summary Ocular manifestations may develop in many systemic diseases of horses; however, signs may not be observed unless ophthalmological examination is specifically undertaken. Recognition and assessment of ocular lesions in horses with systemic disease is desirable to facilitate diagnosis and determination of treatment options and diagnosis for both the underlying systemic disease and ocular manifestations. The purpose of this article is to review systemic diseases of horses that may have ocular signs as part of the disease process. Systemic diseases are discussed in categories of pathways for development of ocular signs, namely immunological disease, neurological disease or local/systemic spread of disease.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Summary Heat injuries sustained in a fire can initiate a cascade of complex mechanisms that affect the physiology of trees after fires. Uncovering the exact physiological mechanisms and relating specific injuries to whole-plant and ecosystem functioning is the focus of intense current research. Recent studies have made critical steps forward in our understanding of tree physiological processes after fires, and have suggested mechanisms by which fire injuries may interact with disturbances such as drought, insects and pathogens. We outline a conceptual framework that unifies the involved processes, their interconnections, and possible feedbacks, and contextualizes these responses with existing hypotheses for disturbance effects on plants and ecosystems. By focusing on carbon and water as currencies of plant functioning, we demonstrate fire-induced cambium/phloem necrosis and xylem damage to be main disturbance effects. The resulting carbon starvation and hydraulic dysfunction are linked with drought and insect impacts. Evaluating the precise process relationships will be crucial for fully understanding how fires can affect tree functionality, and will help improve fire risk assessment and mortality model predictions. Especially considering future climate-driven increases in fire frequency and intensity, knowledge of the physiological tree responses is important to better estimate postfire ecosystem dynamics and interactions with climate disturbances.

AB  - Background: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease characterized by acantholysis in the epithelium. PV is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages, since the oral lesions are relatively nonspecific. We report on a case with a favorable outcome due to early diagnosis and effective treatment of oral lesions. Methods: A 53-year-old Japanese woman presented with a month-long history of painful gingiva. PV was diagnosed using clinical, histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence criteria 1 month after the first visit. Evaluation of the circulating autoantibody titers to desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3 was conducted by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occlusive steroid therapy (OST) using a topical corticosteroid (0.1% triamcinolone acetonide) was provided for 8 weeks. After OST was completed, a buccal frenectomy was performed to eliminate localized toothbrushing trauma. Results: There were no adverse effects on wound healing after the procedure. No oral PV lesions were detectable at the 9-month reevaluation, and the patient remains in complete remission. The Dsg1 ELISA was negative while the Dsg3 ELISA was indeterminate at the first visit. The Dsg1 ELISA was also negative at reevaluation, but Dsg3 ELISA reactivity had increased 9 months after completion of treatment. Conclusion: Large scale clinical trials will be required to validate the clinical benefits of the OST treatment regimen, and further research is necessary to determine the importance of ELISA antibody examination in long-term management of oral PV.

AB  - Objectives The objectives of this manuscript are two-fold: (a) to describe the clinical characteristics and management of four pediatric patients with bacterial endocarditis (BE) after Melody? pulmonary valve implantation (MPVI); and (b) to review the literature regarding Melody? pulmonary valve endocarditis. Background There are several reports of BE following MPVI. The clinical course, BE management and outcome remain poorly defined. Methods This is a multi-center report of four pediatric patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and BE after MPVI. Clinical presentation, echocardiogram findings, infecting organism, BE management, and follow-up assessment are described. We review available literature on Melody? pulmonary valve endocarditis and discuss the prognosis and challenges in the management of these patients. Results Of our four BE patients, two had documented vegetations and three showed worsening pulmonary stenosis. All patients remain asymptomatic after medical treatment (4) and surgical prosthesis replacement (3) at follow-up of 17 to 40 months. Analysis of published data shows that over half of patients undergo bioprosthesis explantation and that there is a 13% overall mortality. The most common BE pathogens are the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Conclusions Our case series of four pediatric patients with repaired TOF confirms a risk for BE after MPVI. A high index of suspicion for BE should be observed after MPVI. All patients should be advised to follow lifelong BE prophylaxis after MPVI. In case of BE, surgery should be considered for valve dysfunction or no clinical improvement in spite of medical treatment. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Summary Background Infectious respiratory disease is common in young horses and can impact athletic performance and long-term health. Significant variation in the duration of clinical disease has been observed, even in the absence of secondary complications. The determination of factors associated with disease chronicity may facilitate clinical decision-making and the development of improved biosecurity protocols. Objective To investigate contact network characteristics, and demographic variables associated with time to clinical recovery from Equine Rhinitis A virus respiratory disease. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Yearling Standardbred racehorses (n = 58) housed in a multi-barn training facility in Southern Ontario were included. Horses were monitored daily for clinical signs of acute respiratory disease over a 41-day period in Autumn 2017. Contact patterns between horses, including older racehorses, were determined through use of proximity loggers attached to halters during the initial 7-day of the study. Associations between duration of disease, demographic factors (birth month, gait, sex and yearling sale), serologic titres and network metrics (degree, betweenness and Eigenvector centrality) were investigated using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results Yearling attack rate for infectious respiratory disease was 87.9% (n = 51). Median time to recovery was 6 days (IQR = 1?32) and 17 horses were censored due to early withdrawal or failure to recover during the study period. In those yearlings born February?May, birth month was significant in the Cox proportional hazard model (Hazard Ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.49?1, P = 0.05). Main limitation Probability of censoring was not independent of outcome which necessitated use of sensitivity analysis. Conclusions These findings suggest late born foals are less likely to recover quickly from infectious respiratory disease.

AB  - Objective To review the intellectual history of concussion from the mid-19th century to the opening decade of the 21st century. Background Head injuries (HI) and their acute and long-term effects have been investigated for centuries, with major reviews of the topic appearing by 1870. Thus, while it has long been acknowledged that chronic traumatic encephalopathy was first described by Harrison Martland in 1928, an examination of the history of concussion research up to Martland's seminal report places his studies in a deeper historical context. This history makes clear that Martland's findings were one among many such studies showcasing the lasting dangers of blows to the head. In the years after Martland published his study, his paper was frequently cited in other papers that made clear that blows to the head, of all ranges of severity, were dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences. Methods The author has engaged in an historical analysis of the development and elaboration of concussion research in clinical medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, and those scientific disciplines related to clinical medicine. The author has found numerous primary sources from the history of medicine and science that describe the acute and chronic effects of single and repeated sub-concussive and concussive blows to the head. Results This study makes clear that evidence-based methodologies inevitably short-change the knowledge of past clinicians and scientists by holding these figures to normative standards of recent invention. What criticism of this kind fails to recognize is that past investigators, many of them pioneers in their fields, published their work in ways that matched the highest normative standards of their day for the presentation of evidence. Conclusions It has been recognized for a long time that concussions are dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences, ranging from permanent symptoms to degenerative neurological states. The intellectual history of medicine and science from 1870 to the recent past shows both a continuity of clinical observations about HI and a steady, incremental accumulation of knowledge refining our understanding of those observations from a remarkably wide sphere of scientific disciplines.

AB  - Summary Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease and may represent an emergency condition because of the detrimental effects of excess thyroid hormone on underlying heart abnormalities. When AIT represents an imminent risk for cardiac function, it should be managed without delay, because the late resolution of thyrotoxicosis is associated with a high mortality rate. Under these circumstances, emergent thyroidectomy may represent the most effective and rapid way to resolve thyrotoxicosis.

AB  - Abstract. 3 distinct levels are involved in the periodontal inflammatory process: site, tooth, and individual. By focusing attention on the levels in the population, multilevel or hierarchical modelling (MLM) enables the researcher to understand where and how the effects at the levels involved are occurring. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyse the progression of periodontal disease using analytical models that consider the level hierarchy. 22 patients with periodontitis, in previous reports described as either non-responsive or responsive to periodontal treatment, were investigated. In the multilevel modelling method (MLM), the site pocket probing depth (PPD) is summarised in 3 parameters: the overall mean, the between-individual variance, and the within-individual, between-site variance. The model can readily be extended to include independent variables for sites, teeth and individuals. If these variables are important determinants of PPD, their inclusion in the model will lead to a reduction in residual variances between sites, teeth and individuals. The PPDs were used for construction of a PPD change variable (cPPD). This variable, together with the final registrations of PPD (fPPD) alone, were used as dependent variables in the MLM. Independent predictor variables, 12 on site-level, 3 on tooth-level, and 19 on individual-level, were constructed. The total number of sites assessed was 2236 distributed on 559 teeth in 22 subjects. Initially, a fixed, fully unconditional model (models A and E) was assessed, where no predictor variables were specified at any level. Different random-intercept models (B-D, F-H) were then calculated where the independent variables were inserted in blocks relating to each level. The variance components at all 3 levels were significantly larger than zero. This indicates that MLM is recommended for analysing the present data. The inserted predictors showed 100% sensitivity relating to the subject-level variance. Subsequent testing of the patient with disease or at high risk of disease would have to focus on diagnostic tests aimed at the individual teeth and sites. These tests would need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity. Thus, by using multilevel modelling, the theoretical understanding of important factors in the pathogenesis of periodontitis is stimulated.

AB  - Abstract. The dab, Limanda limanda (L.), is a common species of flatfish found in the shallow waters of the North Sea, particularly in inshore regions. Because of its distribution and habits, it is a useful species for investigations into the biological effects of marine pollution; it is also susceptible to certain, easily-detectable, gross diseases, including a variety of hepatic lesions, some of which are putative neoplasias. Investigations over the past 10 years on the histopathology of dab livers, have revealed that many lesions are associated with parasitic infections or trauma, and others include the presence of basophilic foci and putative adenoma as well as cell storage changes. The significance of these lesions is discussed in relation to other biological and physical data, and the necessity for histological evaluation is emphasized.
