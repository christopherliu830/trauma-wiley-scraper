AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to establish a new experimental model of hematogenous implant-related infection (IRI) by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain. Cylindrical porous tantalum intramedullary implants were inserted in the proximal right tibia of 30 male white rabbits after administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Four weeks later and without antibiotic prophylaxis, 20 animals received 1 ml of inoculum of two different concentrations (study groups A and B) of CA-MRSA strain through an ipsilatelar femoral artery catheter. The remaining 10 received normal saline instead (control group C). Surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later. Sterile bone, bone marrow biopsies, and implants were harvested for culture and histological evaluation. Ten animals receiving 5???108cfu/ml (group A) died within 48?72 h due to septic shock. Blood cultures were positive; histology demonstrated acute infection. Ten animals received bacterial load of 3???108cfu/ml (group B) and all survived; two had negative Gram-stain and cultures but PCR and RT-PCR results demonstrated the viability of the microorganisms, while periprosthetic osteolysis and histological evaluation indicated subacute osteomyelitis; eight animals established periprosthetic infection, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis documented by positive Gram-stain, cultures, subperiosteal reaction, and chronic infection on histology. Control group specimens demonstrated no signs of infection. Histopathological semiquantitative scoring was used to compare the three groups. Comparison of groups A and B with control group and between group A and B showed statistically significant difference (p?<?0.05) in all parameters except for periosteal reaction between groups B and C (p?=?0.354). This novel, reproducible experimental model will facilitate the study of hematogenous CA-MRSA IRIs. ? 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Circulating histones are a newly recognized mediator implicated in various inflammatory diseases. It is likely that the release of histones, from dying hepatocytes or inflammatory leukocytes, into the circulation initiates and amplifies inflammation during the course of acute liver failure (ALF). In this study, we investigated a putative pathogenic role of circulating histones in a murine model of ALF induced by D-galactosamine (GalN) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hepatic function and histological indexes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, hepatocyte apoptosis and the levels of circulating histone were measured in GalN/LPS-treated mice. GalN/LPS caused severe liver damage and a notable increase in plasma concentration of circulating histones. To further assess the role of circulating histones in our model, we administered exogenous histones and anti-histone H4 antibody. Notably, exogenous histones aggravated GalN/LPS-induced hepatotoxicity, whereas anti-histone antibody significantly protected mice. Circulating histones may serve as both a functional marker of ALF activity and as an inflammatory mediator contributing to the progression of ALF. Blockade of circulating histones shows potent protective effects, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for ALF. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 2384?2391, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract? Despite the best efforts of influenza scientists, companies and health officials to prepare for the next pandemic, most of the world?s people will not have access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. They will have to rely on 19th century public health ?technologies? to see them through. In the 21st century, science ought to be able to provide something better. Influenza scientists study the molecular characteristics of influenza viruses and their signaling effects in cell culture and animal models of infection. While these studies have been enormously informative, they have been unable to explain the system-wide effects of influenza on the host, the increased mortality of younger adults in the 1918 influenza pandemic and the much lower mortality rates in children who were more commonly infected with the 1918 virus. Experiments by non-influenza scientists have defined common cell signaling pathways for acute lung injury caused by different agents, including inactivated H5N1 influenza virus. These pathways include several molecular targets that are up-regulated in acute lung injury and down-regulated by anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, including statins, fibrates, and glitazones. These agents also help reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies multi-organ failure, something often seen in fatal Influenza. Observational studies suggest that statins are beneficial in treating patients with pneumonia (there are no such studies for fibrates and glitazones). Other studies suggest that these agents might be able to ?roll back? the self-damaging host response of young adults to the less damaging response of children and thus save lives. Research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other agents that modify the host response might be useful in managing H5N1 influenza and the next pandemic.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? In the last ten years both analysts and neuroscientists have begun to challenge the analytic world to explore the analytic view of the mind in relation to knowledge emerging from the field of neuroscience. I find that ?in many ways it is Jung's understanding of the mind, the human condition, and the self, that is most compatible with the insights that are emerging from neuroscience today? (Wilkinson 2004, p. 84). In this paper I consider the insights that neuroscience has to offer us as we seek to work with those patients whose early experience has diminished their capacity to be ?in mind? and with it their capacity for reflective self-function, whose defences are dissociative, whose need has been to keep unbearable experience at bay, out of mind. I look first at dissociationist theory and its development, then focus on the insights to be gained from neuroscience with regard to early trauma and its effect on the encoding and recall of memory. Finally, I turn to the nature of cure and argue that hemispheric integration is the key to undoing dissociation and the prelude to individuation.

AB  - Abstract Foot infections are common in persons with diabetes and are often the proximate cause of lower extremity amputation. There have been many publications in the past few years dealing with the appropriate ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections. This review presents information gathered from a comprehensive, ongoing surveillance of the literature (published and abstracts) over the past 4 years. Prospective studies have now defined the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections, as well as methods to score and classify the wounds. Several recently published guidelines can assist clinicians in managing these infections. The etiologic agents of infection have been well-defined, and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistance pathogens is growing. Molecular methods offer great promise for quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of infection. New antimicrobial agents, both systemic and topical, as well as novel local treatments, have been shown to be effective in various studies. Improved methods of deploying older agents have added to the variety of treatment approaches now available. Several adjunctive treatments may benefit some patients but their role is as yet unclear. While there is much yet to learn about the most cost-effective ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections the main effort is now to disseminate the available information and facilitate employing the evidence-based guideline recommendations.

AB  - In a tripartite exploration of the effects of traumatic breakage in the parasitic clonal plant Cuscuta corymbosa, experimental breakage had significant negative effects upon stem extension of ramets distal to a break and the level of that effect depended upon the number of ramets in the severed fragment. Regular monitoring of clonal individuals transplanted onto naturally occurring, native host species revealed that breakage in individuals growing under natural conditions ranged from 2 to 66% of all interramet connections and significantly affected distance between ramets and stolon generation in ramets associated with a break. Simulations revealed that these responses to breakage would significantly change the ?shape? of a clonal individual in a manner capable of affecting probabilities of encounter with patchily distributed resources. Nonetheless, the observed levels of breakage had no discernible effect on biomass accumulation, although individuals that survived into the dry season and thus gained the potential to reproduce in additional seasons had a significantly lower rate of breakage than those that did not. We suggest that the lack of a relationship between breakage and within-season biomass accumulation is an indication that parasite response to breakage is gauged to expected levels of breakage for the habitat. We note that the capacity of ramets to survive disconnection significantly decreased the loss of tissue that would occur if subunits did not possess the potential to function independently.

AB  - Abstract Background Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis usually results from traumatic inoculation with the fungus and generally occurs in immunosuppressed men. Cladosporium, Exophiala, and Alternaria spp. are commonly implicated pathogens. Objectives We present a case of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by Rhytidhysteron sp. that was refractory to conventional antifungal therapy. Case report A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presented with a multiloculated, large cystic swelling over the right dorsal foot. Laboratory findings and x-rays of the chest and left foot were normal. Results Adequate control of the patient's diabetes was achieved, and the swelling was excised under itraconazole/terbinafine coverage. Histology showed multiple areas of neutrophilic abscess, epithelioid cells, foreign body giant cells, and multiple septate hyphae and yeast-like cells. Dematiaceous fungus was cultured but failed to produce spores. Sequencing of the isolate showed a match of > 99% with Rhytidhysteron rufulum. The patient demonstrated no response after one year of therapy with itraconazole/terbinafine. Weekly infiltration of the lesion with liposomal amphotericin B resulted in its complete resolution within 15 weeks. Conclusions Lesions of phaeohyphomycosis appear morphologically similar regardless of the organism implicated. Hence, their diagnosis rests entirely on the clinicopathological and microbiological presentation. Molecular studies may be required to identify a fungus if attempts to grow it in artificial culture media fail. Rhytidhysteron spp. are not known as pathogens in humans, and no treatment protocol exists. Intralesional amphotericin was highly effective in our patient and caused no systemic adverse effects. Voriconazole and posaconazole are effective against disseminated/visceral phaeohyphomycotic infections, but their efficacy against Rhytidhysteron spp. remains unstudied.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 92?101. Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.

AB  - Objectives To assess the prevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in a population of dogs with a diagnosis of suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis. Materials and Methods Medical records of three referral centres were reviewed from 2008 to 2016 to identify a cohort of dogs diagnosed and treated for suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis after testing for evidence of exposure to these pathogens. Results In our sample of 400 dogs the prevalence for exposure (IgG>1:50) to Toxoplasma gondii was 8/201 (3∙98%). Active infection (IgG titre >1:400 or/and an IgM titre >1:64 and/or positive PCR in CSF) was suspected in 1/400 (0∙25%). The prevalence for exposure [Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titre >1:50] and active infection (IFA titres ≥?1:400 and/or positive PCR in CSF) with Neospora caninum were 14/201 (6∙96%) and 9/400 (2∙25%), respectively. Clinical Significance In view of the low prevalence of protozoan infections, the risk associated with starting immunosuppressive medication in dogs with evidence of inflammatory meningitis or encephalitis in the UK appears low.
