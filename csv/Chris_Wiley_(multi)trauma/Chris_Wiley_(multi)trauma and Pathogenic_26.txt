AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common disorder that affects 3% of the general population. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is less common, with about 1% of adults in the US meeting the current CDC criteria for case definition. Both conditions are controversial because they do not fit either a strictly physical or psychological concept of disease. Their symptoms overlap and they share many clinical features with irritable bowel syndrome, atypical migraine and muscle tension headaches, multiple chemical sensitivities, interstitial cystitis and multiple allergies syndrome, all poorly understood entities. This review provides an historical perspective on both disorders and presents the clinical features and differential diagnoses. The relative success of current classification criteria is discussed. Pathogenic mechanisms are presented, including the relationship of FM and CFS to depression and other psychiatric diseases and the possibility that they may be ?diseases constructs? called ?memes? that are invented by physicians. A cognitive-behavioral approach to treatment is presented that emphasizes the roles of education, stress reduction, improvement of sleep, exercise and the effective use of analgesics, antidepressants and other psychoactive medications.

AB  - Summary Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile human pathogen causing diseases ranging from uncomplicated mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive disease. The development of human-relevant animal models of GAS infection and introduction of new technologies have markedly accelerated the pace of discoveries related to GAS host?pathogen interactions. For example, recently investigators have identified pili on the GAS cell surface and learned that they are key components for adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. Similarly, the recent development of a transgenic mouse expressing human plasminogen has resulted in new understanding of the molecular processes contributing to invasive infection. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GAS pharyngeal, invasive and other infections holds the promise of assisting with the development of novel preventive or therapeutic agents for this prevalent human pathogen.

AB  - Summary Thrombocytopenia?a pathological reduction in platelet count?has five major explanations: decreased platelet production, hemodilution (usually postoperative), sequestration (hypersplenism), increased platelet consumption, and increased platelet destruction. Consumptive thrombocytopenic disorders include thrombin-mediated (disseminated intravascular coagulation), septicemia, and thrombotic microangiopathy (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome), whereas platelet destruction infers increased platelet clearance due to platelet-reactive autoantibodies, alloantibodies, or drug-dependent antibodies. The adverse drug reaction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, combines these concepts of platelet consumption and destruction, as the pathogenic antibodies bind to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes on platelet surfaces, but results in increased platelet activation, hypercoagulability, and a prothrombotic state. When faced with a thrombocytopenic patient, the clinician must ask: what is the probable cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia? The answer to that question indicates whether the patient's major risk is bleeding, thrombosis, or increased mortality (due to multiorgan dysfunction), and what the appropriate therapies might be.

AB  - Abstract Plant natural products derived from phenylalanine and the phenylpropanoid pathway are impressive in their chemical diversity and are the result of plant evolution, which has selected for the acquisition of large repertoires of pigments, structural and defensive compounds, all derived from a phenylpropanoid backbone via the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. These compounds are important in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses and thus can have large impacts on agricultural productivity. While plant-based medicines containing phenylpropanoid-derived active components have long been used by humans, the benefits of specific flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds to human health and their potential for long-term health benefits have been only recognized more recently. In this part of the review, we discuss the diversity and biosynthetic origins of phenylpropanoids and particularly of the flavonoid and stilbenoid natural products. We then review data pertaining to the modes of action and biological properties of these compounds, referring on their effects on human health and physiology and their roles as plant defense and antimicrobial compounds. This review continues in Part II discussing the use of biotechnological tools targeting the rational reconstruction of multienzyme pathways in order to modify the production of such compounds in plants and model microbial systems for the benefit of agriculture and forestry.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mast cells, important sensor and effector cells of the immune system, may influence bone metabolism as their number is increased in osteoporotic patients. They are also present during bone fracture healing with currently unknown functions. Using a novel c-Kit-independent mouse model of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrated that mast cells did not affect physiological bone turnover. However, they triggered local and systemic inflammation after fracture by inducing release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of innate immune cells. In later healing stages, mast cells accumulated and regulated osteoclast activity to remodel the bony fracture callus. Furthermore, they were essential to induce osteoclast formation after ovariectomy. Additional in vitro studies revealed that they promote osteoclastogenesis via granular mediators, mainly histamine. In conclusion, mast cells are redundant in physiologic bone turnover but exert crucial functions after challenging the system, implicating mast cells as a potential target for treating inflammatory bone disorders. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Objective To report prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes for presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnosed among an emergency-care population of UK dogs. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design using emergency-care veterinary clinical records from the VetCompass Programme spanning September 1, 2012 to February 28, 2014 and risk factor analysis using multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The study population comprised 77,088 dogs attending 50 Vets Now clinics. Overall, 492 dogs had presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnoses, giving a prevalence of 0Â·64% (95% Confidence interval: 0Â·58 to 0Â·70%). Compared with cross-bred dogs, breeds with the highest odds ratios for the diagnosis of presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus were the great Dane (odds ratio: 114Â·3, 95% Confidence interval 55Â·1 to 237Â·1, P<0Â·001), akita (odds ratio: 84Â·4, 95% Confidence interval 33Â·6 to 211Â·9, P<0Â·001) and dogue de Bordeaux (odds ratio: 82Â·9, 95% Confidence interval 39Â·0 to 176Â·3, P<0Â·001). Odds increased as dogs aged up to 12 years and neutered male dogs had 1Â·3 (95% Confidence interval 1Â·0 to 1Â·8, P=0Â·041) times the odds compared with entire females. Of the cases that were presented alive, 49Â·7% survived to discharge overall, but 79Â·3% of surgical cases survived to discharge. Clinical Significance Approximately 80% of surgically managed cases survived to discharge. Certain large breeds were highly predisposed.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the sepsis and the inflammatory response to injury. Higher doses of corticosteroids have been shown to be harmful in severe sepsis. Early administration of antibiotics has been shown to have a significant impact on outcomes with sepsis. The coagulation system plays an important role in the sepsis-induced inflammatory cascade. Coagulation is activated by the inflammatory reaction to tissue injury and is activated independent of the type of microbe (e.g., gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites). Coagulation induced by inflammation can in turn contribute to further inflammation. Depletion of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factors contributes to the microvascular deposition of fibrin that is associated with organ dysfunction. Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis contribute significantly to organ dysfunction and death.

AB  - Abstract Bats are becoming increasingly important as an experimental model due to their unique biological features. These include the ability of powered flight, minimal consequences from a heightened metabolic state, extended longevity in most species and minimal inflammation in response to most otherwise pathogenic viruses. To date there has been limited work done on the optimal procedures for necropsy, extraction of tissues or preparation of cell suspensions for downstream experimental work. Here we use Pteropus alecto black flying fox as an example model of the fruit bat to develop optimal procedures for anaesthetizing, necropsy methods, safety, sequence and protocols for cell/tissue extraction and isolation protocols. These methods were successfully used to yield high-quality RNA, DNA and protein samples from tissues along with viable cells for various molecular and immunological studies. Procedures utilized are suitable for comparative biology studies with most protocols being directly modified from those used in mice and humans. While mainly optimized for the larger fruit bats (flying foxes) in this study, the majority of protocols can readily be adapted to all species of bats. This study provides the framework for greater consistency with in vivo bat experiments, application for comparative biology studies and greater engagement of the bat community for suitable protocols to be harmoniously adopted.

AB  - Objective To compare the antibacterial efficacy of different surgical hand antisepsis protocols used by veterinary students. Study Design Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Study Population Third year veterinary students (n=45). Methods The participants were randomly assigned to 4 of the following 12 hand preparation product/time combinations: nonabrasive hand scrub method with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CH); hand rub with a mixture of 30% 1-propanol and 45% 2-propanol solution (MPS), 70% 2-propanol solution (IPS), or 61% ethanol solution with 1% chlorhexidine gluconate (ES/CH), with a contact time of 1.5, 3, or 5 minutes. Antibacterial efficacy was assessed after surgical hand preparation and at the end of surgery. Log reductions of total bacterial colony forming unit (CFU)/mL and positive aerobic culture rates were compared using multivariable analysis of variance and multivariable logistic regression, respectively. Results After surgical hand preparation, CH and ES/CH provided significantly higher log CFU reduction and lower positive culture rate for Gram-positive and spore-forming bacteria compared to MPS and IPS. Increase in contact time did not provide significant improvement in bacterial reduction. At the end of surgery, ES/CH provided significantly higher log CFU reduction compared to IPS and lower positive culture rate for Gram-positive bacteria compared to CH, MPS, and IPS. Increase in contact time significantly improved log CFU reduction in ES/CH and MPS groups. Conclusion In our population of veterinary students ES/CH hand rubs or CH scrubs were more effective in reducing bacterial CFU during surgical hand preparation than MPS or IPS.

PY  - 1997
AB  - Abstract The majority of contemporary endosseous dental implant systems are based on designs and materials that, over the last three decades, have proved to be predictably reliable. With proper surgical and prosthetic protocols, rates of implant loss have been held to 15% or less over a 5-year period. This information was obtained largely through longitudinal descriptive studies, primarily aimed at obtaining implant survival rates under ideal clinical conditions, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for admitting patients into the studies. It is important to emphasize that under conditions of routine clinical practice, where patient selection may be more relaxed than in clinical trials and clinicians attempt to stretch the limits of current technology, the survival rates may not necessarily match those reported in the literature. Since ?surviving? implants may exhibit characteristics likely to lead to eventual loss of the implant, for example severe osseous defects, such implants may not necessarily be considered successful. Successful implants should fulfill a list of other criteria considered essential for long-term survival. Differences in implant design preclude some of these criteria from being uniformly applied to all systems. There is a need to identify criteria for success that can be applied to the majority of implant systems. Implants that fail to meet these criteria should be considered failures. Since failure rates may include ?failed? as well as ?failing? (?ailing?) implants, the two categories should be listed separately. From a practical standpoint, implant failures can be grouped into ?early? failures, primarily the result of surgical and/or postoperative complications, and ?late? failures that arise during and following the restorative phase. The ability of individual systems to achieve excellent success rates, despite some major differences in their design from other systems, suggests that some requirements, initially considered essential for success, may not be as critical as originally believed. Examples include the need for submerging implants during initial wound healing or the need for stress breaking devices. On the other hand, a basic requirement for implant success, such as primary stability at the time of insertion and following loading of the implant, may be the unifying principle behind the need for adequate bone volume and density, longer or wider implants, and the 3 to 6-month delay recommended before implants are placed in function. With relatively low failure rates, a large number of patients may have to be included in long-term clinical trials before a statistically significant association can be established between failure rates and potential contributing factors. For the same reasons, and to avoid type 2 errors, large populations may be needed to show that two systems have comparable success rates. Proving the superiority of one system over another may require fewer subjects. Given the overall low failure rate and the tendency of failures to cluster in individual subjects, failure rates could be markedly affected by the attrition of a few critical subjects. Additional research is needed to validate methods in current use for the clinical determination of osseointegration, and the diagnosis and treatment of occlusal trauma and microbial infections around implants. Also, more reliable methods are needed for the identification of the primary cause(s) of implant morbidity; i.e., infection or occlusal factors. Ann Periodontol 1997;2: 299?313.

AB  - Abstract Our objectives are to quickly interpret symptoms of emergency patients to identify likely syndromes and to improve population-wide disease outbreak detection. We constructed a database of 248 syndromes, each syndrome having an estimated probability of producing any of 85 symptoms, with some two-way, three-way, and five-way probabilities reflecting correlations among symptoms. Using these multi-way probabilities in conjunction with an iterative proportional fitting algorithm allows estimation of full conditional probabilities. Combining these conditional probabilities with misdiagnosis error rates and incidence rates via Bayes theorem, the probability of each syndrome is estimated. We tested a prototype of computer-aided differential diagnosis (CADDY) on simulated data and on more than 100 real cases, including West Nile Virus, Q fever, SARS, anthrax, plague, tularaemia and toxic shock cases. We conclude that: (1) it is important to determine whether the unrecorded positive status of a symptom means that the status is negative or that the status is unknown; (2) inclusion of misdiagnosis error rates produces more realistic results; (3) the naive Bayes classifier, which assumes all symptoms behave independently, is slightly outperformed by CADDY, which includes available multi-symptom information on correlations; as more information regarding symptom correlations becomes available, the advantage of CADDY over the naive Bayes classifier should increase; (4) overlooking low-probability, high-consequence events is less likely if the standard output summary is augmented with a list of rare syndromes that are consistent with observed symptoms, and (5) accumulating patient-level probabilities across a larger population can aid in biosurveillance for disease outbreaks.
