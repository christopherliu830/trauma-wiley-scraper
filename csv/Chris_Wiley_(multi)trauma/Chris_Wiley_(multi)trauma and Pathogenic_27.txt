AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - Abstract The in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) is now a powerful technique in biomedical research, especially for tracking specific cells in circulatory system. The current fluorescence-based IVFC is limited to visible spectrum, while near infrared (NIR) dyes have their advantages, such as deeper penetration, less absorption and less scattering for NIR fluorescence. Here, using an NIR in vivo flow cytometer with a 785 nm laser excitation, the measurement of fluorescent dye IR-780 labeled circulating cells is demonstrated. Representative peaks corresponding to NIR fluorescent circulating cells are detected and quantified. In addition, blood flow information, including the blood flow velocity and flow volume per unit time, is obtained. By simultaneous detection of IR-780 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) signals from dual labeled cells, the IR-780 is shown to be a suitable fluorescent dye for multicolor detection by IVFC, including NIR. Thus, the IVFC is extended to the NIR range and shows potential application in biomedical research. ? 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. It is essential for a practitioner to understand oxygen delivery and how it can be optimized when providing adequate hemodynamic support in the critically ill patient. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume. Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly and shallow. Multiple factors can affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry monitors. CO-oximetry is a four wavelength non-invasive monitoring system that allows additional measurements of blood constituents. It not only measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as pulse oximetry does, but also dyshemoglobins. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can help identify problems immediately after intubation and before critical hypoxemia becomes manifest. Adding lactate determinations to oxygen transport monitoring provides a more complete assessment of tissue oxygenation.

AB  - Abstract The practice of an infectious diseases (ID) physician is evolving. A contemporary understanding of the frequency and variety of patients and syndromes seen by ID services has implications for training, service development and setting research priorities. We performed a 2-week prospective survey of formal ID physician activities related to direct inpatient care, encompassing 53 hospitals throughout Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, and documented 1722 inpatient interactions. Infections involving the skin and soft tissue, respiratory tract and bone/joints together accounted for 49% of all consultations. Suspected/confirmed pathogens were primarily bacterial (60%), rather than viral (6%), fungal (4%), mycobacterial (2%) or parasitic (1%). Staphylococcus aureus was implicated in 409 (24%) episodes, approximately four times more frequently than the next most common pathogen. The frequency of healthcare-related infections (35%), immunosuppression (21%), diabetes mellitus (19%), prosthesis-related infections (13%), multiresistant pathogens (13%) and non-infectious diagnoses (9%) was high, although consultation characteristics varied between geographical settings and hospital types. Our study highlights the diversity of inpatient-related ID activities and should direct future teaching and research. ID physicians' ability to offer beneficial consultative advice requires broad understanding of, and ability to interact with, a wide range of referring specialities.

AB  - We sought to determine the international experience with the quadripolar diaphragm pacer system and to test two hypotheses: the incidence of pacer complications would be (1) increased among pediatric as compared to adult patients; and (2) highest among active pediatric patients with idiopathic congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Data were collected via a questionnaire coupled with the Atrotech Registry data for a total of 64 patients (35 children and 29 adults) from 14 countries. Thoracic implantation of electrodes and bilateral pacer use each occurred in 94% of all subjects. Tetraplegic (vs pediatric CCHS) patients were more typically paced 24 hours/day (P = 0.001). Pacing duration averaged 2.0 ± 1.0 years among children and 2.2 ± 1.1 years among adults. Infections occurred among 2.9% of surgical procedures, all in pediatric CCHS patients (vs pediatric tetraplegic patients, P = 0.01). The incidence of mechanical trauma was 3.8%, without significant differences among patient groups. The incidence of presumed electrode and receiver failure were 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively, with internal component failure greater among pediatric CCHS than pediatric tetraplegic patients (P < 0.01). Intermittent or absent function of 0?4 electrode combinations occurred among 19% of all patients, with increased frequency among pediatric CCHS than pediatric tetraplegic patients (P < 0.03). Complication- free successful pacing occurred in 60% of pediatric and 52% of adult patients. In all, 94 % of the pediatric and 86% of the adult patients paced successfully after the necessary intervention. Although pacer complications were not increased among pediatric as compared to adult patients, the incidence of complications was highest among the active pediatric patients with CCHS. Longitudinal study of these patients will provide invaluable information for modification and improvement of the quadripolar system.

AB  - Infected tissues in the feet of people with diabetes in the form of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) present a complex pathology for clinicians to manage. This is partly attributed to the multi-factorial nature of the disease, which may include; altered foot architecture leading to excessive plantar pressures and frictional forces peripheral arterial disease and loss of protective sensation. In addition, to the above co-morbid variables, it is understood that a delayed wound healing state may be perpetuated by the presence of microorganisms residing in the wound tissue. The microbiology of chronic DFUs has often been reported as being polymicrobial. Of growing interest is the presence and potential role of anaerobic microorganisms in the pathology of DFUs and how they may contribute to the infective process or delayed healing. The presence of anaerobes in DFUs has been greatly underestimated, largely due to the limitations of conventional culture methods in identifying them from samples. Advancements in molecular and microscopy techniques have extended our view of the wound microbiome in addition to observing the growth and behaviour (planktonic or biofilm) of microorganisms in situ. This review paper will reflect on the evidence for the role and significance of anaerobes in DFUs and infection. A focus of this review will be to explore recent advancements in molecular genomics and microscopy techniques in order to better assess the roles of anaerobic bacteria in chronic DFUs and in biofilm-based wound care.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 1052?1063. Abstract Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) improve functional outcome in a number of disease models through suppression of inflammation. However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Chronic inflammation is known to promote the development of many chronic diseases. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins (NODs) mediate both infection-induced inflammation and sterile inflammation by recognizing pathogen- associated molecular patterns and endogenous molecules, respectively. PRR-mediated inflammation is an important determinant in altering the risk of many chronic diseases. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) can activate PRRs, leading to enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory target gene products. However, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit agonist-induced activation of PRRs. These results suggest that SFAs and n-3 PUFAs can reciprocally modulate PRR-mediated inflammation, and that PRRs and their downstream signaling components are molecular targets for dietary strategies to reduce chronic inflammation and subsequent risk of chronic diseases. This advancement in knowledge provides a new paradigm for understanding the mechanism by which different dietary fatty acids modify risk of chronic diseases including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and cancer.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.
