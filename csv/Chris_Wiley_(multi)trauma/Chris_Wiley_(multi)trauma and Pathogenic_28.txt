AB  - Abstract The conceptualization of predisposition to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders(PTSD) is summarized by three models: (1) predisposition due to preexisting psychopathology, (2) predisposition due to preexisting traits or characteristics considered normal, and (3) predisposition due to preexisting experience of specified stressors in family of origin. The investigation reported can be subsumed under the third model. The study involved the exploration of major stressors found in families of origin of 40 veterans, 20 who later developed PTSD and 20 who did not develop PTSD, with key demographic and military service variables balanced across groups. Additionally, the study focused on childhood perceptions of major stressors in family of origin. Findings suggest PTSD veterans had greater childhood stress related to parental alcoholism and unemployment than did non-PTSD counterparts. Further, the data suggest two major sets of childhood perceptions separate the two groups of veterans: (1) parental alcoholism/unemployment in the perception of PTSD participants, and (2) parental strictness/delegation of responsibility in the perception of non-PTSD participants. Methodological refinements are discussed that are needed to better hone in on the connection between family system stressors during primary socialization, subsequent phenomenology, and risk for PTSD.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Summary Intestinal nematodes are an important cause of equine disease. Of these parasites, the Cyathostominae are the most important group, both in terms of their prevalence and their pathogenicity. Cyathostomin infections are complex and control is further complicated by ever-increasing levels of resistance to some of the commonly used anthelmintics. There are no new equine anthelmintics under development, so it is imperative that the efficacy of any currently-effective drug classes be maintained for as long as possible. It is believed that the proportion of refugia (i.e. the percentage of parasites not exposed to a drug at each treatment) is one of the most crucial factors in determining the rate at which anthelmintic resistance develops. It is important, therefore, that levels of refugia be taken into account when designing nematode control programmes for horses. This can be assisted by knowledge of the local epidemiology of the infection, supplemented by faecal egg count analysis to identify those animals that are making the major contribution to pasture contamination. This type of rational nematode control requires equine veterinary surgeons to get involved in designing and implementing deworming programmes. The advice given must be based on a combination of knowledge of cyathostomin biology and epidemiology as well as an awareness of the parasite population's current drug sensitivity and a sound history of husbandry at the establishment. As anthelmintic resistance will be the major constraint on the future control of cyathostomins, researchers are now actively investigating this area. Studies are underway to develop tests that will enable earlier detection of anthelmintic resistance and an assay that will help identify those horses that require anthelmintic treatments targeted at intestinal wall larvae.

AB  - Abstract Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common type of carcinoma worldwide. The pathogenic pathways involved in this cancer are mostly unknown; therefore, a better characterization of the OSCC gene expression profile would represent a considerable advance. The public availability of gene expression datasets was meant to obtain new insights on biological processes. Methods We integrated 4 public microarray datasets on OSCC to evaluate the degree of consistency among the biological results obtained in these different studies and to identify common regulatory pathways that could be responsible for tumor growth. Results Twelve altered cellular pathways implicated in OSCC and 4 genes altered in the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor pathway were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Conclusion Using 4 expression array datasets, we have developed a robust method for analyzing pathways altered in OSCC. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2011

AB  - Summary Background Opioid use is epidemic in cirrhosis, which could precipitate hepatic encephalopathy (HE) potentially through gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Aim To define the effect of opioids on readmissions and on gut microbiota composition and functionality. Methods Cohort 1 had 200 cirrhotic in-patients (with/without opioid use) followed prospectively through the index hospitalisation and 6Â months post discharge. Readmissions (HE-related/unrelated) were compared between patients discharged on opioids compared to the rest, including using a multi-variable analysis. Cohort 2 consisted of 72 cirrhotics on chronic opioids who were age/model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and prior HE-balanced with 72 cirrhotics not on opioids. Stool microbiota composition (multi-tagged sequencing), predicted functionality (PiCRUST), endotoxemia and systemic inflammation (IL-6, IL-17) were compared. Results Cohort 1: Chronic opioid use was statistically similar between those admitted with/without HE, and was judged to be an HE precipitant in <5% of cases during the index hospitalisation. Of the 144 patients alive at 6Â months, 82 were readmitted. The opioid users had a significantly higher all cause (69% vs. 48%, PÂ =Â 0.008), but not HE-related readmissions (30% vs. 41%, PÂ =Â 0.30). On regression, opioid therapy and female gender were predictive of readmission independent of MELD score and previous HE. Cohort 2: Significant dysbiosis was noted in the opioid cohort, especially in HE+opioid patients with lower autochthonous taxa and Bacteroidaceae relative abundance. PiCRUST showed highest aromatic amino acid and endotoxin production in opioid users. Opioid users also had higher endotoxemia and IL-6 but not IL-17. Conclusion Chronic opioid use in cirrhosis is associated with increased endotoxemia, dysbiosis and all-cause readmissions.

AB  - Our objective was to elucidate how culture influences internal (psychological), external (social), institutional (structural), and health care (medical) processes, which, taken together, create differential risk of comorbidity across contexts. To develop a conceptual model, we conducted qualitative research with 13 female child soldiers in Nepal. Participants gave open-ended responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) vignettes (marital rape, emotional abuse, violence during pregnancy). Twelve participants (92%) endorsed personal responses (remaining silent, enduring violence, forgiving the husband). Twelve participants endorsed communication with one's husband. Only four participants (31%) sought family support, and three contacted police. Ultimately, 12 participants left the relationship, but the majority (nine) only left after the final IPV experience, which was preceded by prolonged psychological suffering and pregnancy endangerment. In conclusion, comorbidity risks are increased in cultural context that rely on individual or couples-only behavior, lack external social engagement, have weak law and justice institutions, and have limited health services.

AB  - ABSTRACT Computered tomography of the head was carried out on 35 patients who received a hospital diagnosis of delirium according to the DSM-III, and 25 controls without cognitive disturbance. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean age of the groups or in the cortical atrophy score as measured by the mean width of the four largest sulci in the three uppermost tomographic cuts. Instead, the delirious patients differed from the controls in the frontal horn and cella media indices, in the width of the third ventricle and Sylvian fissure at insula on the left side. There was also a significant excess of low attenuation, brain infarct-type areas in the delirious patients. The study confirms the marked predisposing role of the structural brain diseases (primary degenerative and multi-infarct type dementias, Parkinsonism) in the development of acute delirium in elderly patients.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

AB  - Radio-activated gene therapy has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer; however, expression of therapeutic gene in peritumoral tissues will result in unacceptable toxicity to normal cells. To restrict gene expression in targeted tumor mass, we used hypoxia and radiation tolerance features of tumor cells to develop a synthetic AND gate genetic circuit through connecting radiation sensitivity promoter cArG6, heat shock response elements SNF1, HSF1 and HSE4 with retroviral vector plxsn. Their construction and dynamic activity process were identified through downstream enhanced green fluorescent protein and wtp53 expression in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and in a nude mice model. The result showed that AND gate genetic circuit could be activated by lower required radiation dose (6Â Gy) and after activated, AND gate could induce significant apoptosis effects and growth inhibition of cancer cells inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. The radiation- and hypoxia-activated AND gate genetic circuit, which could lead to more powerful target tumoricidal activity represented a promising strategy for both targeted and effective gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma and low dose activation character of the AND gate genetic circuit implied that this model could be further exploited to decrease side-effects of clinical radiation therapy.

AB  - Summary Myriads of wound-care products are on the market, and making the right choice for a specific wound can be complex, especially because the scientific literature on wound-care products in horses is sparse. To select the best possible dressing, the veterinarian must decide which material is needed to enhance healing. The clinician must then determine if antimicrobial therapy is required. Several antibacterial compounds are available for topical use and are often more effective than systemically administered antibiotics in the management of severe contamination, critical colonization, or infection. To serve the requirements of specific wounds, several combinations of antimicrobial drugs and dressings are available. The wound milieu changes as healing progresses and so do the requirements for dressings. Continued assessment, based on a thorough clinical examination and sound knowledge of the healing process, is indicated, therefore, to maintain an optimal environment for healing.

AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20Â years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.

AB  - Abstract Advances in biomanufacturing techniques have opened the doors to recapitulate human sensory organs such as the nose and ear in vitro with adequate levels of functionality. Such advancements have enabled simultaneous targeting of two challenges in engineered sensory organs, especially the nose: i) mechanically robust reconstruction of the nasal cartilage with high precision and ii) replication of the nose functionality: odor perception. Hybrid nasal organs can be equipped with remarkable capabilities such as augmented olfactory perception. Herein, a proof-of-concept for an odor-perceptive nose-like hybrid, which is composed of a mechanically robust cartilage-like construct and a biocompatible biosensing platform, is proposed. Specifically, 3D cartilage-like tissue constructs are created by multi-material 3D bioprinting using mechanically tunable chondrocyte-laden bioinks. In addition, by optimizing the composition of stiff and soft bioinks in macro-scale printed constructs, the competence of this system in providing improved viability and recapitulation of chondrocyte cell behavior in mechanically robust 3D constructs is demonstrated. Furthermore, the engineered cartilage-like tissue construct is integrated with an electrochemical biosensing system to bring functional olfactory sensations toward multiple specific airway disease biomarkers, explosives, and toxins under biocompatible conditions. Proposed hybrid constructs can lay the groundwork for functional bionic interfaces and humanoid cyborgs.

AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.

AB  - There is concern over transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) between animals and humans. The spread of hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA is a major challenge in human medicine. MRSA is rarely isolated from animals but methicillin resistance occurs in staphylococci that are more prevalent in animals. MRSA infections in animals are uncommon and most are associated with exposure to medical hospitals, extensive wounds, prolonged hospitalisation and immunosuppression. The risk to human health appears to be small but a survey of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in animals is required. Thorough investigation of possible zoonotic infections to establish linkage is encouraged. Medical and veterinary staff should appreciate that animals can carry MRSA, cooperate in eliminating infections and monitor animals in medical environments. Veterinary clinics should implement guidelines for dealing with MRSA. Responsible antibiotic use should minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance but a UK monitoring scheme is desirable.
