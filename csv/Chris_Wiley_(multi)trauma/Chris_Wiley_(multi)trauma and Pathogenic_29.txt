AB  - A seven-year-old male, entire rottweiler was presented to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital with a 24 hour history of blindness, chemosis, exophthalmus, pain on opening the mouth and hypersialism. Bilateral mandibular and zygomatic salivary gland enlargement with concurrent bilateral zygomatic salivary gland sialocoeles were identified. The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified. Treatment consisted of supportive management, corticosteroids and paracentesis of the sialocoeles and resulted in resolution of the salivary gland enlargement and the associated clinical signs. This is an unusual presentation of salivary gland disease in the dog with multiple gland involvement and a spectrum of disease processes occurring at the same time.

AB  - Abstract Regulatory decisions regarding microbiological safety of cosmetics and personal care products are primarily hazard-based, where the presence of a potential pathogen determines decision-making. This contrasts with the Food industry where it is a commonplace to use a risk-based approach for ensuring microbiological safety. A risk-based approach allows consideration of the degree of exposure to assess unacceptable health risks. As there can be a number of advantages in using a risk-based approach to safety, this study explores the Codex Alimentarius (Codex) four-step Microbiological Risk Assessment (MRA) framework frequently used in the Food industry and examines how it can be applied to the safety assessment of personal care products. The hazard identification and hazard characterization steps (one and two) of the Codex MRA framework consider the main microorganisms of concern. These are addressed by reviewing the current industry guidelines for objectionable organisms and analysing reports of contaminated products notified by government agencies over a recent 5-year period, together with examples of reported outbreaks. Data related to estimation of exposure (step three) are discussed, and examples of possible calculations and references are included. The fourth step, performed by the risk assessor (risk characterization), is specific to each assessment and brings together the information from the first three steps to assess the risk. Although there are very few documented uses of the MRA approach for personal care products, this study illustrates that it is a practicable and sound approach for producing products that are safe by design. It can be helpful in the context of designing products and processes going to market and with setting of microbiological specifications. Additionally, it can be applied reactively to facilitate decision-making when contaminated products are released on to the marketplace. Currently, the knowledge available may only allow a qualitative or semi-quantitative rather than fully quantitative risk assessment, but an added benefit is that the disciplined structuring of available knowledge enables clear identification of gaps to target resources and if appropriate, instigate data generation.

AB  - Abstract Failure of endothelial cells to develop new vessels in response to hypoxia is a distinctive feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in the avascular phase. We have previously shown that SSc endothelial cells over-express matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12), which blocks angiogenesis by cleavage of the endothelial urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). In the present study, we have investigated whether over-expression of MMP-12 and of angiostatic factors, or hypo-expression of angiogenic factors by SSc fibroblasts, contributes to impaired angiogenesis in SSc. Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from healthy subjects (N-Fb) and patients with diffuse SSc (SSc-Fb). Angiogenesis of target normal human microvascular endothelial cells (H-MVECs) was assayed by Matrigel invasion, cell proliferation, and capillary morphogenesis. uPAR cleavage and MMP-12 activity were evaluated by western blotting. We show that the over-expression of MMP-12 by SSc-Fb determines uPAR cleavage in H-MVECs. Conditioned medium from SSc-Fb impaired H-MVEC proliferation, invasion, and capillary morphogenesis. Anti-MMP-12 antibodies restored such impairment. Altered expression of angiostatic/angiogenic factors, including transforming growth factor ?1, did not account for SSc-Fb-dependent impairment of angiogenesis. The over-expression of MMP-12 by both SSc-Fb and SSc endothelial cells indicates that MMP-12 over-production may have a critical pathogenic role in SSc-associated vascular alterations.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the anamnesis, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, treatment and outcome of chinchillas diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis. Methods Medical records of 49 chinchillas diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis were retrospectively reviewed. Association between clinical signs and type of bacteria involved was determined by means of univariate logistic regression. Results 61·5% of the isolated bacteria were Gram-negative, and the most common bacterial species was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50%), followed by Staphylococcus species (26·9%). Chinchillas with acute conjunctivitis (1 to 3 days) were much more commonly affected by Gram-negative organisms. The majority of chinchillas that presented with concurrent respiratory signs were diagnosed with P. aeruginosa. Clinical resolution of conjunctivitis was reported in 87·8% chinchillas with a median time to clinical resolution of 17·5?days. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates to potentiated sulphonamides, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin and polymyxin B was 8·3, 36, 62·5, 88·5, 100 and 100%, respectively. Clinical Significance P. aeruginosa is the predominant bacterial species associated with bacterial conjunctivitis in chinchillas. With the exception of duration of clinical signs, information on the anamnesis or physical examination findings cannot aid in distinguishing conjunctivitis caused by P. aeruginosa or other Gram-negative bacteria from the ones caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Gentamicin- or polymyxin B-containing antibiotic formulations are recommended for empirical topical therapy.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Summary Background and Objectives Chronic wounds are colonized by many different bacteria. Patients and Methods We analyzed microbiological swabs from chronic leg ulcers from 2012/2013 and matched the results with those from 2002/2003 and 2007/2008 from the same institution. Results Results from 100 patients from our specialized wound care center were evaluated retrospectively. The etiologies were broadly variable with chronic venous insufficiency being the most common. As the most common bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was found in 53 % of patients; 9 % of patients were positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in 25 % of patients. Different fecal bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were found in 49 % of the patients; 11 % of the swabs were sterile. The detection rate for S. aureus has regressed by 17.1 % over the past decade and in the case of MRSA by 12.5 %. In contrast, colonization with gram-negative bacteria species significantly increased by 11.7 %. This tendency was also seen in 2007/2008, but with a higher count of P. aeruginosa. Conclusion Although S. aureus is still the most frequently detected bacterium in our wound care center, there has been a shift in the bacterial spectrum from gram-positive towards gram-negative bacteria over the last decade.

AB  - Free-living amebae are ubiquitous in our environment, but rarely cause cutaneous infection. Balamuthia mandrillaris has a predilection for infecting skin of the central face. Infection may be restricted to the skin or associated with life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We report a case of a 91-year-old woman, who presented with a non-healing red plaque over her right cheek. Several punch biopsies exhibited non-specific granulomatous inflammation without demonstrable fungi or mycobacteria in histochemical stains. She was treated empirically for granulomatous rosacea, but the lesion continued to progress. A larger incisional biopsy was performed in which amebae were observed in hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. These were retrospectively apparent in the prior punch biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction studies identified the organisms as Balamuthia mandrillaris. Cutaneous infection by B. mandrillaris is a rare condition that is sometimes complicated by life-threatening CNS involvement and which often evades timely diagnosis due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations. Moreover, these amebae are easily overlooked in histopathologic sections because of their small number and their resemblance to histiocytes. Dermatopathologists should be familiar with the histopathologic appearance of these organisms and include balamuthiasis and other amebic infections in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis.

AB  - Abstract Background Early life stress (ELS) has been linked to health disparities across the human lifespan, particularly increased risk for depression and its recurrence. In this study we explore two plausible and competing pathways through which ELS may lead to depression via inflammation. Methods Participants (ages 18?22; n = 41) completed the Early Trauma Inventory as a measure of ELS. Participants then completed consecutive daily diaries of mood and other sickness behavior for the 7 days prior to and 7 days after receiving the annual influenza vaccine. Circulating concentrations of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured immediately before and 24 hr after vaccination. Results ELS was not associated with the magnitude of change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine, however, exposure to ELS moderated the association between change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine and changes in both cognitive difficulty and depressed mood. Individuals exposed to greater ELS showed greater psychological sensitivity to increases in IL-6. Conclusions Exposure to ELS may increase sensitivity to peripheral inflammation in the central nervous system. Future studies elaborating on the impact of ELS on the sensitivity of specific neural circuits and cells to inflammation are needed.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Current labelling for the use of ceftiofur crystalline free acid (CCFA) in horses states that 2 i.m. doses must be administered 4 days apart to provide 10 days of therapeutic coverage. A 10 day treatment regimen is not sufficient for the long-term treatment of horses with severe lung consolidation or pleuropneumonia. There are currently no data to guide an appropriate dosing interval when a longer treatment regimen is warranted. Objectives To determine steady-state plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA) after weekly i.m. administration of CCFA to adult horses. Study design Experimental study. Methods Seven adult horses received i.m. CCFA at a dose of 6.6?mg/kg bwt on Day?0, Day?4 and every 7 days thereafter for 3 additional doses. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF were measured at various time intervals. Results After weekly i.m. administration, the mean (±?s.d.) steady-state peak DCA concentration in plasma (2.87 ± 1.50??g/ml) was significantly higher than that in PELF (0.84 ± 0.53??g/ml). Mean terminal half-lives in plasma (77.5 ± 17.5?h) and PELF (92.8 ± 59.0?h) were not significantly different. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF remained in the therapeutic range for the entire dosing interval. Conclusions After the initial 2-dose regimen 4 days apart, weekly i.m. administration of CCFA was well tolerated and resulted in plasma and PELF DCA concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration that inhibits growth of at least 90% of common lower respiratory tract pathogens of horses. Potential relevance Weekly administration of CCFA would appear appropriate when a treatment regimen longer than 10 days is warranted based on clinical signs and disease severity.

AB  - Abstract Burn injuries and associated complications present a major public health challenge. Many burn patients develop clinically intractable complications, including pain and other sensory disorders. Recent evidence has shown that dendritic spine neuropathology in spinal cord sensory and motor neurons accompanies central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) trauma and disease. However, no research has investigated similar dendritic spine neuropathologies following a cutaneous thermal burn injury. In this retrospective investigation, we analyzed dendritic spine morphology and localization in alpha-motor neurons innervating a burn-injured area of the body (hind paw). To identify a molecular regulator of these dendritic spine changes, we further profiled motor neuron dendritic spines in adult mice treated with romidepsin, a clinically approved Pak1-inhibitor, or vehicle control at two postburn time points: Day 6 immediately after treatment, or Day 10 following drug withdrawal. In control treated mice, we observed an overall increase in dendritic spine density, including structurally mature spines with mushroom-shaped morphology. Pak1-inhibitor treatment reduced injury-induced changes to similar levels observed in animals without burn injury. The effectiveness of the Pak1-inhibitor was durable, since normalized dendritic spine profiles remained as long as 4 days despite drug withdrawal. This study is the first report of evidence demonstrating that a second-degree burn injury significantly affects motor neuron structure within the spinal cord. Furthermore, our results support the opportunity to study dendritic spine dysgenesis as a novel avenue to clarify the complexities of neurological disease following traumatic injury.
