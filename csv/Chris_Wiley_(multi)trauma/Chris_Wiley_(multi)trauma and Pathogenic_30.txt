AB  - OBJECTIVE Red complex bacteria (Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis) play a major role in the aetiology of periodontal disease in humans. This study was designed to evaluate the association of such bacteria with periodontal disease in dogs. METHODS Seventy-three subgingival samples taken from dogs ranging from 2?months to 12?years (median age 4?years) were tested for red complex bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS Thirty-six of 73 (49?·?3%) dogs were found to be positive for T. forsythia and P. gingivalis. Dogs with gingivitis or periodontitis were more likely to be infected with T. forsythia and P. gingivalis [odds ratio (OR) 5?·?4 (confidence interval (CI) 1?·?9-15?·?6), P?=?0?·?002] than healthy animals. Only 3 (4?·?1%) of 73 samples were positive for red complex bacteria, but the association with periodontal disease was not significant. Conclusion And Clinical Relevance The results indicate that involvement of red complex bacteria in periodontal disease in dogs is similar to that observed in humans. Only the concurrent presence of T.?forsythia and P. gingivalis were correlated to periodontal disease in dogs in this study.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - Abstract The number of displaced persons today is the highest since World War II. Flight has become increasingly dangerous and refugees are now in poorer health conditions. Severe traumatization happens in their home-countries but atrocities under flight is increasing, including torture, trafficking and death. It has become increasingly difficult to reach Western countries and those who come now meet difficult conditions with poor living conditions and growing xenophobia. There are unmet treatment needs in the refugee population and lack of early preventive measures. Many severely traumatized will also need qualified psychotherapy. This article presents a psychoanalytic view on traumatization and describes specific features of psychoanalytic therapy with severely traumatized refugees. A case example is presented to illustrate how the analyst inevitably becomes involved in traumatization related mental scenarios and how this involvement may provoke countertransference enactment. It is demonstrated how this may be solved in the therapeutic process and facilitate integration of traumatic experiences and loss.

AB  - ABSTRACT Systems orientated research offers the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets and relevant diagnostic markers for complex diseases such as osteoarthritis. This review demonstrates that the osteoarthritis research community has been slow to incorporate systems orientated approaches into research studies, although a number of key studies reveal novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms that contribute both to joint tissue homeostasis and its dysfunction. The review introduces both top-down and bottom-up approaches employed in the study of osteoarthritis. A holistic and multiscale approach, where clinical measurements may predict dysregulation and progression of joint degeneration, should be a key objective in future research. The review concludes with suggestions for further research and emerging trends not least of which is the coupled development of diagnostic tests and therapeutics as part of a concerted effort by the osteoarthritis research community to meet clinical needs. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Non-surgical removal of plaque and calculus has been part of the initial phase of the management of patients with gingivitis and periodontitis for decades. It consists of patient motivation and oral hygiene instruction as well as mechanical removal of supra and subgingival plaque deposits. The purpose of this review was to assess recent changes. The article reports on changes in our understanding of plaque as a biofilm, developments in patient plaque control, chemical plaque control and scaling instruments. It also comments on full-mouth disinfection, the use of lasers and host modulation. Modern technology has made removal of microbial deposits by the patient and dental professionals more efficient. However, other advancements need to be used in conjunction with mechanical debridement at this time.

AB  - Abstract An Erratum has been published for this article in British Journal of Surgery 90(6) 2003, 764. Background: A direct comparison of open operation and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for radical oesophagectomy has yet to be published. Methods: Medical records of 149 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent oesophagectomy and three-field lymphadenectomy were reviewed. Seventy-seven patients had the thoracic procedure performed via a 5-cm minithoracotomy and four ports (VATS group); the others were operated on by conventional posterolateral thoracotomy (open group). Results: The mean number of retrieved mediastinal nodes, blood loss and morbidity were similar in the VATS and open groups (33·9 versus 32·8 nodes, 284 versus 310 g, and 32 versus 38 per cent respectively). The thoracic procedure took longer in patients having VATS than in the control group (227 versus 186 min; P = 0·031). Vital capacity reduction was less with VATS than in the open group (15 versus 22 per cent; P = 0·016). The 3- and 5-year survival rates were similar: 70 and 55 per cent respectively for VATS compared with 60 and 57 per cent for the open procedure. Conclusion: VATS provides comparable results to open radical oesophagectomy, with less surgical trauma. Copyright ? 2003 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Abstract Antenatal milk expression (AME) involves maternal hand-expression, collection, and storage of breast milk during pregnancy for the purposes of reducing the early formula use in breastfed infants. AME is not widely practiced in the United States, despite its growing popularity elsewhere. In this study, we examined the experiences of first-time mothers recruited from a U.S. midwife practice who engaged in AME within the context of a pilot randomized controlled trial. The AME intervention involved demonstration and practice of AME with a lactation consultant beginning at 37 weeks of gestation, reinforcement at weekly study visits until delivery, and daily home practice. Nineteen women participated in a semistructured interview at 1?2 weeks postpartum regarding their study experiences. Major themes included (1) perceived benefits and impact of AME, (b) AME implementation, and (c) use of AME milk. Women perceived multiple benefits of AME, most notably that it increased their confidence that they would be able to make milk and breastfeed successfully postpartum. Women expressed some concern that no/little milk expressed could be indicative of postpartum milk production problems. Regarding implementation, women found that the AME protocol fit well into their daily routine. There was mixed feedback regarding comfort with practicing AME in the presence of partners. Reasons for postpartum use of AME milk varied; barriers to provision included inadequate milk storage options at the birth hospital and unsupportive hospital providers/staff. With few caveats, AME appears to be an acceptable breastfeeding support intervention among a sociodemographically homogeneous group of first-time mothers in the United States.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Vocal cord granulomas are rarely observed in brachycephalic breeds but often reported in humans as contact granulomas. Six French bulldogs were included in this retrospective descriptive study. Endoscopic laryngeal examinations were performed on all dogs under general anaesthesia. Vocal cord lesions were exclusively unilateral, exophytic, approximately 3-mm wide ulcerated mucosal nodules, arising from the vocal cord. Histopathological examination mainly revealed chronic inflammatory changes on the laryngeal epithelium which were consistent with laryngeal granulomas described in humans, except for the location: vocal cord in dogs versus vocal process in humans. In humans, granulomas result from chronic physical or chemical insult to laryngeal mucosa (chronic cough or throat clearing, vocal abuse, gastro-esophageal reflux). In brachycephalic breeds, chronic inspiratory efforts and air turbulences and gastro-esophageal reflux are suspected to result in chronic laryngeal inflammation.

AB  - Abstract IRD organs are classified by the Public Health Service to be at above-average risk for harboring human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B. Traditionally underutilized, there exists even greater reluctance for their use in pediatric patients. We performed a retrospective analysis via the United Network for Organ Sharing database of all pediatric renal and hepatic transplants performed from 2004 to 2008 in the United States. Primary outcomes were patient and graft survival. Proportional hazards regression was performed to control for potentially confounding factors. Waitlist time, organ acceptance rates, and infectious transmissions were analyzed. There were 1830 SRD renal, 92 IRD renal, 1695 SRD hepatic, and 59 IRD hepatic transplants. There were no statistically significant differences in allograft or patient survival in either group. Acceptance rates of IRD organs were lower for kidney (1.5% IRD vs 4.82% SRD) and liver (1.99% IRD vs 4.51% SRD). One transmission of a bloodborne pathogen involving a pediatric recipient out of 7797 unique transplants was reported from 2008 to 2015. IRD organs appear to have equivalent outcomes. Increasing their utilization may improve access to transplant while decreasing wait times and circumventing waitlist morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Objectives The potential influence of infections and immunological changes on the aetiology and pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD) has been discussed. Our aim was to detect intrathecal specific antibody synthesis against the neurotropic infectious agents that have previously been linked to BD. Methods Paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 40 patients with BD were analysed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the concentration of antibodies against the following neurotropic infectious pathogens: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein?Barr virus (EBV). The specific antibody index (AI) was calculated, and an AI > 1.4 was considered to be evidence of intrathecal specific antibody synthesis. Twenty-six patients with pseudotumour cerebri served as controls. Results Eight out of 40 patients with BD displayed specific intrathecal antibody synthesis against at least one of the tested neurotropic agents compared to only one patient in the control group (p = 0.061, not significant). Of these eight patients with BD, no significant prevalence of any particular neurotropic pathogen was evident. Five out of 40 patients with BD showed oligoclonal bands in the CSF, suggestive of a chronic immune reaction in the central nervous system (CNS). Conclusions We found evidence for increased production of antibody in the CSF of individuals with BD. However, the trend for polyspecific intrathecal antibody synthesis, as well as the presence of oligoclonal bands, might indicate activation of the intrathecal humoral immune system in a subgroup of patients with BD, as it is known to be associated with autoimmune disorders of the CNS.

AB  - Abstract The complement cascade has long been recognized to play a key role in inflammatory and degenerative diseases. It is a ?double edged? sword as it is necessary to maintain health, yet can have adverse effects when unregulated, often exacerbating disease. The contrasting effects of complement, depending on whether in a setting of health or disease, is the price paid to achieve flexibility in scope and degree of a protective response for the host from infection and injury. Loss or even decreased efficiency of critical regulatory control mechanisms can result in aggravated inflammation and destruction of self-tissue. The role of the complement cascade is poorly understood in the nervous system and neurological disorders. Novel studies have demonstrated that the expression of complement proteins in brain varies in different cell types and the effects of complement activation in various disease settings appear to differ. Understanding the functioning of this cascade is essential, as it has therapeutic implications. In this review, we will attempt to provide insight into how this complex cascade functions and to identify potential strategic targets for therapeutic intervention in chronic diseases as well as acute injury in the CNS.
