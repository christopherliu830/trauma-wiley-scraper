AB  - Opioid systems mainly regulate physiological functions such as pain, emotional tone and reward circuitry in neural tissues (brain and spinal cord). These systems are also found in extraneural tissues (ganglia, gut, spleen, stomach, lung, pancreas, liver, heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent studies have elucidated their roles in various organs. The current review focuses on the roles of opioid systems in blood vessels, especially angiogenesis, during development and tumour malignancy. The balance between endogenous activators and inhibitors of angiogenesis delicately maintains a normally quiescent vasculature to sustain homeostasis. Disturbance of this balance causes pathogenic angiogenesis and, especially in tumours, several activators such as VEGF are highly expressed in the tumour microenvironment and strongly induce tumour angiogenesis, the so-called angiogenic switch. Recently, we demonstrated that ? opioid receptor agonists function as anti-angiogenic factors, which impede the angiogenic switch, in vascular development and tumour angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of receptors for VEGF. In clinical medicine, angiogenesis inhibitors that target VEGF signalling such as bevacizumab are used as anti-cancer drugs. Although therapies that inhibit tumour angiogenesis have been highly successful for tumour therapy, most patients eventually develop resistance to this anti-angiogenic therapy. Thus, we must identify novel targets for anti-angiogenic agents to sustain inhibition of angiogenesis for tumour therapy. The regulation of responses to ? opioid receptor ligands could be useful for controlling vascular formation under physiological conditions and in cancers, and thus could offer therapeutic benefits beyond the relief of pain.

AB  - Infliximab is a chimeric antitumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody used to treat Crohn?s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute infusion reactions, headache, fever, chills, urticaria and chest pain were seen in 17% of patients with infliximab compared with 7% of those receiving placebo. Other adverse cutaneous reactions are fungal dermatitis, eczema, seborrhoea, hordeolum, bullous eruption, furunculosis, periorbital oedema, hyperkeratosis, rosacea, verruca, skin pigmentation, alopecia, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichenoid drug eruption, erythema multiforme, perniosis-like eruption, granuloma annulare and acute folliculitis. Any pathogenic mechanism has been suggested. Patch test with infliximab can induce flare-up of lesions, nausea and malaise and suggest a percutaneous absortion. A sixty years-old man with atopy background and rheumatoid arthritis treated with Remicare?, infliximab who developed a severe acute urticaria with angioedema is presented. The lesions appearance after previous endovenous administrations and the worsening spreading wheals days after the injection clinically suggested an hypersensitivity mechanism. The protocolized study drug hypersensitivity performed showed only the Prick Test positivity with infliximab at 30/60 minutes. Patch test with infliximab was negative and any adverse event was reported. Actually the patient is treated with etanercept and this drug is well tolerated. This result suggested a type I hypersensitivity mediated reaction. Urticaria could be induced as immunologic reaction of the host against the murine part of infliximab, just as it hapens with other antichimeric antibodies.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Health, disease, and immune function are key areas of research in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited by a lack of direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. Materials and Methods We took advantage of veterinary checks on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. Results We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. Discussion We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of immune function, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.

AB  - Abstract Liver cell death induced by stresses such as ischemia-reperfusion, cholestasis and drug toxicity can trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). A similar inflammatory response can be induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as endotoxin. Both DAMPs and PAMPs activate through toll-like receptors the resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver. Central to this inflammatory response is promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by these phagocytes. ROS are the principal toxic mediators by which inflammatory cells kill their targets, e.g. bacteria during host defense but also hepatocytes and other liver cells. The mechanism of ROS-induced cell killing during inflammation involves the promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to oncotic necrosis and less apoptosis. The additional release of cell contents amplifies the inflammatory injury. However, an inflammatory oxidant stress insufficient to directly cause cell damage can induce transcription of stress defence genes including antioxidant genes. This preconditioning effect of ROS enhances the resistance against future inflammatory oxidant stress and promotes the initiation of tissue repair processes. Despite the substantial progress in our understanding of mechanisms of inflammatory liver injury during the last decade, more research is necessary to better understand the role of ROS in acute liver inflammation and to develop clinically applicable therapeutic strategies that selectively target the detrimental effects of oxidant stress without compromising the vital function of ROS in host defense.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a leading cause of vision loss in horses. Objectives To assess the prognosis and impact of ERU on affected horses and their owners by evaluating the signalment, treatment and outcome (including the loss of use, vision assessment and economic loss). Study design Retrospective impact study. Methods Medical records of horses presenting to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Health Complex (NCSU-VHC) with ERU between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Signalment, clinical signs, ophthalmic examination findings, treatments and outcomes were evaluated. Owner questionnaires were completed regarding vision, job/role, monetary value, diagnostic and treatment costs, concurrent illness and outcomes. Results Records of 224 horses (338 eyes) with ERU were reviewed. There was an overrepresentation of Appaloosas (54; 24.1%), Hanoverians (11; 4.9%) and other Warmbloods (13; 5.8%). Ninety-six eyes (28.4%) were diagnosed as blind and 38 eyes (11.2%) with glaucoma on initial evaluation. Leptospirosis titres of serum and/or aqueous humour were obtained in 88 horses and were positive in 40 horses (45.5%), with L. pomona being the most frequently isolated serovar. Globe loss at the NCSU-VHC occurred in 41 ERU eyes (12.1% of total). Owner questionnaires were evaluated in 194 horses (86.6%) and 91 horses (46.9%) were reported blind in the affected eye(s). Fifty-seven horses (29.4%) did not return to their previous role, while 61 (31.4%) performed at a reduced level. Equine recurrent uveitis decreased the monetary value of 164 horses. Twenty-nine horses (14.9%) were euthanised and 37 (19.1%) underwent change in ownership as a direct result of ERU. Conclusions The impact of ERU is attributed to the high frequency of blindness, globe loss and loss of function. Euthanasia and change of ownership are common sequelae to the progressive nature of ERU. These factors, along with financial costs of the disease, have a significant impact on affected horses and their owners. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Abstract T cell adaptation is an important peripheral tolerogenic process which ensures that the T cell population can respond effectively to pathogens but remains tolerant to self-antigens. We probed the mechanisms of T cell adaptation using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in which the fate of autopathogenic T cells could be followed. We demonstrated that immunisation with a high dose of myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant failed to effectively initiate EAE, in contrast to low dose MBP peptide immunisation which readily induced disease. The proportion of autopathogenic CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice immunised with a high dose of MBP peptide was not significantly different to mice immunised with a low dose. However, autopathogenic T cells in mice immunised with high dose MBP peptide had an unresponsive phenotype in ex vivo recall assays. Importantly, whilst expression of PD-1 was increased on adapted CD4+ T cells within the CNS, loss of PD-1 function did not prevent the development of the unresponsive state. The lack of a role for PD-1 in the acquisition of the adapted state stands in striking contrast to the reported functional importance of PD-1 in T cell unresponsiveness in other disease models.

AB  - Abstract Translocation of wildlife as a means of reintroducing or reinforcing threatened populations is an important conservation tool but carries health risks for the translocated animals and their progeny, as well as wildlife, domestic animals and humans in the release area. Disease risk analyses (DRA) are used to identify, prioritize and design mitigation strategies to address these threats. Here, we use a DRA undertaken for Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) to illustrate how specific methodology can optimize mitigation strategy design. A literature review identified a total of 98 infectious hazards and 28 non-infectious hazards. Separate analyses were undertaken for disease risks in leopards from hazards of source origin (captive zoo collections and the transit pathway to the Russian Far East), or of destination origin (in breeding enclosures and wider release areas); and for disease risks in other wildlife, domesticated species or humans, similarly from hazards of source or destination origin. Hazards were assessed and ranked as priority 1, priority 2, priority 3 or low priority in each of the defined scenarios. In addition, we undertook a generic assessment of stress on individual leopards. We use three examples to illustrate the process: Chlamydophila felis, canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). We found that many potentially expensive screening procedures could be performed prior to export of leopards, putting the onus of responsibility onto the zoo sector, for which access to diagnostic testing facilities is likely to be optimal. We discuss how our methods highlighted significant data gaps relating to pathogen prevalence in the Russian Far East and likely future unpredictability, in particular with respect to CDV. There was emphasis at all stages on record keeping, meticulous planning, design, staff training and enclosure management, which are relatively financially inexpensive. Actions to minimize stress featured at all time points in the strategy and also focussed on planning, design and management.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious problem that adversely affects human health, limits longevity and increases costs to health-care systems worldwide. Its increasing incidence cannot be fully explained by traditional risk factors. Oxidative stress is prevalent in CKD patients and is considered to be an important pathogenic mechanism. Oxidative stress develops from an imbalance between free radical production often increased through dysfunctional mitochondria formed with increasing age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammation, and reduced anti-oxidant defences. Perturbations in cellular oxidant handling influence downstream cellular signalling and, in the kidney, promote renal cell apoptosis and senescence, decreased regenerative ability of cells, and fibrosis. These factors have a stochastic deleterious effect on kidney function. The majority of studies investigating anti-oxidant treatments in CKD patients show a reduction in oxidative stress and many show improved renal function. Despite heterogeneity in the oxidative stress levels in the CKD population, there has been little effort to measure patient oxidative stress levels before the use of any anti-oxidants therapies to optimize outcome. This review describes the development of oxidative stress, how it can be measured, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and the molecular pathways that are altered, the role of oxidative stress in CKD pathogenesis and an update on the amelioration of CKD using anti-oxidant therapies.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of the present study was to describe the factors associated with delays in the delivery of appropriate antibiotics to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the ED or wards with septic shock. Methods All adult patients admitted to the ICU, at a single centre who had presented via the ED within the previous 48?h and who had septic shock were included. Data regarding the cause of sepsis, timing of administration of antibiotics, the appropriateness of antibiotics, results of cultures and features potentially related to delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotics were collected by a single investigator, onto specifically designed data forms. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were undertaken to determine the timing of appropriate antibiotics administration. Results Eighty-nine patients who developed septic shock within 48?h of hospital presentation were admitted to the ICU at Royal North Shore between 2005 and 2008. The median time to administration of antibiotics was 120?min (interquartile range [IQR], 40?225) and the median time to administration of appropriate antibiotics was 188?min (IQR, 65?440?min). Patients who did not have sepsis as their initial diagnosis (90 vs 268?min; P < 0.002), those who waited until investigations were performed (88 vs 320?min; P < 0.001) and younger patients (? = ?5.6; P = 0.04) had longer time delays to receive antibiotic therapy. Patients who were assessed by an emergency physician after developing septic shock were given antibiotics that were appropriate in a median of 20?min (IQR, 10?160?min), those assessed initially by a resident medical officer after developing septic shock in a median of 180?min (IQR, 78?563?min). Conclusions This retrospective cohort study found that there were significant delays associated with the administration of appropriate antibiotics in patients admitted to the ICU from the ED or the wards with septic shock. Delays were greater in patients who were not seen by an emergency physician, those in whom the diagnosis of sepsis was not considered initially and in those whose therapy was delayed while awaiting the performance of investigations.

AB  - Abstract Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a fulminant necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia. Few reports of FG exist in patients with hematologic malignancies. We describe a case of fatal FG in a 21-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who was receiving remission-induction chemotherapy. Despite early local surgery, administration of appropriate antibiotics, resurgery for wider debridement and aggressive ICU support he succumbed while pancytopenic to septic shock, 26 days after initiation of chemotherapy. Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from blood and scrotal cultures obtained at initial surgery. FG is a fulminant infection, especially in the face of profound cytopenias.

AB  - Summary Intellectual disability (ID) is a global and persistent reduction in cognitive abilities beginning early in development and associated with impairment in daily functioning including communication, social skills, personal independence and school/work functioning. Classification systems distinguish levels of severity based on measured intellectual quotient (IQ) and degree of impairment in adaptive functioning. Prevalence estimates for ID vary widely but aggregate around 2-3% in high income countries, with mild ID about five times more common than severe forms. The multiple factors associated with ID are discussed including chromosomal disorders, genetic abnormalities, psychosocial adversity, exposure to prenatal infections and alcohol, postnatal exposure to environmental toxins and severe early deprivation. ID is associated with a three- to five-fold increased risk for all psychiatric disorders and about 15% of children with psychiatric disorders have ID. In childhood, ID is most strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Milder ID is often under-recognized and clinicians should be alert to warning signs, including poor academic attainments, school non-attendance and family history of learning and educational problems. When diagnosing psychiatric disorder in people with ID, considerations include the appropriateness of the behaviour in relation to developmental (rather than chronological) age and the multiple possible underlying causes for ?behaviour that challenges? should be carefully assessed so that targeted interventions can be used. In general, there are at present no effective treatments for the core cognitive deficits of ID. Interventions focus on appropriate education and support for affected individuals and their families that maximize quality of life and community participation. Treatment planning should be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency. The limited evidence base for treating psychiatric disorders in ID supports the use of similar interventions, although effect sizes may be diminished. Pharmacotherapy should involve lower starting doses, more gradual increases and careful monitoring, as people with ID are more sensitive to adverse effects. Psychological interventions should utilize behavioural strategies, supported with visual materials and the involvement of parents, carers and other professionals such as teachers. Family-wide support and respite care from voluntary groups and social services may be invaluable.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the potential utility of cytokine and arachidonic acid metabolite levels in ED patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a predictor of progression to severe sepsis. Methods: A prospective, observational study of test performance was performed using convenience samples of adult control subjects and admitted patients. The latter patients were identified in the ED as having signs of SIRS. Levels of cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites measured from specimens obtained in the ED were compared between groups and associated with the progression of sepsis within 24 hours in the SIRS patients. Results: There were 30 control patients and 29 SIRS patients. There were 8 SIRS subjects who progressed to severe sepsis within 24 hours using the following criteria (hypotension, n = 5; hypoperfusion, n = 1; and organ dysfunction, n = 2). Of the 21 SIRS subjects who did not progress to severe sepsis, 11 had resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours. There were no significant differences in mean mediator levels between the SIRS patients who progressed to severe sepsis and those who did not. Of the 11 patients with resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours, the mean interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly lower than that for the patients who did not recover or who progressed at 24 hours (n = 18); 65.4 ± 49.1 vs 230 ±112 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Six of 15 subjects with IL-6 >150 pg/mL progressed to severe sepsis (p = NS). Using threshold values based on the range of levels for normals, the sensitivity of an abnormal marker for the development of severe sepsis within 24 hours varied from 50% to 87%, while the specificity varied from 11% to 84%. Conclusion: While mean levels were significantly elevated when compared with those of normal control subjects, they had limited ability to predict the subset of patients likely to progress to severe sepsis. However, initial low levels of cytokines may have exclusionary prognostic value. Prospective validation of the latter finding is warranted.

AB  - Summary The genus Staphylococcus includes spherical or slightly oval cocci with a diameter of around 0.5-1.5??m. Genus Staphylococcus is a broad group of microorganisms, among which 47 species and 24 subspecies have been described. The basic division of these bacteria distinguishes two groups: coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). This division results from the ability of S. aureus to clot plasma observed many years ago and the lack of this property in other species known at the time. A consistent increase in the role of coagulase-negative staphylococci in causing hospital infections has been observed in recent years. The membrane ABC proteins are responsible for the active removal of an antibiotic from the staphylococcal cells. From a food safety point of view, the presence of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci should be considered on a number of levels.
