AB  - Summary Background Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is a rare cause of lameness in the adult horse, and a haematogenous pathogenesis has been proposed in previous cases. Objectives To describe the features and outcome of synovial sepsis of unknown origin in adult Thoroughbred racehorses. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Hospital records for admissions between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed to identify adult horses diagnosed with synovial sepsis of unknown origin. Presentation, clinicopathological, microbiological and diagnostic imaging findings were recorded. Treatment methods, surgical findings, complications and long-term outcome were evaluated. Results Eleven cases were identified over the study period. Diagnosis was established from clinical examination and clinicopathologic findings, which were comparable to other aetiologies of synovial sepsis. Affected structures included synovial joints, tendon sheaths and bursae. Concurrent osteochondritis dissecans or articular cartilage lesions were evident during arthroscopic surgery in three cases. Significant intrasynovial haemorrhage was not identified. Microbial culture of synovial fluid or synovial biopsy was positive in 6/11 of cases, with all isolates being Gram-positive cocci. Of the 6 positive microbial cultures, all isolates demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to a cephalosporin antimicrobial agent. A concurrent remote wound was present in a single case. No other potential origins of bacteraemia were identified. Treatment methods included endoscopic surgery, standing multineedle lavage, intravenous regional limb perfusion, intrasynovial medication and/or systemic antimicrobial administration. All horses survived to hospital discharge. For the 6/11 cases that raced following synovial sepsis, the median period for return to racing was 221 days. Main limitations A small study population, which was retrospectively reviewed. Conclusions Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is rare in the adult Thoroughbred racehorse and can affect a range of synovial structures. A concurrent potential source of bacteraemia is rarely identified. With appropriate management, the prognosis to return to racing is fair.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in normal mammalian brain function, the concept of excitotoxic neuronal death as an important final common path in a variety of diseases, and modification of excitatory synaptic transmission as an important new pharmacological principle. These principles are discussed, with special emphasis on diseases of importance to older adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to May 1995 was undertaken, as well as a manual search of current issues of clinical and basic neuroscience journals, for articles that addressed glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate and/or excitotoxicity. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 5398 original and 68 review articles were identified that addressed animal and human experimentation relevant to excitotoxic neuronal death. There were 364 articles with potential significance for clinical application identified; 132 of the most recent references are provided. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were classified into three categories: general receptor, biology pathogenesis of disease, and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Glutamic and aspartic acids are the physiological mediators of most excitatory synaptic transmission. This is critical to several normal nervous system functions, including memory and long-term modification of synaptic transmission and nociception. Activation of the inotropic NMDA and non-NMDA receptors increases transmembrane calcium and sodium fluxes, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor activation results in generation of inositol triphosphate and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Numerous modulatory sites exist, especially on the NMDA receptor. Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, superoxide, and intracellular calcium overload are the ultimate mediators of neuronal death. Glutamate re-uptake transporters belong to a unique family of amino acid transport systems, the malfunction of which is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis. Ischemic stroke, hypoglycemia, Parkinson's disease, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes are only some of the important clinical neurological disorders with a major pathogenic role for the excitatory amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory amino acid receptors is likely to be of benefit in important and common diseases of the nervous system. Only a few of the currently available drugs that modify excitatory neurotransmission, such as remacemide, lamotrigine, and tizanidine, have an acceptable therapeutic index. The identification of numerous receptor subtypes, topographic variabilities of distribution, and multiple modulatory sites will provide a true challenge to the neuropharmacologist.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - Objectives Defects in copper metabolism have been described in several dog breeds, and recently, it has been suggested that changes in other essential trace elements could be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic disease. This study measured hepatic copper accumulation and its interactions with other essential trace and toxic metals in dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis. Methods Liver samples of 20 chronic hepatitis and 20 healthy dogs were collected. Samples were acid digested, and essential metals (cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molibdenum, selenium and zinc) and toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead) were analysed by inductively?coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results Copper concentrations were significantly higher in dogs affected by hepatic disease than in controls. Dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentration greater than 100 mg/kg wet weight showed statistically higher cobalt, manganese and zinc concentrations than dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentrations less than 100 mg/kg wet weight and controls. Toxic metal concentrations were low ? in all cases below the threshold associated with toxicity in dogs. Clinical Significance Dogs with chronic hepatitis not only have increased concentrations of copper in the liver but also increased concentrations of cobalt, manganese and zinc; measurement of these elements may perhaps aid in diagnosis of liver disease in dogs.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

AB  - ABSTRACT Amyloids are primarily known for their roles in neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in systemic diseases like diabetes. Evolutionary forces tend to maintain a healthy set of heritable characteristics, while eliminating toxic or unfavourable elements; but amyloids seem to represent an exception to this fundamental concept. In addition to their presence in mammals, amyloids also persist in the proteome of many lower organisms that may be linked with possible roles in survival, which are still unexplored. Herein, we address some unanswered questions regarding amyloids: are these well-structured proteinaceous aggregates a by-product of inefficient folding events, or have they been retained in our protein repertoire for as yet unknown functional roles; and how do protein misfolding and associated disorders originate, despite the presence of protein quality-control systems inside the cells? This review aims to extend our current understanding about the multifaceted useful properties of amyloids and their functional interactions with other molecular pathways in various species; this may provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Summary Over the years, the role of biochemical, immunological, genetic, and other biological aspects in the pathogenesis of vitiligo has been studied. So far, no convincing model describing the interplay of these contributing factors has been formulated. Based on existing research, we propose that vitiligo has a multi-factorial etiology, characterized by multiple steps, but always involving an increase of external or internal phenol/catechol concentration, serving as a preferred surrogate substrate of tyrosinase, competing with its physiological substrate tyrosine. The conversion of these substrates into reactive quinones is reinforced by a disturbed redox balance (increasing hydrogen peroxide). Such reactive quinones can be covalently bound to the catalytic centre of tyrosinase (haptenation). This could give rise to a new antigen, carried by Langerhans cells to the regional lymph node, stimulating the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. However, the activation of such cytotoxic cells is only a first step in skin melanocyte killing, which also depends on a shift in the balance between immune defence and tolerance, e.g. resulting from a decrease in properly functioning T-regulatory cells. With this new model, based on a synthesis of several of the existing theories, in mind, the external and internal factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of vitiligo are reviewed, against the background of reported clinical data, experimental studies and existing and potential new therapies. A similar complex mechanism may also lead to some other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT The relevant considerations which affect the rational use of antibiotics are discussed and the following guide-lines are recommended: (1) Use antibiotics only when there is a strong likelihood of a bacterial infection. (2) Start treatment as early as possible, having taken a specimen for bacteriological investigation, when appropriate. (3) Use as narrow a spectrum antibiotic as possible in order to conserve the normal ecology. (4) Avoid prophylactic antibiotics except in certain well-defined circumstances. (5) Give the correct dose of antibiotic for the correct length of time to ensure proper tissue levels. Bear in mind that in young animals pharmacokinetics may often differ from those in adult animals. Stress the proper time intervals at which the drug should be given. Ensure that the drug is actually taken. Bear in mind that not all drugs mix well with each other. (6) Take steps to minimize cross-infection. (7) Adopt an antibiotic policy, whereby by restriction, rotation or diversification of antibiotic use, many of the problems involved in the emergence of resistant organisms described above may be to some extent avoided. This action only applies to hospitals or specific parts of hospitals (e. g. intensive care units). sity of Lourenco Marques, Lourenco Marques, Mozambique.

AB  - BACKGROUND Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) culls pathogenic T lymphocytes, be these the clones of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or mediators of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT-GVHD). Whether or not ECP may have an effect in the rarer instances of solid organ transplantation?associated GVHD (SOT-GVHD) is unclear. Mortality rates in SOT-GVHD rival those of transfusion-associated GVHD, with fatalities preceded by pancytopenia and peripheral blood chimerism (PBC) levels exceeding 20%. ECP has been described in two SOT-GVHD cases to date, with one surviving. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Clinicolaboratory features (including HLA relationships) in a case of multivisceral transplantation were reviewed from the time of surgery to the onset and progression of SOT-GVHD. ECP, which was introduced as a less immunosuppressive and more selective intervention, was assessed for its effect on serial PBC (as measured by short-tandem-repeat analysis) and clinical outcome. RESULTS Multivisceral SOT-GVHD manifested with erythroderma, neutropenic sepsis, and PBC increasing from 6% on Posttransplant Day (PTD) 38 to 78% by PTD 60 (at a doubling time of 6 days despite corticosteroids). ECP was administered on PTDs 62 and 67 and was associated with the first evidence of PBC decay to 67% on PTD 69. Death nevertheless ensued on the last day of salvage antithymocyte globulin (PTDs 69-73) despite further PBC reduction to 41%. CONCLUSION Further study is needed to determine if the sooner or more frequent application of ECP might attenuate the high case fatality rates of SOT-GVHD.

AB  - Abstract Numerous studies of animal models have demonstrated the importance of glutamate receptor activation/excitotoxicity in the death of neurons in severe epileptic seizures, as well as the death of many neurons in focal ischemic stroke and global cerebral ischemia. A major theme of this chapter is that there is an excitotoxic component to the degeneration of neurons that occurs in a range of acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. The clinical manifestations of such excitotoxic damage are exactly those that define the disorder, be it stroke, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Dietary energy restriction and a ketogenic diet can be effective treatments for seizures, and energy restriction is neuroprotective in animal models of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, ischemic stroke, AD, PD, and HD. A major goal of future research on excitotoxicity should be to understand how neurons can be protected without compromising their functionality.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses asepsis and infection controls in surgical practice. Proper preparation of the surgical patient is a critical step in the surgical case and is related to the outcome and subsequent potential infection of the surgical site. Improper patient preparation can have catastrophic consequences for the surgical procedure and incision integrity. Surgical prep of veterinary patients consists of two steps: clipping (removal) of the hair/fur and skin cleansing with an antiseptic. Once the patient has received the initial prep, they are ready to be transported to the operating room. Proper positioning of the patient is a critical step in the patient prep process. Surgeons require the patient be positioned in a straight and anatomically correct fashion. Efficient use of specialize veterinary surgical instrumentation requires those using it to understand proper application, handling, care, and troubleshooting. Surgical grade instruments are generally made from stainless steel and other metal alloys such as carbon and chromium.

AB  - Abstract Peri-implantitis is an infection of the tissue around an implant, resulting in the loss of supporting bone. Risk factors for peri-implantitis consist of a history of periodontitis, dental plaque, poor oral hygiene, smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes. A clinical diagnosis indicates inflammatory signs including bleeding on probing with or without suppuration and a peri-implant pocket depth ≥5?mm. A radiograph shows images of marginal bone loss ≥2?mm. A differential diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, occlusal overload, retrograde peri-implantitis and inflammatory implant periapical lesions suggests the appropriate treatment in each case. The non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, including a mechanical treatment alone or combined with antiseptics or antibiotics can improve clinical parameters in the short term but residual defects may still persist. Surgical treatment such as guided bone regeneration results in a gain of clinical attachment level and bone reconstruction in the long term. The limited effect of laser-assisted therapy needs to be further evaluated. The concept of prevention based on early detection and regular maintenance plays a principal role in reducing the occurrence of peri-implantitis.

AB  - Summary Background? Formation of colonic diverticula, via herniation of the colonic wall, is responsible for the development of diverticulosis and consequently diverticular disease. Diverticular disease can be associated with numerous debilitating abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms (including pain, bloating, nausea, constipation and diarrhoea). Aims? To review the state of treatment for diverticular disease and its complications, and briefly discuss potential future therapies. Methods? PubMed and recent conference abstracts were searched for articles describing the treatment of diverticular disease. Results? Many physicians will recommend alterations to lifestyle and increasing fibre consumption. Empirical antibiotics remain the mainstay of therapy for patients with diverticular disease and rifaximin seems to be the best choice. In severe or relapsing disease, surgical intervention is often the only remaining treatment option. Although novel treatment options are yet to become available, the addition of therapies based on mesalazine (mesalamine) and probiotics may enhance treatment efficacy. Conclusions? Data suggest that diverticular disease may share many of the hallmarks of other, better-characterized inflammatory bowel diseases; however, treatment options for patients with diverticular disease are scarce, revolving around antibiotic treatment and surgery. There is a need for a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of diverticular disease to design treatment regimens accordingly.
