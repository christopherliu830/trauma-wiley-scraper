AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - Abstract The conventional methods of treatment of pressure ulcers (PUs) by serial debridement and daily dressings require prolonged hospitalisation, associated with considerable morbidity. There is, however, recent evidence to suggest that negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) accelerates healing. The commercial devices for NPWT are costly, cumbersome, and electricity dependent. We compared PU wound healing in traumatic paraplegia patients by conventional dressing and by an innovative negative pressure device (NPD). In this prospective, non-randomised trial, 48 traumatic paraplegia patients with PUs of stages 3 and 4 were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n?=?24) received NPWT with our NPD, and group B (n?=?24) received conventional methods of dressing. All patients were followed up for 9?weeks. At week 9, all patients on NPD showed a statistically significant improvement in PU healing in terms of slough clearance, granulation tissue formation, wound discharge and culture. A significant reduction in wound size and ulcer depth was observed in NPD as compared with conventional methods at all follow-up time points (P?=?0·0001). NPWT by the innovative device heals PUs at a significantly higher rate than conventional treatment. The device is safe, easy to apply and cost-effective.

AB  - Removing, inactivating or detecting pathogens in platelet units are panaceas that some expect to revolutionize transfusion support for patients. Opting for transfusion without concern for the presence of pathogens may not be such a simple decision, however. The effect of pathogen reduction treatment may reduce platelet number and/or function. Clinical trials have documented that treated platelets provide effective hemostatic support for thrombocytopenic patients. However, platelets may need to be transfused in greater quantity, and thus the treatment technique may create a greater demand for the production of platelets through the supply system. Toxicologic concerns about the treatments must be addressed to ensure that there is net benefit for patients. Testing reported to date suggests that any residual compounds are at concentrations far below that associated with detectable toxicity, but the concept of transfusing a component containing even minute amounts of toxic substances may be unsettling to some. Detecting bacteria may remove the largest remaining infectious threat in platelet units and would leave platelets undamaged to function normally. This opens the option for extending the storage period of platelet units, but any extension of storage would be expected to be associated with a decrease in recovery and survival. To avoid continuing decrements with each proposed change in processing or storage, a new standard for efficacy has been proposed that would compare the recovery and survival of the platelet component to fresh platelets from the same donor. This standard appears useful and applicable in ensuring safe and efficacious platelets for transfusion. The question remains: Which direction is best for platelet recipients?

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?CONTRACTING A DISEASE from bloodborne pathogens has been identified as an occupational hazard for perioperative personnel for more than two decades. Perioperative staff members are particularly vulnerable to percutaneous exposure. ?DESPITE KNOWN HAZARDS, research has shown that perioperative staff members continue to take risks by not consistently complying with standard precautions and not reporting all percutaneous injuries. ?HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCWs) and their employers need to work together to ensure that workplaces are safe. This article discusses mechanisms of bloodborne pathogen transmission, compliance with standard guidelines, and the social and economic costs of contracting a bloodborne illness. Steps to ensure that HCWs are protected also are outlined.

AB  - Summary Background? MMX? mesalazine [LIALDA? (US), MEZAVANT? XL (UK and Ireland) MEZAVANT? (elsewhere)] utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System? (MMX) technology which delivers mesalazine throughout the colon. Two phase III studies have already evaluated MMX mesalazine in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Aim  To provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of MMX mesalazine over placebo by combining the patient populations from the two phase III studies. Methods? Combined data from two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Patients randomized to MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day (once daily or 1.2?g twice daily), 4.8?g/day (once daily) or placebo were reviewed. The primary end point was clinical and endoscopic remission (modified Ulcerative Colitis-Disease Activity Index of ≤1 calculated as: rectal bleeding and stool frequency scores of 0, a combined Physician?s Global Assessment and sigmoidoscopy score of ≤1, no mucosal friability and a ≥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from week 0). Results? Data from 517 patients were analysed. 8-week remission rates were 37.2% and 35.1% in the MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day and 4.8?g/day groups, vs. 17.5% on placebo (P?<?0.001, both comparisons). 8-week complete mucosal healing rates were 32% in both MMX mesalazine groups compared with 16% on placebo. Adverse event frequency was similar in all groups. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine is effective and generally well tolerated for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed at exploring changes in YAP expression and their effect on periodontitis (PD) combined with traumatic occlusion (TO). Materials and Methods BALB/cJ mice were used to establish a PD model by local administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, ATCC 33277) and a TO model by occlusal elevation (OE) using composite resin bonding on the bilateral maxillary molar. The mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) were subjected to cyclic tensile/compressive stress and inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli) to verify in vivo results. Results Severe bone resorption was observed by microCT scanning in OE with P.g group, when compared to OE only and P.g only groups. Mechanical stress caused by OE activated the Hippo-YAP pathway in periodontal tissues and upregulated the expression of JNK/AP-1. OE with P.g further promoted the expression of YAP and JNK/AP1, leading to the upregulation of the JNK/AP-1 related inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL6. Similar results were obtained when osteoblasts were subjected to mechanical stress in vitro. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that periodontitis with TO caused severe inflammation-induced bone resorption. Activation of YAP and upregulation of JNK/AP-1 induced by TO potentially aggravated the symptoms of PD.

AB  - Summary The nutritionally rich intestinal microbiome of animals, including humans and bats, is densely populated and contains both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria as well as opportunistic bacteria. Many bacteria are pathogenic and may cause severe disease or death. Some of the pathogens are able to jump the species barrier and infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Leptospira species bacteria are currently the most common causative agents of zoonotic infection in the world. Some bacteria may help to protect bats from white-nose syndrome by killing G. destructans. Other bacteria are cellulolytic or xylanolytic and break down complex plant carbohydrates, including cellulose, while other bacteria contain enzymes that degrade chitin, found in insect exoskeletons. In addition to bats, a high prevalence of infection is seen in urban dogs and rats, suggesting that these animals are more likely responsible for zoonotic infection of humans.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - Abstract Data from Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD) were analyzed from 1999 to 2006 to examine the effects of different induction strategies at the time of cardiac transplantation. A total of 2090 primary heart transplants were categorized by induction with interleukin-2 receptor blocker (IL-2RB), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or no induction (NI). Probabilities for rejection and infection were estimated with parametric time-related models. Using these models, hazard was calculated for two theoretical patient profiles, one at lower risk for rejection and higher risk of infection (Profile 1) and higher risk for rejection and lower risk of infection (Profile 2). Of the 2090 transplants, 49.8% (1095) did not receive induction, 27.3% (599) received IL-2RB, and 18.0% (396) received ATG. Profile 1 patients had lower hazard for rejection with IL-2RB compared to ATG and NI (p < 0.01), but at the cost of increased risk of infection (5.0 vs. 1.8 vs. 1.6, respectively, at four wk, p < 0.01). Profile 2 patients experienced a fivefold decreased hazard for rejection when treated with IL-2RB compared with ATG and NI (p < 0.01). In patients at high risk of infection, IL-2RB reduced risk of rejection but at the expense of increased hazard for infection.

AB  - Abstract Inflammasomes are signalling platforms that sense a diverse range of microbial products and also a number of stress and damage associated endogenous signals. Inflammasome complexes can be formed by members of the Nod-like receptor family or the PYHIN family member AIM2. Upon formation, inflammasomes trigger proteolysis of caspase-1, which subsequently leads to a potent inflammatory response through the maturation and secretion of IL-1 family cytokines, which can be accompanied by an inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis. Here, we review the sensing mechanisms of the currently characterized inflammasome complexes and discuss how they are involved in the innate immune response against microbial pathogens. We especially highlight recent advances in the molecular understanding of how microbial patterns are detected and discriminated from endogenous compounds by inflammasome sensors. Further, we review how inflammasomes contribute to the anti microbial host defense by cytokine-dependent and cell autonomous mechanisms. This review is part of the review series on host-pathogen interactions. See more reviews from this series..

AB  - Abstract In the present report, we examined the effects of group formation strategy and corral design on wounding and reproduction rates in rhesus macaques. Specifically, we examined group formation using a staged strategy, in which small groups of animals were introduced incrementally over a period of weeks, and a rapid formation strategy, in which all animals were introduced in 1 day. We also examined group formation using a divided corral design that facilitated visual and social separation of individuals, and an undivided corral design that did not facilitate visual or social separation. Dependent measures were wounding and reproductive rates over each of the 2 years that followed group formation. Results indicate that incrementally releasing subgroups of animals, and using a corral design that provides for visual and social separation of individuals, are effective strategies for reducing rates of traumatic wounding when forming multimale-multifemale rhesus macaque breeding groups. However, it must be noted that differences in formation strategy and corral design did not lead to higher reproductive rates. We conclude that incrementally releasing animals in hierarchical subgroups, and using a divided vs. undivided housing design, reduced intra-group wounding and associated demands on veterinary and animal management resources following formation of rhesus macaque breeding groups.

AB  - Summary Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequent cause of severe skin infections. The ability to control the infection is largely dependent on the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (PMN). To gain more insight into the dynamics of PMN migration and host?pathogen interactions in vivo, we used intravital two-photon (2-P) microscopy to visualize S.?aureus skin infections in the mouse. Reporter S.?aureus strains expressing fluorescent proteins were developed, which allowed for detection of the bacteria in vivo. By employing LysM-EGFP mice to visualize PMN, we observed the rapid appearance of PMN in the extravascular space of the dermis and their directed movement towards the focus of infection, which led to the delineation of an abscess within 1 day. Moreover, tracking of transferred labelled bone-marrow neutrophils showed that PMN localization to the site of infection is dependent on the presence of G-protein-coupled receptors on the PMN, whereas Interleukin-1 receptor was required on host cells other than PMN. Furthermore, the S.?aureus complement inhibitor Ecb could block PMN accumulation at thesite of infection. Our results establish that 2-P microscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the orchestration of the immune cells, S.?aureus location and gene expression in vivo on a single cell level.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the extent of visual recovery after multi-disciplinary approach of treatment in serious ocular injuries; to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor final visual outcome and suggest adequate precautionary measures. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 325 consecutive patients with direct ocular trauma who were examined and treated at a tertiary eye care centre in South India over a 3-year period was undertaken. Results: Males (86.8%) outnumbered the females (13.2%) and children (<16 years) constituted 46.8% of the total affected population. Anterior segment was involved in 51.1%, the posterior segment in 8.9% and both anterior and posterior segments were involved in 31.4% of patients. Prompt and meticulous surgical treatment restored useful vision (better than or equal to 6/18) in 60.5% of patients. Post-treatment, a reduction in blindness and visual impairment rates in the affected eye with respect to WHO classification was 66.7 and 54.1% respectively (P < 0.0001). Two eyes needed prompt enucleation. The factors associated with visual impairment (visual acuity less than 6/18) were poor initial visual acuity, full chamber hyphema, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and vitreous haemorrhage. Conclusions: Direct ocular trauma remains an important potentially preventable cause of ocular morbidity, but the advent of modern surgical techniques can often restore useful vision in such situations. Mandatory use of protective eye wear at work, public health education including awareness on the part of parents to the potential dangers of some childrens? toys can to an extent help reduce ocular morbidity due to direct ocular trauma.

AB  - Summary Most directly transmitted infections require some form of close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts to spread. Often disease models assume contacts are equal and use mean field estimates of transmission probability for all interactions with infectious hosts. Such methods may inaccurately describe transmission when interactions differ substantially in their ability to cause infection. Understanding this variation in transmission risk may be critical to properly model and manage some infectious diseases. In this study, we investigate how varying exposure and transmission may be key to understanding disease dynamics in the threatened desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii. We created heterogeneity in Mycoplasma agassizii exposure (the putative bacterial agent of a respiratory disease) by varying the duration of interactions between naturally infected and uninfected captive desert tortoises. Using qPCR, we identified new infections and compared models of transmission probability as a function of contact duration and pathogen load. We then examined the contact patterns of a wild tortoise population using proximity loggers to identify heterogeneity in contact duration. The top-ranked model predicting M. agassizii transmission included a dose term defined as the product of the number of days in proximity to an infected host and the infection level of that host. Models predicted low transmission probability for short interactions, unless the infectious host had a high load of M. agassizii: such hosts were predicted to transmit infection at higher rates with any amount of contact. We observed predominantly short-lived interactions in a free-ranging tortoise population and thus, expect transmission patterns in this population to vary considerably with the frequency and duration of high infection levels. Mean field models may misrepresent natural transmission patterns in this and other populations depending on the distribution of high-risk contact and shedding events. Rapid outbreaks in generally solitary species may result from changes to their naturally low-risk contact patterns or due to increases in the frequency of severe infections or super-shedding events ? population characteristics that should be further investigated to develop effective management strategies.

AB  - Abstract This article reviews in both directions the recent literature on the relationship between Eating Disorders (ED) and chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to shed some light on an area of comorbidity for too long overlooked. PTSD may be the commonest anxiety disorder in ED but it seems to be independent from ED. Clinicians should be aware that PTSD might represent more than just an occasional occurrence in ED clinical work and should know how to approach it.

AB  - Objective: To describe the rates of serious bacterial illness (SBI) in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with first-time uncomplicated febrile seizures. Methods: The ED visits from seven Chicago metropolitan area hospitals (two tertiary pediatric EDs, five community general EDs) for all pediatric patients seen between July 1995 and December 1997 with a discharge diagnosis including the term ?seizure? were retrospectively identified. Records of patients who met criteria for simple, first-time febrile seizure were reviewed (age 6-60 months; temperature ≥38.0°C; single, generalized, tonic?clonic seizure <20 minutes; absence of known central nervous system disease). Rates of bacteremia, urinary tract infection, bacterial meningitis, and pneumonia were determined. Results: Four hundred fifty-five children were identified who had first-time simple febrile seizures. The study participants had a mean age of 21 months and a mean temperature of 39.6°C, and 64% were male. Seventy-three percent were seen in a community hospital setting. Blood cultures were obtained for 315 children (69%). Four children (1.3% [95% CI = 0.1% to 2.5%]) were bacteremic, all with Streptococcus pneumoniae; the rate of bacteremia did not differ in the subset at highest risk for bacteremia (6-36 months, temperature >39°C). No demographic or laboratory data distinguished the bacteremic children from those with negative blood cultures. One hundred seventy-one children (38%) had urine cultures obtained; 5.9% [95% CI = 2.4% to 9.4%] of the cultures grew >100,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single pathogenic organism. One hundred thirty-five children (30%) had cerebrospinal fluid cultures performed. None of these cultures grew a bacterial pathogen [95% CI = 0% to 2.2%]. Two hundred eight children (45.7%) had chest x-rays performed; 12.5% [95% CI = 10.2% to 14.8%] (n= 26) of the x-rays were read as consistent with pneumonia by the radiologist at the treating institution. None of the blood cultures performed on children with abnormal radiographs were positive (cultures drawn on 23 of 26 patients, 88%). Stool cultures were performed on 14 children (3.1%); two cultures (14.3% [95% CI = 0% to 32.6%]) grew a bacterial pathogen, both Shigella. Conclusions: Rates of SBI in this multi-institution population of children with first-time simple febrile seizures were low and are consistent with those published in the literature for febrile children without seizures.

AB  - A 31 year-old female presented with fever, arthralgias and myalgia ten days after returning from Zimbabwe. On physical exam she had scattered small, pink papules over the lower abdomen and two hemorrhagic pustules with central necrosis (eschars) on her left leg and left buttock. There was inquinal lymphadenopathy with no splenomegaly or hepatomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed which showed necrotizing vasculitis with ulceration of overlying epidermis and papillary dermis. Immunohistochemical studies performed at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention were positive for spotted group Rickettsiae. Treatment with doxycycline 200?mg/d for two weeks resulted in complete recovery. The clinical and histopathologic findings were consistent with Tick Bite Fever caused by Rickettsia africae.
