AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - ABSTRACT The pathogenic mechanisms underlying idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) remain enigmatic. Recent findings suggest that inflammatory processes are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. Enhanced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, has been found in association with glial cells in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. To determine the potential role for TNF-α in PD, we examined the effects of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a dopaminergic neurotoxin that mimics some of the key features associated with PD, using transgenic mice lacking TNF receptors. Administration of MPTP to wild-type (+/+) mice resulted in a time-dependent expression of TNF-α in striatum, which preceded the loss of dopaminergic markers and reactive gliosis. In contrast, transgenic mice carrying homozygous mutant alleles for both the TNF receptors (TNFR-DKO), but not the individual receptors, were completely protected against the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MPTP. The data indicate that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is an obligatory component of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, because TNF-α is synthesized predominantly by microglia and astrocytes, our findings implicate the participation of glial cells in MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Similar mechanisms may underlie the etiopathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases affecting humans. Dental biofilm is a contributor to the etiology of most periodontal diseases. It is also widely accepted that immunological and inflammatory responses to biofilm components are manifested by signs and symptoms of periodontal disease. The outcome of such interaction is modulated by risk factors (modifiers), either inherent (genetic) or acquired (environmental), significantly affecting the initiation and progression of different periodontal disease phenotypes. While definitive genetic determinants responsible for either susceptibility or resistance to periodontal disease have yet to be identified, many factors affecting the pathogenesis have been described, including smoking, diabetes, obesity, medications, and nutrition. Currently, periodontal diseases are classified based upon clinical disease traits using radiographs and clinical examination. Advances in genomics, molecular biology, and personalized medicine may result in new guidelines for unambiguous disease definition and diagnosis in the future. Recent studies have implied relationships between periodontal diseases and systemic conditions. Answering critical questions regarding host-parasite interactions in periodontal diseases may provide new insight in the pathogenesis of other biomedical disorders. Therapeutic efforts have focused on the microbial nature of the infection, as active treatment centers on biofilm disruption by non-surgical mechanical debridement with antimicrobial and sometimes anti-inflammatory adjuncts. The surgical treatment aims at gaining access to periodontal lesions and correcting unfavorable gingival/osseous contours to achieve a periodontal architecture that will provide for more effective oral hygiene and periodontal maintenance. In addition, advances in tissue engineering have provided innovative means to regenerate/repair periodontal defects, based upon principles of guided tissue regeneration and utilization of growth factors/biologic mediators. To maintain periodontal stability, these treatments need to be supplemented with long-term maintenance (supportive periodontal therapy) programs.

AB  - Abstract Orofacial clefts of the lip and/or palate comprise one of the most common craniofacial birth defects in humans. Though a majority of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P) occurs as isolated congenital anomalies, there exist a large number of Mendelian disorders in which orofacial clefting is part of the clinical phenotype. Here we report on two individuals and one multi-generational family with microdeletions at 20p12.3 that include the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene. In two propositi the deletion was almost identical at ?600?kb in size, and BMP2 was the only gene deleted; the third case had a ?5.5-Mb deletion (20p13p12.2) that encompassed at least 20 genes including BMP2. Clinical features were significant for cleft palate and facial dysmorphism in all three patients, including Pierre-Robin sequence in two. Microdeletion 20p13p12 involving BMP2 is rare and has been implicated in Wolff?Parkinson?White (WPW) syndrome with neurocognitive deficits and with Alagille syndrome when the deletion includes the neighboring JAG1 gene in addition to BMP2. Despite a significant role for the BMPs in orofacial development, heterozygous loss of BMP2 has not been previously reported in patients with syndromic clefting defects. Because BMP2 was the sole deleted gene in Patients 1 and 2 and one of the genes deleted in Patient 3, all of whom had clinical features in common, we suggest that haploinsufficiency for BMP2 is a crucial event that predisposes to cleft palate and additional anomalies. Lack of significant phenotypic components in family members of Patient 1 suggests variable expressivity for the phenotype. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The time and cost of developing new drugs have led many groups to limit their search for therapeutics to compounds that have previously been approved for human use. Many ?repurposed? drugs, such as derivatives of thalidomide, antibiotics, and antivirals have had clinical success in treatment areas well beyond their original approved use. These include applications in treating antibiotic-resistant organisms, viruses, cancers and to prevent burn scarring. The major theoretical justification for reusing approved drugs is that they have known modes of action and controllable side effects. Coadministering antibiotics with inhibitors of bacterial toxins or enzymes that mediate multidrug resistance can greatly enhance their activity. Drugs that control host cell pathways, including inflammation, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and autophagy, can reduce the ?cytokine storm? response to injury, control infection, and aid in cancer therapy. An active compound, even if previously approved for human use, will be a poor clinical candidate if it lacks specificity for the new target, has poor solubility or can cause serious side effects. Synergistic combinations can reduce the dosages of the individual components to lower reactivity. Preclinical analysis should take into account that severely ill patients with comorbidities will be more sensitive to side effects than healthy trial subjects. Once an active, approved drug has been identified, collaboration with medicinal chemists can aid in finding derivatives with better physicochemical properties, specificity, and efficacy, to provide novel therapies for cancers, emerging and rare diseases.

AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.

Study design Review. Methods and databases Multiple literature searches were performed using PubMed and Google Scholar from March 2012 through November 2013. Relevant anesthetic and immune terms were used to search databases without year published or species constraints. The online database for Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia and the Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care were searched by issue starting in 2000 for relevant articles. Conclusion Sedatives, injectable anesthetics, opioids, and local anesthetics have immunomodulatory effects that may have positive or negative consequences on disease processes such as endotoxemia, generalized sepsis, tumor growth and metastasis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, anesthetists should consider the immunomodulatory effects of anesthetic drugs when designing anesthetic protocols for their patients.

AB  - Abstract Surgical sutures are used to facilitate closure and healing of surgical- or trauma-induced wounds by upholding tissues together to facilitate healing process. There is a wide range of suture materials for medical purpose and the main types include absorbable and nonabsorbable. Recently, there is a growth in the development of classes of suture materials based on their properties and capabilities to improve tissue approximation and wound closure. This review outlines and discusses the current and emerging trends in suture technology including knotless barbed sutures, antimicrobial sutures, bio-active sutures such as drug-eluting and stem cells seeded sutures, and smart sutures including elastic, and electronic sutures. These newer strategies expand the versatility of sutures from being used as just a physical entity approximating opposing tissues to a more biologically active component enabling delivery of drugs and cells to the desired site with immense application potential in both therapeutics and diagnostics. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary Multi-factorial causes jeopardize brain integrity in ?-thalassaemia. Intracranial parenchymal and vascular changes have been reported among young ?-thalassaemia patients but conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are contradictory making early MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)/venography monitoring a matter of debate. This study prospectively investigated 75 neurologically asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients (mean-age 35·2 ± 10·7 years; 52/75 transfusion-dependent; 41/75 splenectomised) using a 3T magnetic resonance scanner; clinical, laboratory and treatment data were also collected. White matter ischaemic-like abnormalities, intracranial artery stenoses, aneurysms and sinus venous thrombosis were compared between patients and 56 healthy controls (mean-age 33·9 ± 10·8 years). No patient or control showed silent territorial or lacunar strokes, intracranial artery stenoses or signs of sinus thrombosis. White matter lesions were found both in patients (35/75, 46·7%) and controls (28/56, 50·0%), without differences in terms of number (4·0 ± 10·6 vs. 4·6 ± 9·1, P = 0·63), size and Fazekas? Score. Intracranial aneurysms did not differ between patients and controls for incidence rate (7/75, 9·3% vs. 5/56, 8·9%), size and site. Vascular and parenchymal abnormality rate did not differ according to treatments or clinical phenotype. According to this study, asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients treated according to current guidelines do not seem to carry an increased risk of brain and intracranial vascular changes, thus weakening recommendations for regular brain MRI monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Background Multigene panel sequencing (MGPS) is the first-line option in diagnostic testing for genetically heterogeneous but clinically similar conditions, such as neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). In this study, we aimed to assess the utility of comprehensive NMD MGPS and the need for updated panels. Methods All patients were analyzed by either of two versions of the NMD MGPS and by chromosomal microarray and karyotype testing. Four patients with negative NMD MGPS results underwent whole exome sequencing. Results In total, 91 patients were enrolled, and a genetic diagnosis was made in 36 (39.6%); of these, 33 were diagnosed by the comprehensive NMD MGPS, two were confirmed by chromosomal microarray, and one was diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. For MGPS, the diagnostic yield of Version 2 (19/52; 36.5%) was a little higher than that of Version 1 (14/39; 35.9%), and one gene identified in Version 2 was not included in Version 1. A total of 36 definitive and nine possible causative variants were identified, of which 17 were novel. Conclusion A more comprehensive panel for NMD MGPS can improve the diagnostic efficiency in genetic testing. The rapid discovery of new disease-causing genes over recent years necessitates updates to existing gene panels.

Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.

AB  - Nucleic acid detection methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can often detect specific microbial pathogens, virulence markers and antimicrobial resistance genes more rapidly and with greater sensitivity and specificity than culture and conventional identification and susceptibility testing. Multiplex PCR can detect multiple genes in a single assay; this capability will be greatly extended by new techniques such as the DNA chip. However, limitations and pitfalls of nucleic detection methods remain.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the relationship between service-connection (financial compensation) and exaggeration of PTSD symptoms. Sixty inpatient Vietnam combat veterans in PTSD treatment comprised three groups: those financially compensated for PTSD, those financially compensated for physical or other mental problems, and those not financially compensated. Results indicate that those veterans who are not service-connected do not exaggerate symptoms on the MMPI F-scale more than those who are service-connected. Also, F scores reported for inpatient PTSD were higher than previously established cut-off criteria found chiefly in outpatient populations. Implications for therapists' biases concerning financial compensation and symptom claims are discussed in terms of their clinical relevance.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine meropenem concentrations in radiocarpal (RC) joint fluid and plasma after intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP). Study design In vivo experimental study. Animals Nine healthy adult mares. Methods Meropenem (500 mg) was injected in the forelimb of standing sedated horses via IVRLP with a pneumatic tourniquet inflated to 400 mmHg. Synovial fluid was collected from RC joints at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours after meropenem injection. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at the same time points and at 5 and 15 minutes following injection. Meropenem concentrations were determined by using a microbiological bioassay. Results Median synovial fluid concentrations reached a time of maximum synovial fluid concentration 0.5 hours after IVRLP. Synovial fluid concentrations varied greatly, with a mean maximum synovial fluid concentration of 25.6 µg/mL (range, below limit of quantitation to 75.5). Concentrations remained above the breakpoint for susceptibility (1 µg/mL) for 3 hours (last nonzero concentration measured, median) and 4.1 hours (predicted, mean). Concentrations >6 µg/mL were measured for 2 hours (observed, median) and 1.7 hours (predicted, mean). Six horses had mild swelling at the injection site. Conclusion Administration of 500 mg meropenem resulted in highly variable concentrations between horses and achieved levels above clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration for a minor portion of a once-daily dosing interval. Clinical significance If time-dependent pharmacodynamics apply, IVRLP with 500 mg of meropenem may be ineffective and would likely promote resistance.

AB  - Summary Orthodontic forces, the prescription for correcting malocclusions, are considered to have a multi-potential nature. Research has also shed light on the elevated levels of signaling molecules in the gingival crevicular fluid of moving teeth, both useful and harmful to the human body. The main effects, which are categorized as periodontal destruction following orthodontic mechanics, are loss of attachment and bone loss. External apical root resorption (EARR) entails a permanent shortening of dental roots, and formation of large lacunae that erode the roots laterally. Lacerations or irritations to oral mucosal tissues are a common clinical observation in the orthodontic office. Allergy or sensitivity reactions may occur with alloying components such as nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are often incorporated in orthodontic attachments and archwires.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis and infections associated with orthopedic implants represent a significant burden of disease worldwide. Ceragenins (CSAs) are a relatively new class of small-molecule antimicrobials that target a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi, viruses, and parasites. This review sets the context of the need for new antimicrobial strategies by cataloging the common pathogens associated with orthopedic infection and highlighting the increasing challenges of managing antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. It then comparatively describes the antimicrobial properties of CSAs with a focus on the CSA-13 family. More recently developed members of this family such as CSA-90 and CSA-131 may have a particular advantage in an orthopedic setting as they possess secondary pro-osteogenic properties. In this context, we consider several new preclinical studies that demonstrate the utility of CSAs in orthopedic models. Emerging evidence suggests that CSAs are effective against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and can prevent the formation of biofilms. There remains considerable scope for developing CSA-based treatments, either as coatings for orthopedic implants or as local or systemic antibiotics to prevent bone infection.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common autosomally inherited bleeding disorder associated with mucosal or trauma-related bleeding in affected individuals. VWD results from a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that is essential for primary haemostasis and that carries and protects coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. Through characterization of the phenotype and identification of mutations in the VWF gene in patients with VWD, understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of VWF and VWD has advanced considerably. The importance of specific regions of VWF for its interaction with other components of the vasculature has been revealed, and this has facilitated the formal classification of VWD into three subtypes based upon quantitative (types 1 and 3) and qualitative (type 2) deficiency of VWF. The underlying genetic lesions and associated molecular pathology have been identified in many cases of the qualitative type 2 VWD variants (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N) and in the severe quantitative deficiency, type 3 VWD. However in the partial quantitative deficiency, type 1 VWD, the picture is less clear: there is a variable relationship between plasma levels of VWF and bleeding, there is incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity within affected families, the causative molecular defect is unknown in a substantial number of cases, and even in those cases where the causative mutation is known, the associated molecular pathology is not necessarily understood. This guideline aims to provide a framework for best laboratory practice for the genetic diagnosis of VWD, based upon current knowledge and understanding.
