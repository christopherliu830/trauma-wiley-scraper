AB  - ObjectivesTo compare wound infection rates for irrigation with tap water versus sterile saline before closure of wounds in the emergency department. MethodsThe study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial conducted at two Level 1 urban hospitals and a suburban community hospital. Subjects were a convenience sample of adults presenting with acute simple lacerations requiring sutures or staples. Subjects were randomized to irrigation in a sink with tap water or with normal saline using a sterile syringe. Wounds were closed in the standard fashion. Subjects were asked to return to the emergency department for suture removal. Those who did not return were contacted by telephone. Wounds were considered infected if there was early removal of sutures or staples, if there was irrigation and drainage of the wound, or if the subject needed to be placed on antibiotics. Equivalence of the groups was met if there was less than a doubling of the infection rate. ResultsA total of 715 subjects were enrolled in the study. Follow-up data were obtained on 634 (88%) of enrolled subjects. Twelve (4%) of the 300 subjects in the tap water group had wound infections, compared with 11 (3.3%) of the 334 subjects in the saline group. The relative risk was 1.21 (95% confidence interval = 0.5 to 2.7). ConclusionsEquivalent rates of wound infection were found using either irrigant. The results of this multicenter trial evaluating tap water as an irrigant agree with those from previous single institution trials.

AB  - Abstract Causal theory and causal models have proven to be helpful in understanding the multi-factorial causation of many diseases, including periodontitis. The design and application of causal models is essential to the appropriate design, conduct and analysis of studies on periodontal disease causation. This review discusses the principles of causation and causal theory, both in general and as they pertain to studies of the etiology of periodontitis. Specifically, we present an overview of models of causation, including the potential outcomes model, the sufficient component cause model, and directed acyclic graphical models. More thorough explanations and accompanying illustrations are provided for the sufficient component cause model and the directed acyclic graphical model. Topics related to the study of periodontitis, as illustrated by such models, include the principles of confounding and effect measure modification (interaction). Existing models of periodontitis etiology are critically reviewed in this context.

AB  - Widespread expression of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), which maintains redox homeostasis, has recently been identified in the hair follicle (HF). Small molecule activators of NRF2 may therefore be useful in the management of HF pathologies associated with redox imbalance, ranging from HF greying and HF ageing via androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata to chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Indeed, NRF2 activation has been shown to prevent peroxide-induced hair growth inhibition. Multiple parameters can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species in the HF, for example melanogenesis, depilation-induced trauma, neurogenic and autoimmune inflammation, toxic drugs, environmental stressors such as UV irradiation, genetic defects and aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, the potential mechanisms whereby NRF2 activation could prove beneficial in treatment of redox-associated HF disorders are therefore discussed.

AB  - Summary Largely based on the fact that administration of purified lipopolysaccharide induces many of the signs of circulatory insufficiency that occur in horses with a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, these signs have been linked with the term endotoxemia. However, differences between experimentally induced endotoxemia and the clinical syndrome of endotoxemia have been recognized by veterinary clinicians. A similar situation exists in human medicine where the term ?systemic inflammatory response syndrome? (SIRS) was coined for the clinical responses of human patients to nonspecific insults (i.e., in the absence of a documented infection). Our current knowledge regarding the systemic inflammatory response to bacterial ligands provides the basis for reconsidering the widespread usage of the term endotoxemia in equine clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Noonan syndrome (NS) is a heterogeneous developmental disorder caused by missense mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, a major mediator of early and late developmental processes. The diagnosis of NS is made on clinical grounds with molecular confirmation of a mutation found in 63% of cases. Key clinical features include short stature, cardiac defects, developmental delay, lymphatic dysplasias, bleeding tendency, and a constellation of distinctive facial features and physical exam findings. The prevalence of medical issues or the development of new ones in adults with NS is not well-studied. This cross-sectional study reports on the prevalence of clinical conditions and their ages of onset in a cohort of 35 adolescents and adults with NS aged 16?68 years old (mean age 28 years). In this cohort, 34 of 35 subjects (97%) had had full PTPN11 sequencing; 37% were PTPN11 positive, 23% were SOS1 positive, and 3% were BRAF positive. Mean adult height in both men and women was at the 3rd?10th centile. The most prevalent clinical findings in this cohort included pulmonary valve stenosis (71%), easy bruising (63%), GERD (60%), constipation (51%), scoliosis (54%), chronic joint pain (54%), lymphedema (49%), depression (49%), anxiety (49%), Chiari malformation (20%), and osteopenia/osteoporosis (14%). In summary, adults with NS are affected by multi-organ morbidity and require special medical management aimed towards the most prevalent and serious known medical complications. Larger studies characterizing the clinical conditions found in NS adults are needed to provide potential genotype?phenotype correlations that may aid in clinical management. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The aetiological agents of many invasive fungal infections are saprobes and opportunistic pathogens. Some of these fungi are darkly pigmented due to melanin production and traditionally have been named ?dematiaceous?. The melanized fungi cause a wide array of clinical syndromes ranging from superficial to deep-seated infections. Diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of clinical specimens and on examination of cultures. Sequencing is recommended for accurate species identification, especially for unusual or newly described pathogens. In cases of mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, pathognomonic histological findings are useful and the Fontana?Masson stain, specific for melanin, usually confirms the diagnosis. There are no standardized therapies but voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole demonstrate the most consistent in vitro activity against this group of fungi. Oral itraconazole has been considered the drug of choice, given the extensive clinical experience with this drug. However, voriconazole may presumably be superior for central nervous system infections because of its ability to achieve good levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Posaconazole is a well-tolerated alternative drug, backed by less clinical experience but with excellent salvage treatment results after failure of other antifungals. Amphotericin B has been useful as alternative therapy in some cases. Combination antifungal therapy is recommended for cerebral abscesses when surgery is not possible and for disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients.

AB  - Objectives:?? Extended radical pelvic resection for advanced primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy is an increasingly common procedure in major colorectal units. Aggressive pre operative chemo-radio therapy creates a cohort of patients with difficult reconstructive variables. We review our plastic surgical reconstructions in this highly heterogeneous population. Method:?? Utilizing the coding system at our institution we identified a cohort of patients whom underwent Vertical Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (VRAM) reconstruction for exenterative pelvic surgery. A thorough retrospective case note analysis was performed specifically looking at three variable subsets. Demographic data and peri-operative care Reconstructive surgical procedures and complications Tumour variables and patient survival outcomes Results:?? Statistical analysis of the patient cohort and subsets will be presented Conclusions:?? This study has demonstrated the versatility of the VRAM flap in obtaining a stable and supple reconstructive cover in advanced pelvic malignancy surgery. Our series confirms strong support for immediate VRAM reconstruction in all pelvic exenterative procedures. We have shown patients undergoing multi-visceral resection after prior chemo-radiotherapy can achieve early, healed and stable perineal closure with low morbidity.

AB  - Abstract In an attempt to assess the importance of different aspects of the immediate wound environment during an operation, detailed bacteriological data were obtained in the operating theatre from 1000 patients operated upon in two different theatres. Nasal and skin carriage of Staphylococcus pyogenes were found to be associated with a small number of autogenous infections, but no significant increase in the staphylococcal wound infection incidence could be shown in these groups. Skin carriage of other pathogens seemed to be of no importance with the disinfection methods used in the present study. Settle-plate studies showed no apparent difference in the bacteriological hazard of the two operating theatre environments, neither appearing to constitute any real danger. Samples at the end of operation confirmed the importance of endogenous contamination with intestinal organisms during potentially dirty operations. Apart from the few autogenous infections, there was little evidence of staphylococcal wound sepsis arising as a result of contamination in the operating theatre. Hands and masks of members of the operating team could not be demonstrated as sources of contamination during operation. There was no apparent difference in the bacteriological findings as they related to the different operating theatre environments.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of deep surgical site infection (DSSI) during hospitalisation after closed tibial plateau fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). We performed this retrospective study at a university-affiliated hospital with an advanced trauma centre. The data of adult patients with closed tibial plateau fractures treated with ORIF from January 2012 to February 2017 were extracted from the electronic medical records. Demographics, injury-related and surgery-related variables of DSSI and non-DSSI groups were compared by univariate test. Multivariate logistic analysis models were used to investigate the independent risk factors. In total, 676 patients with complete data met the inclusion criteria and were included, and of them, 17 developed DSSI (2.51%) during hospitalisation. Approximately 60% (9/17) of DSSI was caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to the non-DSSI group, DSSI patients had a significantly longer stay in hospital (25.8 vs 15.2?days). Independent risk factors of DSSI identified by multivariate analysis were higher BMI (>26.0) (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.27; P?=?0.032), prolonged surgical duration (>138?min) (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.54 to 11.19; P?=?0.005) and current smoking (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.47 to 8.62; P?=?0.01). A relatively low incidence rate of DSSI (2.51%) was found in this study, and several significant risk factors were identified. Smoking cessation programmes should be implemented immediately after hospitalisation, especially for obesity and morbid obesity patients. Detailed and comprehensive preoperative assessment and a considerate operative plan should be guaranteed to reduce surgical duration.

AB  - Abstract Pain and speed of convalescence are the two main problems after uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We therefore identified interventional and descriptive studies in electronic databases and supplemented them with manual searches. Pain and interventional analgesic studies were analysed with reference to the effects on specific pain components after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Convalescence and factors associated with early recovery were also analysed. Pain after cholecystectomy is most intense for the first 2?3 days with a high interindividual variability and dominated by incisional pain rather than other pain components. Early pain after cholecystectomy is reduced by minimising residual pneumoperitoneum and by giving incisional local anaesthetics, epidural analgesia, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are inconclusive data about type and pressure of pneumoperitoneum, the use of intraperitoneal local anaesthetics, and the type of general anaesthesia. Pain and medico-cultural traditions are the main factors responsible for prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To minimise pain and the duration of convalescence, we recommend multi-modal analgesic treatment in combination with short, standardised instructions to resume work and normal activity.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

Study Design Descriptive repeated measures experimental study. Animals Dogs (n?=?9). Methods Stifle joint inflammation was caused by urate injection. Twenty-four hours later a GICS (gentamicin dose, 6?mg/kg) was arthroscopically implanted. Synovial fluid and plasma gentamicin concentrations were measured for 14 days after implantation, and pharmacokinetic parameters modeled using statistical moment analyses. Results Intra-articular gentamicin concentrations fell to sub-MIC for Staphylococcus sp. (4?µg/mL) by 22.4?hours (95% CI: 18.6?26.2) after sponge implantation. Cmax synovial was 2397?µg/mL (95%CI: 1161?3634?µg/mL) at 1.2?hours (95%CI: 0.5?1.8?hours). Plasma gentamicin concentrations achieved levels of Cmax plasma?=?8.0?µg/mL (95%CI: 6.1?10.0?µg/mL) at 1.5?hours (95%CI: 0.8?2.1) after GICS placement and fell below target trough of 2.0?µg/mL by 5.6?hours (95%CI: 4.7?6.5?hours) after GICS placement. Conclusions Intra-articular gentamicin concentration after GICS placement at an IV-equivalent dose reached high levels and declined rapidly. The maximum plasma levels attained were ?1/3 of the recommended sub-toxic target for people after parenteral gentamicin administration.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Accumulations of mucus within the trachea are often found during endoscopic examinations of the airways of poorly performing racehorses, but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of tracheal mucus, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) and cytological indices of tracheal aspirate on racing performance in Thoroughbred horses assessed by race place and whether the horse was raced. Methods: Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea was performed, and a tracheal aspirate obtained monthly at Thistledown racetrack from April to December, 2002 and 2003. Horses received a score of 0?4 for the degree of PLH and 0?4 for the amount of mucus visible in the trachea. The tracheal aspirate was assessed for turbidity, and total and differential cell counts. Generalised estimating equations models were used as repeated measures models for each risk factor and the level of association assessed through the risk factor's P value in the model. Results: Moderate to severe tracheal mucus (2?4) was a risk factor for poor racing performance. There was no association between degree of PLH, cell counts or turbidity of tracheal wash fluid and racing performance. However, horses that raced had higher total neutrophil counts in tracheal wash aspirates than horses that did not race. Conclusions: Grades 2?4 tracheal mucus should be considered a potential cause of poor racing performance in Thoroughbred horses. Clinical relevance: Because moderate to severe tracheal mucus accumulation, and not increased tracheal neutrophils, was a risk factor for poor racing performance, functionally significant airway inflammation may best be confirmed by the presence of mucus rather than increased number of neutrophils in the trachea.

Methods: A prospective study of 100 peripherally placed intravenous catheters from 13 cats and 78 dogs was conducted. The distal two-thirds were removed and submitted for bacterial and fungal cultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility of each isolate was determined. Results: Nineteen peripheral catheters were positive for microbiologic culture from 14 animals. Twenty organisms were isolated among which Staphylococcus species was the most common. Isolates displayed lower levels of resistance against the antimicrobial agents amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins and gentamicin than against other agents tested. Major risk factors predisposing to catheter-related colonisation included dextrose infusion, duration of catheter placement, local complications and immunosuppressive diseases or drugs. Clinical Significance: In a routine clinical setting, the prevalence of microbial colonisation of peripheral intravenous catheters is comparable to that found in an intensive care unit. However, consequences on morbidity and mortality rates differ.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) remains a major clinical problem and is often refractory to current treatments. New analgesic medications and strategies for pain relief are needed. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to be a multi-functional growth factor and regulates various biological activities. Methods We investigated the analgesic effect and underlying mechanism of plasmid pUDK-HGF encoding human HGF gene on CPSP induced by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in rats. The possible changes of inflammatory factors, glial cell activation and pain sensitivity after pUDK-HGF administration were investigated by ELISA, western blot and Von Frey tests, respectively. Results In behavioural assays, we found that a single intramuscular or intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF significantly attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation of plantar ipsilateral hind paw after SMIR. Intramuscular injection of pUDK-HGF promoted blood flow and proliferation of satellite cells and inhibited inflammatory cells recruitment, collagen accumulation and expression of pronociceptive factors. Intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF inhibited activation of spinal glial cells and production of inflammatory mediators induced by SMIR. Conclusions pUDK-HGF has a strong analgesic potency and efficacy in CPSP induced by SMIR in rats. This study highlights a new strategy for the treatment of CPSP. Significance The CPSP occurs following various surgical procedures and remains a major clinical problem due to the lack of study on the mechanisms of CPSP. Our findings provide the first evidence that pUDK-HGF attenuates SMIR-induced pain behaviuors through peripheral or central mechanisms. The peripheral analgesic effect of pUDK-HGF is associated with promoting tissue repair and inhibiting inflammatory response; furthermore, pUDK-HGF inhibits activation of spinal glial cells and overexpression of inflammatory mediators in spinal cord. Therefore, naked pUDK-HGF may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of CPSP in clinic.

AB  - The 14th Annual Meeting of the Winter Conference on Neural Plasticity was held in Moorea, French Polynesia from February 22 ? March 02, 2002. The Conference was attended by approximately 80 participants from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Hungary, New Zealand and the United States. Most of the participants were neuroscientists from universities and basic research departments of applied institutions. The primary focus of the conference is to annually review recent advances in the area of neural plasticity from multi-disciplinary and lifespan perspectives. There was an initial ?New Concepts Session? and nine scientific sessions each lasting two hours.

AB  - Objectives To examine the clinical signs, laboratory findings, possible predisposing factors, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcomes of dogs and cats diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by Corynebacterium urealyticum. Materials and Methods Retrospective, observational study of dogs and cats that were diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum. Results This report concerns a total of 11 dogs and 10 cats. All cats had a history of urethral catheterisation, and six cats had undergone urological surgery before diagnosis of this specific infection. Dogs had history of neurogenic urinary incontinence (n=5), urethral catheterisation (n=4), urological surgery (n=4), lower urinary tract disease (n=2) or prostatic disease (n=1). In seven animals, previous urine culture was negative. Median urine pH was 8.6 (interquartile range 7.5 to 9), and 19 animals had pyuria and struvite crystalluria. Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in nine animals. All but one isolate were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes. Thirteen isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines. There was bacterial and clinical resolution of the infection in nine dogs and seven cats. Two animals died from sepsis and two cats were euthanased because of clinical deterioration. Clinical Significance Urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum should be suspected in animals with pre-existing urinary disorders, especially if urine is alkaline and there is struvite crystalluria, negative routine urine culture and encrusted cystitis.

AB  - Summary Heterogeneity of dendritic cells (DC) is evident in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and determined, in part, by incompletely understood local environmental factors. Bacterial signalling is likely to be a dominant influence on precursor cells when recruited to the mucosa. We assessed the influence of commensal bacteria on DC differentiation and function. Murine bone marrow progenitors were exposed to Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium breve or Bifidobacterium infantis. Differences in cell surface phenotype and function were assessed. Myeloid differentiation factor 88?/? (MyD88) cells were used to determine the influence of Toll-like receptor signalling. While bacterial strains varied in impact, there was a consistent dose-dependent inhibition of DC differentiation with a shift toward a Gr-1+?CD11b+ monocyte-like phenotype. A single bacterium on a per cell basis (1?:?1) was sufficient to alter cell phenotype. The effect was only evident in early precursors. Enhanced interleukin-10 production correlated with increased Forkhead box P3 expression and reduced T-cell proliferation. The bacterial effect on DC differentiation was found to be MyD88-dependent. Signalling by enteric commensals through pattern recognition receptors on precursor cells alters DC differentiation and results in cells that are phenotypically monocyte-like and functionally suppressive. This may account for some of the features of mucosal immune tolerance to the microbiota.
