AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Introduction:?? S epidermidis is a recognised major biofilm pathogen and has been implicated in medical device contamination ranging from artificial hip prostheses to breast implants. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known pathogen in chronic wounds. Within biofilms, bacteria are enclosed in a polymeric matrix or EPS which cements the bacteria to each other and to the surface. Biofilms act to protect the bacteria from the environment increasing resistance to host immunity, antibiotics and biocides. More recently, we have shown that biofilm occurs on the surface of chronic wounds and that this may have aetiological implications. Method:?? Staph spp and pseudomonas spp biofilm were grown on glass coupons using the CDC biofilm reactor for 48?hrs and the coupons randomly inserted into the wound model and for 24?hrs subjected to: 1 No instillation plus TNP 2 0.1% w/v formulated hypocholorous acid instillation plus TNP 3 Saline instillation (no biocide) plus TNP 4 Betadine instillation plus TNP Betadine and saline instillations were for 30?minutes every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. NVC instillation was for 3?minutes, every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. Following treatment, the coupons were carefully extracted to avoid damaging the biofilms. The effect of TNP on the biofilms was then assessed by colony forming units and electron microscopy. Results:?? The results show that lower frequency of instillation did not have significant effect on bacterial load for both types of bacteria. Increase in frequency of instillations resulted in no growth of pseudomonas while increase in frequency of instillations resulted in a significant decrease in staph spp.

AB  - Abstract Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. In the past ALL was intractable but now the survival probability is as high as 80?90%. Improved supportive care, treatment stratification based on relapse risk, biological features of leukemic cells, and optimization of treatment regimens by nationwide and international collaboration have contributed to this dramatic improvement. While including traditional risk factors (e.g. age and leukocyte count at diagnosis), the treatment has been modified based on biological characteristics (aneuploidy and translocation) and treatment response (assessed by minimal residual disease). Treatment for pediatric ALL typically consists of induction therapy with steroids, vincristine, and asparaginase with or without anthracycline, followed by multi-agent consolidation including high-dose methotrexate and re-induction therapy. After consolidation, less intensive maintenance therapy is required for 1?2 years to maintain event-free survival. Recently, using advanced genomic analysis technology, novel sentinel genomic alterations that may provide more precise stratification or therapeutic targets, were identified. Moreover, in the last decade germline variations have been recognized as similarly important contributors to understanding the etiology and sensitivity of ALL to treatment. A more individualized approach based on genomic features (somatic and germline) and treatment response, the introduction of newly developed agents such as molecular targeted drugs or immunotherapy, and social support including long-term follow up are required for further improvement.

AB  - Abstract In this ?Summary Guidance for Daily Practice?, we describe the basic principles of prevention and management of foot problems in persons with diabetes. This summary is based on the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) Guidance 2015. There are five key elements that underpin prevention of foot problems: (1) identification of the at-risk foot; (2) regular inspection and examination of the at-risk foot; (3) education of patient, family and healthcare providers; (4) routine wearing of appropriate footwear; and (5) treatment of pre-ulcerative signs. Healthcare providers should follow a standardized and consistent strategy for evaluating a foot wound, as this will guide further evaluation and therapy. The following items must be addressed: type, cause, site and depth, and signs of infection. There are seven key elements that underpin ulcer treatment: (1) relief of pressure and protection of the ulcer; (2) restoration of skin perfusion; (3) treatment of infection; (4) metabolic control and treatment of co-morbidity; (5) local wound care; (6) education for patient and relatives; and (7) prevention of recurrence. Finally, successful efforts to prevent and manage foot problems in diabetes depend upon a well-organized team, using a holistic approach in which the ulcer is seen as a sign of multi-organ disease, and integrating the various disciplines involved.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the effects of two fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (0.4 and 1) on lung aeration and gas exchange during general anaesthesia in cats. Study design? Randomized, blinded, controlled study. Animals? Thirty healthy, mixed breed, client owned female cats. Materials and methods? Cats were premedicated intramuscularly with acepromazine (0.03?mg?kg?1) and medetomidine (0.015?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (5?mg?kg?1) and, after orotracheal intubation, maintained with isoflurane carried by either 100% oxygen (G100, n?=?15) or an oxygen-air mixture with 40% oxygen (G40, n?=?15). All cats were placed in dorsal recumbency and breathed spontaneously throughout the entire procedure. Following surgery (ovariectomy), a spiral computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was performed, arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) tensions were measured and alveolar?arterial gradient of oxygen [P(A?a)O2] calculated. The CT images were analysed for lung aeration by the analysis of radiograph attenuations (Hounsfield units, HU), according to the following classification: hyperinflated area (?1000 to ?900 HU), normally aerated area (?900 to ?500?HU), poorly aerated area (?500 to ?100?HU) and non-aerated area (?100 to +100?HU). The groups were compared using one-way anova. Results? Compared to G100, the normally-aerated lung area was significantly greater and the poorly-aerated and non-aerated areas were significantly smaller in G40. PaCO2 was similar in both groups. PaO2 and P(A?a)O2 were significantly higher in G100. In both groups, pulmonary atelectasis developed preferentially in the caudal lung fields. Conclusion? In cats anaesthetised with isoflurane, the administration of an FiO2 of >0.9 significantly impaired lung aeration and gas exchange as compared to an FiO2 of 0.4. Clinical relevance? An FiO2 of 0.4 may better preserve lung aeration and gas exchange in anaesthetised spontaneously breathing cats but monitoring is essential to ensure oxygenation is adequate.

AB  - Abstract Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) has emerged as a concerning global pathogen. hvKp is more virulent than classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and capable of causing community-acquired infections, often in healthy individuals. hvKp is carried in the gastrointestinal tract, which contributes to its spread in the community and healthcare settings. First recognized in Asia, hvKp arose as a leading cause of pyogenic liver abscesses. In the decades since, hvKp has spread globally and causes a variety of infections. In addition to liver abscesses, hvKp is distinct from cKp in its ability to metastasize to distant sites, including most commonly the eye, lung and central nervous system (CNS). hvKp has also been implicated in primary extrahepatic infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and soft tissue infections. The genetic determinants of hypervirulence are often found on large virulence plasmids as well as chromosomal mobile genetic elements which can be used as biomarkers to distinguish hvKp from cKp clinical isolates. These distinct virulence determinants of hvKp include up to four siderophore systems for iron acquisition, increased capsule production, K1 and K2 capsule types, and the colibactin toxin. Additionally, hvKp strains demonstrate hypermucoviscosity, a phenotypic description of hvKp in laboratory conditions that has become a distinguishing feature of many hypervirulent isolates. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant hypervirulent strains have emerged, creating a new challenge in combating this already dangerous pathogen.

AB  - Summary Marbofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic expected to be effective in the treatment of infections involving Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria in horses. In order to design a rational dosage regimen for the substance in horses, the pharmacokinetic properties of marbofloxacin were investigated in 6 horses after i.v., subcutaneous and oral administration of a single dose of 2 mg/kg bwt and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) assessed forbacteria isolated from equine infectious pathologies. The clearance of marbofloxacin was mean ± s.d. 0.25 ± 0.05 l/kg/h and the terminal half-life 7.56 ± 1.99 h. The marbofloxacin absolute bioavailabilities after subcutaneous and oral administration were 98 ± 11% and 62 ± 8%, respectively. The MIC required to inhibit 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.027 ?g/ml for enterobacteriaceae and 0.21 ?g/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. The values of surrogate markers of antimicrobial efficacy (AUIC, Cmax/MIC ratio, time above MIC90) were calculated and the marbofloxacin concentration profiles simulated for repeated administrations. These data were used to determine rational dosage regimens for target bacteria. Considering the breakpoint values of efficacy indices for fluoroquinolones, a marbofloxacin dosage regimen of 2 mg/kg bwt/24 h by i.v., subcutaneous or oral routes was more appropriate for enterobacteriaceae than for S. aureus.

AB  - Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the prototype of post-infectious autoimmune neurological disease. Campylobacter Jejuni is the most frequent pathogen antecedent causing a clinical picture characterized by severe, pure motor axonal involvement with IgG antibodies against GM1, GM1b, GD1a or GalNAc-GD1a gangliosides. As for viral infection, CMV is the most common antecedent associated with demyelinating sensory GBS and anti-GM2 IgM antibody. Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia associated with anti-GQ1b IgG antibody. We describe the case of a 41 year-old man who developed muscle weakness with gait disturbance, paresthesiae and pain at four limbs, taste and voice disturbances 9 days after cutaneous eruption by varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. At hospital admission the clinical evaluation showed ataxia, deep tendon areflexia, hyposthenia at lower limbs, hypophonia and dysgeusia. Examination of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed a slight increase in protein concentration with no concomitant pleocytosis; nerve conduction velocity detected the absence of H reflex. At present antibodies titration against gangliosides is under examination. He underwent plasma exchange treatment and is still receiving acyclovir therapy with clinical recovery. Conclusion: this case underlines the clinical variability of acute polyradiculoneuropathy presenting after viral infections other than those classical described with possible overlapping to GB and MF syndrome and confirms the good response to combined gammaglobulin and acyclovir therapy.

AB  - Abstract Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of antimicrobial-resistant hospital-acquired infections worldwide and remains a public health priority in Europe. Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) involving MRSA often affects patients in intensive care units with substantial morbidity, mortality and associated costs. A guideline-based approach to empirical treatment with an antibacterial agent active against MRSA can improve the outcome of patients with MRSA NP, including those with ventilator-associated pneumonia. New methods may allow more rapid or sensitive diagnosis of NP or microbiological confirmation in patients with MRSA NP, allowing early de-escalation of treatment once the pathogen is known. In Europe, available antibacterial agents for the treatment of MRSA NP include the glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and linezolid (available as an intravenous or oral treatment). Vancomycin has remained a standard of care in many European hospitals; however, there is evidence that it may be a suboptimal therapeutic option in critically ill patients with NP because of concerns about its limited intrapulmonary penetration, increased nephrotoxicity with higher doses, as well as the emergence of resistant strains that may result in increased clinical failure. Linezolid has demonstrated high penetration into the epithelial lining fluid of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and shown statistically superior clinical efficacy versus vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA NP in a phase IV, randomized, controlled study. This review focuses on the disease burden and clinical management of MRSA NP, and the use of linezolid after more than 10 years of clinical experience.

AB  - Abstract Infectious gill diseases of marine salmonid fish present a significant challenge in salmon-farming regions. Infectious syndromes or disease conditions affecting marine-farmed salmonids include amoebic gill disease (AGD), proliferative gill inflammation (PGI) and tenacibaculosis. Pathogens involved include parasites, such as Neoparamoeba perurans, bacteria, such as Piscichlamydia salmonis and Tenacibaculum maritimum, and viruses, such as the Atlantic salmon paramyxovirus (ASPV). The present level of understanding of these is reviewed with regard to risk factors, potential impacting factors, methods of best practice to mitigate infectious gill disease, as well as knowledge gaps and avenues for future research.

AB  - Abstract Bone repair after trauma or surgical intervention involves a tightly regulated cascade of events that starts with hemostasis and an inflammatory response, which are critical for successful healing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are routinely prescribed for pain relief despite their potential inhibitory effect on bone repair. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of administration of the non-selective NSAID diclofenac in the inflammatory phase of bone repair in mice with or without lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Repair of femoral window defects was characterized using micro computed tomography imaging and histological analyses at 2 weeks postoperative. The data indicate (a) impaired bone regeneration associated with reduced osteoblast, osteoclast, and macrophage activity; (b) changes in the number, activity, and distribution of mast cells in regenerating bone; and (c) impaired angiogenesis due to a direct toxic effect of diclofenac on vascular endothelial cells. The results of this study provide strong evidence to support the conjecture that administration of NSAIDs in the first 2 weeks after orthopaedic surgery disrupts the healing cascade and exacerbates the negative effects of systemic inflammation on the repair process.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral cephalexin given at 30 mg/kg once daily in dogs with superficial pyoderma and to compare them with those of oral cephalexin given at 15 mg/kg twice daily. Methods: Twenty dogs with superficial pyoderma were treated with cephalexin at 30 to 60 mg/kg orally once daily (group A) and compared with 20 dogs treated at a dose of 15 to 30 mg/kg orally twice daily (group B). Dogs were treated until 14 days after clinical remission. Type and distribution of lesions, pruritus and general health status were assessed every 14 days using a numerical scale until 14 days after treatment discontinuation. Total scores for each evaluation day were compared between the two groups as well as time to obtain resolution and percentage of relapses. Results: Resolution of superficial pyoderma was obtained in all dogs in 14 to 42 days (median 28 days for both groups), with no difference between groups. Six dogs experienced vomiting or diarrhoea but did not require discontinuation of the treatment. Only one dog (in group A) relapsed nine days after treatment discontinuation. Clinical Significance: Once-daily cephalexin is as effective as twice-daily cephalexin in the treatment of canine superficial pyoderma.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine those factors which are predictive of outcome in cases of thoracic empyema that are solely community acquired. All patients admitted with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in the Auckland region between 1993 and 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were determined at 3?6 month follow up. Radiological outcomes were scored on admission, discharge and follow up by blinded chest radiograph review based on lung field opacification, extent and thickness of pleura. Forty-six cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean age was 56 ± 21 years, 67% were male and there was no ethnic preponderance. Forty-six per cent of cases had specific underlying risk factors. Multi-loculated cases of empyema occurred in 63%, pleural aspirate was culture positive in 59% and Streptococcus milleri represented 42% of all positive cultures. Delay in appropriate management was 5.2 ± 4.2 days. Fifty-six per cent of total procedures incorporated intrapleural streptokinase as an adjunct to drainage. The cure rate was 93.3% without requirement for surgical intervention. Two patients died early giving a 4.3% mortality rate. Radiological scores were 8.6 ± 0.6 on admission, 6.3 ± 1.5 on discharge and 2.5 ± 2.5 at follow up. Improvement in radiological scores was statistically significant from admission to discharge and follow up (P<0.001). The total duration of hospitalization was 22 ± 10 days and by univariate analysis was predicted by: pleural sepsis not involving S. milleri (P = 0.001), specific predisposing factors (P = 0.02), and frank pus on pleural aspiration (P = 0.03). Total delay in management was suggestive in prolonging the duration of hospitalization (P = 0.07). Parapneumonic thoracic empyema is an important source of morbidity which is determined by both patient and management factors. Good results can be obtained by prompt medical therapy including tube drainage and intrapleural streptokinase without need for surgical intervention.

AB  - Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis are common inflammatory conditions of the canine central nervous system. Although each disease has unique histopathological features, these canine disorders collectively seem to be aberrant immune responses directed against the central nervous system. A review of the neurological signs and general neurodiagnostic approach to canine meningoencephalitis is followed by an overview of the specific clinical and neuropathological features of granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis. The aetiopathogenesis of each disorder is explored including potential genetic, immunological, and environmental factors along with the current and prospective immunomodulatory therapies for meningoencephalitis.
