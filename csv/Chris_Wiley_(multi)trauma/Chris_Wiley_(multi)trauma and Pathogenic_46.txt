Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -? Prion diseases ?? Future perspectives The stimuli for neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative disorders are multi-factorial and may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, cellular stressors such as oxidative stress and free radical production, bioenergy failure, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, disruption of Ca2+-regulating systems, mitochondrial dysfunction and misfolded protein accumulation. Cellular stress disrupts functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a critical organelle for protein quality control, leading to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress may contribute to neurodegeneration in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the molecular events occurring during ER stress and the unfolded protein response and it specifically evaluates the evidence suggesting the ER stress response plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Summary One of the roles of the personnel working in a clinic or hospital that frequently goes unsupported by veterinary technicians is in the surgical suite, not an anesthetist or a circulating nurse, but rather a surgical assistant for the surgeon. Once the patient is moved into the operating room, it is the responsibility of the surgical assistant to appropriately position the patient for the procedure to be done. Following patient positioning, the sterile prep and then draping may begin. Assistants must be thoroughly knowledgeable about the procedure and the approach the surgeon will use in order to effectively drape the patient. Another skill required of the surgical assistant is the knowledge of suture materials, suture patterns, and stapling devices that may be utilized during the procedure. In addition, the surgical assistant must be familiar with specific characteristics of each suture type, indications for use, patterns chosen by the surgeon and the stapling options available.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT The prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci infection in household, feral and farm cats in Britain was investigated. Chlamydia were isolated from 30 per cent of conjunctival swabs collected from 753 household cats with conjunctivitis. The prevalence of active chlamydial infection was highest in cats in the age group five weeks to nine months. Males were more frequently infected than females. Cats with chlamydial conjunctivitis usually had antibody titres greater than 1024 as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Chlamydia appeared to be endemic in two out of three feral cat colonies on the basis of serological evidence and occasional isolations. Cats on 10 of 22 sheep farms (45 per cent) had serological evidence of chlamydial infection, and this was confirmed on two farms by isolation of the organism from conjunctival and, or, rectal swabs. This is the first survey of infection with Chlamydia psittaci in cat populations in Britain.

AB  - Summary As the practice of canine rehabilitation and sports medicine continues to evolve, roles of practitioners are more specialized as approaches become more advanced. Clinical reasoning, care pathways, and specific applied interventions are adopted from the interprofessional practice of human sports medicine, requiring knowledge and understanding of the art and science of physical rehabilitation and related medical sciences. Contributing to a multifaceted team, the rehabilitation professional must be able to synthesize information related to the integrity and efficiency of the neuromusculoskeletal system, in coordination with other body systems, to affect the functional abilities of the patient. This is accomplished through the examination and evaluation of the patient with the purpose of identifying medical comorbidities, specific impairments, functional limitations, and disabilities. Understanding the interplay between the objective information collected during the rehabilitation examination and evaluation, patient-specific factors, and knowledge of basic sciences, physics, and biomechanics will guide the therapist in establishing a treatment plan that will ultimately contribute to the patient's return to an optimal level of function following injury, illness, or onset of a medical disorder or disease. The purpose of this introductory chapter is to: Define the practice of canine rehabilitation. Describe various contributions of the different members of the interprofessional canine rehabilitation team. Discuss the history and evolution of the practice of canine rehabilitation in the United States and internationally. Describe the practice of physical therapy as it pertains to the management of the canine rehabilitation patient. Discuss specific physiological considerations for the canine rehabilitation therapist when planning rehabilitation interventions. Describe patient management and treatment planning methods by which the canine rehabilitation therapist coordinates the implementation of treatment strategies and interventions.

AB  - Summary Early studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed key neurological features including the deposition of aggregates of insoluble ?-amyloid (A?) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and signs of chronic inflammation. The initial forms of these pathological hallmarks of the disease, including small oligomers of A? peptides and the hyperphosphorylated tau which aggregates into NFT, have been assumed to be part of ?the cause of AD? and have been specifically targeted to develop an effective monotherapy, but with limited success. In the absence of effective neuroprotective drugs, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have remained as the drug class that is most used to treat AD, yet they cannot and do not slow the progression of the disease. Imaging studies have confirmed what has long been suspected ? that there is a very long pre-clinical phase, when pathology gradually builds up, possibly starting with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated metabolism. Emerging therapies are targeted more towards these changes, sometimes as well as the A? and NFT pathologies in multi-targeted approaches, to interfere with the pathological cascades in AD. The aim is to prevent, stop, or at least slow the neurodegeneration before debilitating symptoms appear. This chapter summarises inflammatory and oxidative stress-related changes that occur in AD, and discusses some emerging therapies and supplements, particularly those directed at inflammation, that may slow pathogenesis of this complex neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disease which represents the most common form of dementia. Cognition impairment and memory loss are mostly caused by reduced levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, current drug therapies are based on the cholinergic hypothesis. However, ?-amyloid hypothesis is getting more important in last years. For many years, one of the basic drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was tacrine, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Unfortunately, it was withdrawn from the market due to its side effects. To diminish side effects, research has focused on obtaining multi-target-directed ligands, which target numerous disease pathways simultaneously, including those of Alzheimer's disease. The comprehensive review is focused on the outcomes of the studies of phyto-tacrine hybrids. Hybrids can inhibit cholinesterase and ?-amyloid aggregation. Additionally, phyto-hybrids have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective and metal chelating properties. Further research is necessary for the development of hybrids to find a proper therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Objectives: To characterise the distribution of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within the environment of a university small animal hospital and compare this with the distribution among staff. Methods: Samples were collected from 140 environmental sites and the anterior nares of 64 staff members at the University of Glasgow Small Animal Hospital on a single day (d1). Sixty of the environmental sites were resampled 14 days later (d14). Results: Meticillin-resistant S aureus was isolated from two of 140 (1·4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 1·7 to 5·1) environmental sites on d1 and one of 60 (1·7 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 0·4 to 8·9) on d14. Two of the 64 staff sampled were positive for meticillin-resistant S aureus (3·1 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval: 0·4 to 8·4). Clinical Significance: A lower prevalence of meticillin-resistant S aureus was observed in the environment than previously reported. The location, relatedness between isolates and the presence of Panton-Valentine leucocidin indicates that the source of the environmental meticillin-resistant S aureus was most likely to have been human rather than animal in these cases. This study presents important information regarding the potential source and distribution of meticillin-resistant S aureus within veterinary hospital environments and highlights potential variability of prevalence of meticillin-resistant S aureus within and between veterinary institutions.

AB  - Abstract Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most severe public health problem affecting both sexes but females are more susceptible due to the differences in urogenital and reproductive anatomy, physiology and lifestyle. As in UTI, different parts of the urinary tract are affected and morbidity due to UTI is more common in women of all ages and older men. Due to multi-drug resistant strains and high recurrence rate, UTI has become a major socioeconomic burden. The current review article was aimed to describe the natural therapeutic strategies to manage and cure the UTI. For this purpose, different databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane database, and PubMed etc. were explored. Inclusion criteria were any research article investigating the current therapy of UTI. It was found that microbial infections including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella species are the major causes of UTI with different signs and symptoms including painful urination or dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency, burning micturition, frequent urination, nausea, and vomiting. Antibiotics like trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, quinolone etc. as the first choice of the drug are used worldwide. However, due to microbial resistance, several life-threatening side effects, repeated high doses, high cost and low efficacy of these antibiotics motivated the researchers to explore natural remedies for the treatment of UTI. Herbal medicines are effective to combat bacterial resistance with high efficacy, and easy availability with minimal or no side effects. For these reasons it has attained the attention of researchers wanting to explore the herbal treatment of UTI. Vaccinium macrocarpon, Tribulus terrestris, Trachyspermum copticum, Cinnamomum verum and Hybanthusenn easpermus are some common medicinal plants reported to have therapeutic potential for the management and cure of the UTI. Although herbal medicines have more potential over conventional medicine but more discoveries are required to explore the phytoconstituents and their mechanism of action responsible for the management and cure of UTI.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

A novel genus, Tintelnotia is introduced containing two species, one of which caused an eye infection and several nail infections in humans. All species of Tintelnotia produce conidia in soft pycnidia with a wide ostiole. The generic type species is T. opuntiae causing necrotic spots on cactus plants. The isolates of the human opportunist T. destructans showed variable susceptibility pattern to a panel of common antifungal agents. The MICs of amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole were 1 ?g/mL, complemented by an in vitro MEC of 16 ?g/mL against caspofungin; the MIC of terbinafine was 0.125 ?g/mL. The latter compound contributed to the successful therapy in the ocular mycosis refractory to standard antifungal therapy, the benefit of terbinafine should be highlighted as a therapeutic option especially in difficult-to-treat fungal keratitis.

AB  - A 33-year-old African American woman presented with a 2 year history of skin lesions on her legs. Skin biopsy demonstrated interstitial and focally confluent reticular dermal histiocytic infiltrate consistent with granuloma annulare. She was treated with high-potency topical steroids and returned 14 months later with diffuse papular lesions, 80?lb. weight loss, and dyspnea. Repeat skin biopsy showed similar distribution of interstitial and sheet-like histiocytopathy, accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis, cell-poor lymphocytic interface dermatitis and thrombogenic vasculopathy. Stains for fungi (AB ? PAS and GMS) and mycobacterial species (Ziehl-Neelsen, Fite and auramine-rhodamine immunofluorescence) were negative. No foreign material was evident under polarized light. A diagnosis of cutaneous necrotizing sarcoidosis was made. Necrotizing sarcoidosis is a well-recognized pulmonary entity, but is rarely reported in the skin. Diagnostic features include granulomata with regional necrosis, often with a granulomatous vasculitis, in the absence of demonstrable microbial pathogens. Patients are typically adult women who present with pulmonary symptoms, fever, weight loss and fatigue. The etiology of sarcoidosis remains obscure. One proposed mechanism is an id reaction to an as yet unidentified pathogen, with circulating microbial antigens leading to an occlusive and infarctive vasculopathy. Such a mechanism could explain the pathologic changes seen with our patient.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of 80-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status. It discusses the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or syncope describes the geriatric patient who may be presenting with ACS. Geriatric patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) demonstrate improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus fibrinolytic treatment. The diagnosis of CHF in elderly patients presenting with dyspnea is often delayed due to atypical symptoms and multiple comorbidities. Beta-blockers are very effective for management of CHF in elderly patients, they are contraindicated in the presence of comorbid pulmonary disease and can cause symptomatic bradycardias and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction disorders. Rapid and aggressive therapy must be tempered by patient and family wishes regarding end-of-life care.
