AB  - Influenza is occasionally complicated by CNS disorders, in particular impairment of consciousness. Severe disorders encompass multiple, distinct syndromes manifesting acute encephalopathy, whereas mild disorders represent multiple, ill-defined neuropsychiatric syndromes. Acute encephalopathy is manifested with seizures and coma, with or without multi-organ involvement. The outcome varies from death or neurologic sequelae to recovery and differs among syndromes. Transient neuropsychiatric disorders are manifested with delirium and/or abnormal behavior. There also are multiple syndromes. The outcome is usually favorable, although occasional fatal accidents warrant caution.

AB  - Harmful algae (HA) and their toxins present increasing obstacles to routine protein production in aquatic systems. Preventing, controlling, or mitigating harmful algal blooms (HAB) and cyanobacterial HAB (cyanoHAB) have become major foci for many geographic areas and systems of the world, from freshwater ponds to openocean fish cages, problems potentially exacerbated with continued anthropogenic loading and a changing climate selecting for some bloom-forming taxa. Worldwide, aquaculture production of aquatic food in inland waters exceeds that of marine waters, but use of the sea for fish and shellfish mariculture is rapidly increasing in many coastal oceans. Multi-step linear food webs have also been used, with fish, shellfish, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and abalone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can test fish tissue for toxin content, generally in response to reported human illnesses or to identify whether newly identified toxins or other compounds might pose health risks to consumers.

AB  - Summary Lusitano horses were investigated in order to detect the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. vanA isolates showed high level vancomycin (Minimum inhibitory concentration; MIC ≥128?mg/l) and teicoplanin resistance (MIC 64?mg/l), as well as resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline. The tet(L) and erm(B) genes, associated with tetracycline and erythromycin resistance, respectively, were found in all vanA isolates. The intestinal tract of Lusitano horses can be a potential reservoir for vanA-containing enterococci.

AB  - Summary Sporotrichosis is a mycosis caused by fungi from the Sporothrix schenckii species complex, whose prototypical member is Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and shape the following adaptive immune response. A family of PRRs most frequently associated with fungal recognition is the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR). After PAMP recognition, NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) binds to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. When activated, this complex promotes the maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and IL-18 and cell death through pyroptosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the outcome of S. schenckii infection using the following three different knockout (KO) mice: NLRP3?/?, ASC?/? and caspase-1?/?. All KO mice were more susceptible to infection than the wild-type, suggesting that NLRP3-triggered responses contribute to host protection during S. schenckii infection. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome appeared to be critical for the ex vivo release of IL-1?, IL-18 and IL-17 but not interferon-?. Additionally, a role for the inflammasome in shaping the adaptive immune response was suggested by the lower frequencies of type 17 helper T (Th17) cells and Th1/Th17 but not Th1 cells in S. schenckii-infected KO mice. Overall, our results indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome links the innate recognition of S. schenckii to the adaptive immune response, so contributing to protection against this infection.

AB  - Summary There are several differences in treatment of neonatal foals with antimicrobials, compared to mature horses. Firstly, the dose of many antimicrobials is different in the foal. For orally administered drugs, this may also affect their efficacy, due to different enteral absorption. Secondly, neonatal foals are not yet hindgut fermentors and this allows antimicrobials with a high propensity to cause colitis in mature horses to be used. Thirdly, toxicities are different and some antimicrobials used in mature horses, such as enrofloxacin, are not suitable for use in foals. Foal-specific information is therefore needed for their safe and effective treatment with antimicrobials.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - Aim: To determine the occurrence of educational, behavioural and general health problems in Dutch school-age survivors of bacterial meningitis. Methods: A cohort of 680 school-age survivors of meningitis caused by the most common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was established approximately 6 y after the children's illness. Children with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis were excluded because this form of the disease has virtually disappeared. Parents completed questionnaires on educational, behavioural and general health problems. The reference group comprised 304 school-age siblings and peers. Results: Postmeningitic children were more likely than controls to under achieve at school: 20% vs 5% (odds ratio 5.6; 95% confidence interval 3.0?10.7). The postmeningitic children repeated a year twice as often as the children in the reference group (16% vs 8%, odds ratio: 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.5?4.2) and were referred to a special-needs school four times more frequently (8% vs 2%, odds ratio: 5.5; 95% confidence interval 2.0?15.4). Parents also reported more behavioural problems at home. More than half of the postmeningitic children experienced general health problems. The causative pathogen or age at infection had no influence on the relative frequency of educational and behavioural problems, and reduced auditory functioning played only a small part in these problems. Conclusion: Parents perceive educational, behavioural and general health problems in more than 30% of postmeningitic children. Until it is clear which children are at highest risk of developing these problems, it will be necessary to follow postmeningitic children into their school-age years.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse the association between time from triage to administration of initial antibiotics and mortality in all patients presenting with sepsis to a tertiary hospital ED. Methods A retrospective review of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis from January to December 2012 was conducted at Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia. Outcome measures were: time elapsed from triage to administration of initial antibiotic therapy and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 220 patients presented with sepsis, comprising 102 cases of uncomplicated sepsis and 118 severe sepsis. The median time to antibiotic administration was 3.5?h (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7?6.6) and in-hospital mortality was 28.6% (95% CI 22.6?34.6%). There was no association observed between delays to antibiotics and mortality in the total patient population. When stratified by presenting severity, patients with severe sepsis demonstrated a trend towards increased mortality when delays to antibiotics exceeded 6 h from triage (HR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.91?5.59, P = 0.08) in comparison with <1?h. Significant delays to antibiotic administration occurred when initial agents were charted as a ?regular medicine? (9.4?h, IQR 5.1?16.6) in comparison with a ?once only order? (3.4?h, IQR 1.7?6.7), P < 0.001. Conclusions Early administration of antibiotics specifically in patients with severe sepsis might be beneficial. Further studies within the ED are warranted to establish the effect of delayed antibiotics in a generalised sepsis cohort.

AB  - Summary Background Podoconiosis affects an estimated 3 million people in Ethiopia with a further 19 million at risk. Volcanic soil and pathogens enter skin breaches in the feet causing inflammation, lymphoedema and hyperkeratosis. There is no robust evidence on optimal podoconiosis skincare regimens to improve skin barrier function (SBF). Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of a new, low-cost, evidence-based intervention to improve SBF in the lower limbs of those with podoconiosis. Methods A randomized controlled trial (NCT02839772) was conducted over 3 months in two podoconiosis clinics (n = 193). The intervention comprised 2% (v/v) glycerine added to a reduced volume of soaking water. The control group received the current skincare regimen. Primary outcome measures were transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at four specific sites on the lower limbs. Results Improvement in SBF was observed in both groups across all measurement sites and time points, although this was significantly greater in the experimental group. TEWL reduced in both groups at all sites. For example, on top of the foot the estimated group difference in TEWL at visit 4 was 1·751 [standard error (SE) = 0·0390] in favour of the experimental group [t = 3·15, degrees of freedom (df) = 189·58, P = 0·002, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·066?2·85], indicating a greater reduction in TEWL in the experimental group. Similarly, at the same site the estimated group difference in SCH at visit 4 was ?2·041 (SE = 0·572) in favour of the experimental group (t = ?3·56, df = 186·74, P < 0·001, 95% CI ?3·16 to ?0·91), indicating a greater increase in SCH in the experimental group. There were also significantly greater reductions in odour, number of wounds and largest foot circumference in the experimental vs. the control group. Conclusions The addition of 2% (v/v) glycerol to a reduced volume (83% reduction) of soaking water significantly improved SBF.

AB  - Summary Fungal endometritis is a relatively rare cause of infertility in the mare, accounting for only 1?5% of all cases of endometritis. However, it remains a challenge to the clinician due to difficulties in diagnosing and effectively treating affected mares, resulting in a high rate of recurrence and a guarded prognosis for ongoing fertility. Often occurring as an opportunistic infection, the most common causes of fungal endometritis in the mare are yeasts (Candida spp.) and moulds with septated hyphae (Aspergillus spp.). Early detection and identification of the causative agent are vital when choosing appropriate treatment as sensitivities to commonly used antifungals vary significantly. Assessing in vitro sensitivity for each isolate is accordingly recommended. Treatment of mares with fungal endometritis is multifaceted and includes; correction of any anatomical defects, uterine lavage and systemic and/or intrauterine infusion of antifungals. Concurrent bacterial infection is common so anticipation and subsequent treatment of bacterial endometritis is also often required.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - ABSTRACT A distinct type of liver disease is described in 21 cats. It is characterized morphologically by monolobular fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates which surround and permeate bile ducts and proliferation of bile ductules of varying intensity. The most common clinical signs are ascites, jaundice and hypergammaglobulinaemia. The condition appears to progress through an active stage of intense lymphocytic infiltration and proliferation of bile ductules to a stage of progressive monolobular fibrosis which results in distortion of liver architecture. The rate of progression is very variable. The condition differs from that of ascending or suppurative cholangitis described in the cat and bears only superficial resemblances to various forms of cholangitis in man and other species. At present the aetiology is unknown but it is suggested that genetic and immunological factors may predispose certain animals to produce hepatic lesions after exposure to a variety of environmental factors.

AB  - Abstract Skin and soft-tissue infections are a common presentation to EDs in Australasia. In the absence of sepsis or decreased oral absorption, substantial supportive data exists that shows oral antibiotics are non-inferior to intravenous antibiotics for uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infections. However, despite a fair evidence base, clinicians are not consistently putting this into practice. This perspective reviews the relevant literature, discusses barriers to the implementation of this more parsimonious approach and also proposes several potential solutions. It is important that ED clinicians are encouraged to use oral antibiotics for uncomplicated infections, as this would lead to similar clinical outcomes but with fewer resources for staff and patient, as well as increased patient satisfaction.

AB  - Summary: The T-helper 17 (Th17) lineage is a recently described subset of memory T cells that is characterized by its CD4+ status and its ability to make a constellation of cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. Although most extensively described in the autoimmunity literature, there is growing evidence that the Th17 lineage plays a significant role in mediating host mucosal immunity to a number of pulmonary pathogens. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of the Th17 lineage and Th17 cytokines in mediating mucosal immunity to both pulmonary and gastrointestinal pathogens. While we have the strongest evidence that the Th17 lineage is centrally involved in mediating the host response to Gram-negative extracellular pulmonary pathogens, this literature is rapidly evolving and demonstrates a central role for Th17 cytokines both in primary infection and in recall responses seen in vaccine studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of this literature and present possible applications of Th17-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infection.

AB  - Summary Bacterial diseases of poultry tend to cause significant losses to the poultry industry worldwide annually. This chapter focuses on some of the sporadic bacterial diseases. The less common pathogens included in this chapter are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Erysipelas, spirochetes, and tuberculosis. The section on enterococci and its association with disease is included with the streptococci. These organisms have an increased influence in poultry production due to their ability to cause local and systemic disease and in light of the limited use of growth promoters. The chapter also includes a section devoted to miscellaneous organisms that have caused disease in poultry or are a public health concern. Bacterial culture is required for diagnosis, as clinical signs and gross lesions of acute enterococcal infections overlap with other bacterial diseases of chickens. Prevention and control require reducing stress and preventing immunosuppressive diseases and conditions. Proper cleaning and disinfection can reduce environmental enterococcal resident flora to minimize external exposure.
