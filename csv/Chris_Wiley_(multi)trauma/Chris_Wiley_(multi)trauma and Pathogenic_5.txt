AB  - Background and objectives:? Surveillance cultures may improve the prediction of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and empirical antibiotic selection. This study examined the utility and patient safety of blind, non-protected, low-volume mini-bronchial lavage (BM-BAL) surveillance cultures in predicting VAP. Methodology:? A prospective, cohort study was performed in a large general intensive care unit. BM-BALs were collected within 12?h of admission then thrice weekly. Each BM-BAL was screened by Gram staining for intracellular organisms and then quantitatively cultured. VAP was diagnosed using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score. The concordance for isolates from the BM-BAL was assessed against concurrently collected endotracheal aspirates (EA). Results:? Four hundred and twelve patients requiring a minimum of 48?h of mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Fifty patients developed 58 episodes of VAP. Concordant pathogens were found in 85% of BM-BAL specimens collected 2?days prior to VAP onset. Their antibiograms were stable over the preceding 4?days. The isolation of pathogens with colony counts ≥104?cfu/mL from BM-BAL performed 2?days prior to the clinical onset of VAP had a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 50%, positive predictive value of 31% and a negative predictive value of 93% for predicting the development of VAP. BM-BAL WCC, quantification of bacterial growth and the percentage of intracellular organisms were not helpful in predicting VAP diagnosis. Conclusions:? BM-BAL surveillance cultures are well tolerated and useful in predicting the pathogens and their antibiograms causing VAP. Diagnostic specimen collection at the time of VAP onset is still required as surveillance cultures may be negative even one day prior to VAP onset.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract Any discussion of the regulation of effector class must include feedback control on the magnitude of the response. The induced effector activities are biodestructive and ridding. They are, in and of themselves, unspecific with respect to self and nonself. Consequently all responses include some level of innocent bystander pathology. The regulation of magnitude is essential to keeping this level of pathology at an evolutionarily acceptable level. This is my postulated role of suppressor T-cells, more popularly referred to as Treg. In order to perform this function they must be somatically selected to be anti-nonself like all other T/B-cells. If correct, any role that they might play in determining normal tolerance is excluded. As the commentary of Ellestad illustrates, their function to regulate autoimmunity is the consensus view today and, therefore, this competing concept and my analysis of suggested papers should invite a wide ranging debate.

AB  - Objectives To assess the prevalence of canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 2, canine distemper virus, canine respiratory coronavirus and influenza virus A infections in: (1) privately-owned or, (2) kennelled dogs showing signs consistent with canine infectious respiratory disease and, (3) clinically healthy dogs in Vienna, Austria. Materials and Methods Prospectively, nasal and tonsillar swabs from 214 dogs affected with infectious respiratory disease, and 50 healthy control dogs were tested for nucleic acids specific to the various viral infections. Concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 31 dogs with chronic respiratory disease was investigated for the same viral pathogens. Additionally, anti-canine respiratory coronavirus antibody concentrations were measured in paired blood samples from 30 acutely diseased dogs. Results Canine respiratory coronavirus (7.5%) and canine parainfluenza virus (6.5%) were the most commonly detected viruses in samples from the upper airways of dogs with respiratory infections. Serological results showed a significant seroconversion in response to coronavirus in 50% of the examined cases. None of the samples was positive for influenza virus A-specific nucleic acid. Canine coronavirus-specific nucleic acid was detected in 4.0% of healthy dogs. Clinical Significance Canine coronavirus should be considered as a clinically relevant cause of infectious respiratory disease in crowded dog populations. For sample collection, the nasal mucosa can be recommended as the favoured site. Analysis of paired serum samples aids verification of canine coronavirus infection in respiratory disease.

AB  - Abstract. Periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. This has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. These studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. Significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: The experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-Infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. It was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epitelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. Extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

Conclusions and outlook?670 ?Acknowledgements?671 ?References?671 Summary Insects select their hosts, but trees cannot select which herbivores will feed upon them. Thus, as long-lived stationary organisms, conifers must resist the onslaught of varying and multiple attackers over their lifetime. Arguably, the greatest threats to conifers are herbivorous insects and their associated pathogens. Insects such as bark beetles, stem- and wood-boring insects, shoot-feeding weevils, and foliage-feeding budworms and sawflies are among the most devastating pests of conifer forests. Conifer trees produce a great diversity of compounds, such as an enormous array of terpenoids and phenolics, that may impart resistance to a variety of herbivores and microorganisms. Insects have evolved to specialize in resistance to these chemicals ? choosing, feeding upon, and colonizing hosts they perceive to be best suited to reproduction. This review focuses on the plant?insect interactions mediated by conifer-produced terpenoids. To understand the role of terpenoids in conifer?insect interactions, we must understand how conifers produce the wide diversity of terpenoids, as well as understand how these specific compounds affect insect behaviour and physiology. This review examines what chemicals are produced, the genes and proteins involved in their biosynthesis, how they work, and how they are regulated. It also examines how insects and their associated pathogens interact with, elicit, and are affected by conifer-produced terpenoids.

AB  - Acute bacterial infection of the central nervous system requires rapid and adequate management. Etiological diagnosis is hence crucial. Moreover, the epidemic threat of certain bacteria necessitates a reliable characterization of the involved bacterial strains to follow the spread of epidemic strains. Conventional identification and characterization of etiological agents are basically based on culture and identification of bacterial markers most frequently by serological assays. Molecular identification and characterization of bacteria have been employed. They provide more reliable analysis of bacterial isolates. Molecular methods for non-culture diagnosis of bacterial infections have recently been developed. In many cases, the molecular assays have decreased the identification time of positive cultures and rescued detection of pathogens in culture-negative clinical samples.

AB  - Summary Background Colletotrichum is a rare cause of human infection. Previous reports about Colletotrichum keratitis were limited, and most diagnoses from past reports were based on morphological distinction, which could have led to underestimation of the prevalence of Colletotrichum species. Objective We reported phylogenetic analysis, clinical feature and treatment outcome of molecularly diagnosed Colletotrichum keratitis in our hospital. Patients/Methods We recruited 65 patients with culture-proven filamentous fungal keratitis between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. Through molecular sequencing including internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of fungal DNA, seven patients were verified as infected with Colletotrichum species, and their medical records were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics. Results Six of seven patients had predisposing factors including trauma (5) and immunosuppressive status (1). Six isolates were initially misidentified as other fungi through morphological identification. ITS sequencing identified the isolates belonged to two species complex (SC): C. truncatum and C. gloeosporioides; multi-locus phylogenetic analysis enabled species identification including C. tropicale (3), C. fructicola (2), C. truncatum (1) and C. fusiforme (1). Five patients with C. gloeosporioides SC responded well to medical treatment and two patients with C truncatum SC underwent evisceration because of either no visual potential or intractable pain. Conclusions The molecular approach provides accurate diagnosis and raises epidemiological awareness of Colletotrichum keratitis. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, we report the human infections caused by C. tropicale, C. fructicola and C. fusiforme. We also highlight the different clinical outcomes between C. gloeosporioides SC and C. truncatum SC.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic experiences. We propose a socio-interpersonal model of PTSD that complements existing models of post-traumatic memory processes or neurobiological changes. The model adds an interpersonal perspective to explain responses to traumatic stress. The framework draws from lifespan psychology, cultural psychology and research into close relationships and groups. Additionally, clinical knowledge about PTSD is incorporated. This involves knowledge about shame, guilt, estrangement feelings and protective factors, such as social support and forgiveness. Three levels are proposed at which relevant interpersonal processes can be situated and should be adequately researched. First, the individual level comprises social affective states, such as shame, guilt, anger and feelings of revenge. Second, at the close relationship level, social support, negative exchange (ostracism and blaming the victim), disclosure and empathy are proposed as dyadic processes relevant to PTSD research and treatment. Third, the distant social level represents culture and society, in which the collectivistic nature of trauma, perceived injustice, and social acknowledgement are concepts that predict the response trajectories to traumatic stress. Research by the current authors and others is cited in an effort to promote future investigation based on the current model. Methodological implications, such as multi-level data analyses, and clinical implications, such as the need for couple, community or larger-level societal interventions, are both outlined. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The socio-interpersonal model proposes an interpersonal view of the processes that occur in the aftermath of a traumatic experience. At the individual level, the model integrates the social affective phenomena that clinical research identifies in PTSD patients, including shame, guilt, anger, revenge and the urges or reluctance to disclose. At the level of close relationships, there is an emphasis on the role of the individuals' partner, family or social support in the development or maintenance of PTSD and its recovery. At the distant social level, societal and cultural factors, e.g., individualistic versus collectivistic or other human value orientations, are acknowledged as contributing to the severity and course of PTSD. Increasing attention should be given to new approaches of PTSD treatment that refer to an interpersonal view of PTSD, e.g., communication training, PTSD-specific couples' therapy or community programs.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/δ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naïve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Volumetric muscle loss (VML) occurs following significant traumatic injury or surgical removal of skeletal muscle, resulting in nonrecoverable loss of tissue and long-term dysfunction. Perhaps less recognized is that VML injuries inherently disrupt the neuromuscular unit, resulting in fiber denervation and presumptive motor unit rearrangement, expansion, and/or loss. To characterize neural dysfunction we quantified motoneuron axotomy, in efforts to understand how this relates to the temporal coordination of neuromuscular and morphological alterations due to injury. Methods In an established rat tibialis anterior (TA) VML injury model, we examined the motoneuron, skeletal muscle, and maximal isometric torque at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days postinjury. Results Significant axotomy of 57?79% of all TA muscle motoneurons was observed through 21 days postinjury, which was coupled with a 45?90% TA maximal torque deficit. Discussion A ?20% partial ablation of the TA muscle causes disproportionate damage across the motor unit acutely postinjury. Muscle Nerve 57: 799?807, 2018

AB  - Abstract:? Traumatic experiences of violence like those that were brought about by the communist regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) are still present as if they happened yesterday, causing severe disadvantages in everyday life even after all those years. Consequently, in cases of extreme traumatization induced by political imprisonment, persecution and applied psychological methods of disintegration, regressive processes take place which corrode the ego. The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the failure of empathic connection at the time of the trauma, is the strongest characteristic of severe traumatization. As a result of this destruction for the traumatized there is an inability to keep upright an inner empathic, emotional connection. As we try to grasp, from a Jungian point of view, the psychodynamics of severe traumatization, we can speak of a powerful pathogenous complex, which I call the ?Prometheus-complex?. Gustav Bovensiepen speaks of this complex as a sub-network, a limited fragment of the matrix of all internalized experiences, consisting of internal working models, feelings and patterns of anticipation which interact mutually. The human being, captured in such isolation and paralysis of the mind, can find himself ?in the therapist? on a mental level.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the ecology, pathogenicity, virulence, detection, prevention and control of Vibrio vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae. The ecology of V. vulnificus in seawater is markedly affected by temperature and salinity. The role of phage in the ecology of V. vulnificus remains poorly defined but has been proposed as a potential remedial method to reduce V. vulnificus and target pathogenic strains in post-harvest shellfish. PCR and gene probe methods are available as confirmatory tests for V. vulnificus. When these phenotypic methods are used, V. vulnificus can be differentiated from non-Vibrio using TSI, KIA, and arginine glucose slants, oxidation- fermentation and oxidase tests, and various other methods. The US food and drug administration (FDA) produced a risk assessment that is used to control growth of V. vulnificus through post-harvest time?temperature control.

AB  - Summary The purpose of this prospective study was to enumerate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)+ cells and measure their function using synthetic oligonucleotides enriched in CG dinucleotide motifs (CpG)-induced proliferation within 48?h after trauma in severely injured patients prone to sepsis. Sixteen consecutive trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS)?>?21 and 16 blood donors (controls) were included in this study. Using two-colour flow cytometry, TLR9 expression was detectable intracellularly and also on the surface of B lymphocytes. The surface expression of TLR9 of B lymphocytes from whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with CpG was significantly increased in B cells of severely injured patients prone to sepsis compared to controls. No significant differences could be observed between CpG-induced proliferation of PBMC of severely injured patients prone to sepsis and controls. As a measure of immunosuppression, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression of monocytes of the trauma patients was significantly diminished compared with controls in PBMC and in whole blood. Immunosuppression in the early phase after trauma seems not to be associated with a disturbed sensing of bacterial DNA.

AB  - Summary Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are rarely due to fungal agents and if so they are mainly caused by Candida strains. This case represents a PJI caused by a multi-drug resistant Pseudallescheria apiosperma, with poor in vivo response to itraconazole and voriconazole. This case differs also by the way of infection, since the joint infection did not follow a penetrating trauma. In the majority of cases, Scedosporium extremity infections remain local in immunocompetent individuals. We report a persistent joint infection with multiple therapeutic failures, and subsequent amputation of the left leg. Detailed clinical data, patient history, treatment regime and outcome of a very long-lasting (>4?years) P. apiosperma prosthetic knee infection in an immunocompetent, 61-year-old male patient are presented with this case. The patient was finally cured by the combination of multiple and extensive surgical interventions and prolonged antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to form biofilm on the surface of implanted devices is often considered the most critical virulence factor possessed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in its role as an opportunistic pathogen in orthopaedic device-related infection (ODRI). Despite this recognition, there is a lack of clinical evidence linking outcome with biofilm forming ability for S. epidermidis ODRIs. We prospectively collected S. epidermidis isolates cultured from patients presenting with ODRI. Antibiotic resistance patterns and biofilm-forming ability was assessed. Patient information was collected and treatment outcome measures were determined after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. The primary outcome measure was cure at follow-up. Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on treatment outcome. A total of 124 patients were included in the study, a majority of whom (n?=?90) involved infections of the lower extremity. A clear trend emerged in the lower extremity cohort whereby cure rates decreased as the biofilm-forming ability of the isolates increased (84% cure rate for infections caused by non-biofilm formers, 76% cure rate for weak biofilm-formers, and 60% cure rate for the most marked biofilm formers, p?=?0.076). Antibiotic resistance did not influence treatment cure rate. Chronic immunosuppression was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cure rate (p?=?0.044). Clinical significance: The trend of increasing biofilm-forming ability resulting in lower cure rates for S. epidermidis ODRI indicates biofilm-forming ability of infecting pathogens does influence treatment outcome of infections of the lower extremity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.
