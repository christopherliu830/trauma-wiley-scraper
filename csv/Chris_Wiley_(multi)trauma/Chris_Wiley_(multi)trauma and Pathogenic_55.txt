AB  - Reasons for performing study Little data on BALF cytokine profiles are available from racehorses with IAD; cytological diagnosis being most frequently made from one lung only per horse. Objectives To compare cytokine mRNA expressions and protein concentrations in BALF from both lungs of horses with unilateral IAD-consistent cytology. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods As part of a larger study, 250?ml saline was randomly instilled in one lung and 500?ml in the contralateral lung of 30 clinically healthy Standardbred racehorses. This procedure was repeated 72?h later, inversing the volume per lung. Cytological cut-off values for IAD diagnosis was neutrophil proportions >10% when instilling 250?ml. For these samples, mRNA expression and concentrations of IL-1?, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-? were determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Results Eleven horses had BALF with IAD- and CTL-consistent cytology from, respectively, each lung, and were enrolled in the study (22 samples). Data were not significantly influenced by the sampling day, and BALF total cell counts or cytokine concentrations were not significantly different among lungs. Relative mRNA expression of IL-1? (3.887?±?3.082; P?=?0.01) and IL-10 (3.225?±?1.710; P?=?0.005) were significantly higher in BALF of IAD- compared to CTL consistent lungs (respectively 1.408?±?1.118 and 1.488?±?1.393); and also correlated to neutrophil proportions (respectively r?=?0.54; P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.65; P?=?0.001). Conclusions Differences in cytokine mRNA expression were associated with IAD- or CTL consistent BALF cytology in the same racehorses in training. These findings suggest that specific local immune reactions or regulation within the lower airways should be considered in IAD. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Regional Animal Ethic Committee, and informed consent was provided by all horse owners. Sources of funding:?LABÉO, CISCO-Oniris and AVEF (French Association of Equine Practitioners). Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004). Source of funding:?Adelle Bowden's studentship is funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - The dog is a definitive host of the protozoan parasite Neospora caninum, and in many parts of the world, infection is relatively common as determined by serology. Reported seroprevalences usually range from 0 to 20 per cent, however, reports of clinically affected dogs are infrequent. Affected dogs are generally less than six months old and predominantly have signs of an ascending hindleg paralysis, with the associated lesions of polyradiculoneuritis and granulomatous polymyositis. Although any organ may be affected, infections are more common in the central nervous system, muscles, lungs and skin. Ante-mortem diagnosis is difficult but serology and cytology can aid diagnosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by histology, immunohistochemistry, the use of molecular techniques on biopsy material, or on post-mortem examination. Neospora caninum oocysts are rarely found in faeces and must be differentiated from oocysts of related coccidians such as Hammondia heydorni and Toxoplasma gondii. Hammondia heydorni can cause diarrrhoea in immunosuppressed dogs. Neosporosis should be suspected in young pups with an ascending paralysis of the hindlegs. Treatment with clindamycin and potentiated sulphonamides may be useful in cases where muscular atrophy and fibrosis are absent. Feeding of raw meat is a potential risk factor for infection of dogs and should be discouraged.

AB  - Abstract Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic relapsing pruritic skin disease of dogs for which treatment has varied over time and geographical location. Recent high quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have established which drugs are likely to offer consistent benefit. The International Task Force for Canine AD currently recommends a multi-faceted approach to treat dogs with AD. Acute flares should be treated with a combination of nonirritating baths and topical glucocorticoids, once an attempt has been made to identify and remove the suspected causes of the flare. Oral glucocorticoids and antimicrobial therapy must be added when needed. In dogs with chronic AD, a combination of interventions should be considered. Again, factors that trigger flares of AD must be identified and, if possible, avoided. Currently recognized flare factors include food, flea and environmental allergens, Staphylococcus bacteria and Malassezia yeast. Skin and coat hygiene and care must be improved by bathing with nonirritating shampoos and dietary supplementation with essential fatty acids. The severity of pruritus and skin lesions can be reduced with a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs. Currently, medications with good evidence of high efficacy include topical and oral glucocorticoids, and calcineurin inhibitors such as oral ciclosporin and topical tacrolimus. The dose and frequency of administration of these drugs should be tailored to each patient considering each drug?s efficacy, adverse effects and cost. Allergen-specific immunotherapy should be offered, whenever feasible, in an attempt to prevent recurrence of clinical signs upon further exposure to environmental allergens to which the patient is hypersensitive.

AB  - Abstract Background: This was a phase IV, multicenter, open-label, 12?14-month study to assess clinical recurrence in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who received maintenance treatment with MMX Multi Matrix System (MMX) mesalamine. A secondary outcome was the relationship between long-term efficacy and adherence. Methods: Patients with quiescent UC (no rectal bleeding; 0?1 bowel movements more than normal per day) were enrolled directly into a 12-month maintenance phase of the study during which they received MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day given once daily (QD). Patients with active, mild-to-moderate UC at screening were enrolled into a 2-month acute phase; those who achieved quiescence could continue into the maintenance phase. The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence at Month 6. Results: Of the 290 patients enrolled, 208 entered the maintenance phase; 152 directly and 56 via the acute phase. Following 6 and 12 months of treatment, 76.5% and 64.4% of evaluable patients, respectively, were recurrence-free. The majority of evaluable patients at Month 6 (81.6%) and Month 12 (79.4%) in the maintenance phase were ≥80% adherent to MMX mesalamine. At Month 6, clinical recurrence was observed in 20.6% of patients who were ≥80% adherent and 36.1% of patients with <80% adherence (P = 0.05 [post-hoc chi-square analysis]); 31.2% and 52.5% at Month 12 (P = 0.01 [post-hoc chi-square analysis]). Conclusions: MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day QD is effective for maintaining quiescence in patients with UC. Furthermore, adherence to prescribed treatment yielded lower rates of clinical recurrence. Continued education regarding the importance of long-term 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy is warranted. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2012;)

AB  - Abstract Objective To test whether partial pressure of CO2 in expired gas (P?CO2) predicts the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2) in apneic chickens during air sac insufflation anesthesia at three different ventilation states. Secondary objective: To determine the P?CO2 at which apnea occurs during air sac insufflation anesthesia. Study design Randomized cross-over study. Animals Twenty-three healthy male white leghorn chickens. Methods Chickens were anesthetized via mask with isoflurane in oxygen and an air sac cannula was placed in the right abdominal air sac. Delivery of isoflurane in O2 was transferred from the mask to the air sac cannula. The birds were maintained at a surgical plane of anesthesia and apnea was induced by adjusting gas flow; the P?CO2 at apnea was recorded. The birds were then paralyzed and gas flow was adjusted to achieve three different P?CO2s in random order: 43 mmHg (5.6 kPa) [hypoventilation]; 33 mmHg (4.3 kPa) [normoventilation]; and 23 mmHg (3.0 kPa) [hyperventilation]. After maintaining the target expired isoflurane concentration (EIso; 1.85 or 1.90%) and P?CO2 for 15 minutes, arterial blood gas analysis was performed to determine the PaCO2. The chickens were euthanized at the end of the experiment. Results Based on Bland-Altman comparisons, P?CO2 was not strongly associated with PaCO2 during the three ventilation states. The P?CO2 at which apnea occurred varied {median (minimum, maximum): 35 (30, 48) mmHg [4.6 (3.9, 6.2) kPa]}. Conclusions Measured P?CO2 cannot be used in a simple linear fashion to predict PaCO2 in birds during air sac insufflation anesthesia. The P?CO2 at which apnea occurs during air sac insufflation anesthesia is not predictable. Clinical relevance Arterial blood gases should be used to monitor CO2 during air sac insufflation anesthesia to verify appropriate patient ventilation.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract Clinical diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and clinching molecular evidence to substantiate the diagnosis. This is more so in populations with low prevalence of these disorders. In this report, we describe the case of a young man from India with recurrent fever and persistent arthritis. The patient's forefathers were of Egyptian ancestry who practiced consanguinity. Molecular genetic analysis using whole-exome sequencing suggested the presence of variants c.443A>T:p.E148V and c.442G>C:p.E148Q in the MEFV gene, earlier independently shown to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in a compound heterozygous state. The variants were further confirmed by capillary sequencing. This report also highlights the application of whole exome sequencing to delineate the allelic differences in the variants apart from serving as a quick genetic screening approach for autoinflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a compound heterozygosity for the two well-characterized variants associated with atypical FMF in a patient.

AB  - Disease and other health hazards pose serious threats to the persistence of wild ape populations. The total chimpanzee population at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, has declined from an estimated 120 to 150 individuals in the 1960's to around 100 individuals by the end of 2013, with death associated with observable signs of disease as the leading cause of mortality. In 2004, we began a non-invasive health-monitoring program in the two habituated communities in the park (Kasekela and Mitumba) with the aim of understanding the prevalence of health issues in the population, and identifying the presence and impacts of various pathogens. Here we present prospectively collected data on clinical signs (observable changes in health) in the chimpanzees of the Kasekela (n?=?81) and Mitumba (n?=?32) communities over an 8-year period (2005?2012). First, we take a population approach and analyze prevalence of clinical signs in five different categories: gastrointestinal system (diarrhea), body condition (estimated weight loss), respiratory system (coughing, sneezing etc.), wounds/lameness, and dermatologic issues by year, month, and community membership. Mean monthly prevalence of each clinical sign per community varied, but typically affected <10% of observed individuals. Secondly, we analyze the presence of clinical signs in these categories as they relate to individual demographic and social factors (age, sex, and dominance rank) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) infection status. Adults have higher odds of being observed with diarrhea, loss of body condition, and wounds or lameness when compared to immatures, while males have a higher probability of being observed with wounds or lameness than females. In contrast, signs of respiratory illness appear not to be related to chimpanzee-specific factors and skin abnormalities are very rare. For a subset of known-rank individuals, dominance rank predicts the probability of wounding/lameness in adult males, but does not predict any adverse clinical signs in adult females. Instead, adult females with SIVcpz infection are more likely to be observed with diarrhea, a finding that warrants further investigation. Comparable data are needed from other sites to determine whether the prevalence of clinical signs we observe are relatively high or low, as well as to more fully understand the factors influencing health of wild apes at both the population and individual level.

AB  - Summary Aims To better inform medical practitioners on the role of antiseptics in oropharyngeal health and disease, this article focuses on povidone-iodine (PVP-I), an established and widely-available antiseptic agent. Methodology Review of the anti-infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP-I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo-pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). Results Antiseptics with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence-base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. Conclusion The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large-scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Danofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone developed for veterinary medicine showing an excellent activity. However, danofloxacin pharmacokinetics profile have not been studied in horses previously. Objective: To study the pharmacokinetics following i.v., i.m. and intragastric (i.g.) administration of 1.25 mg/kg bwt danofloxacin to 6 healthy horses. Methods: A cross-over design was used in 3 phases (2 times 2 ? 2), with 2 washout periods of 15 days (n = 6). Danofloxacin (18%) was administered by i.v. and i.m. routes at single doses of 1.25 mg/kg bwt. For i.g. administration an oral solution was prepared and administered via nasogastric tube. Danofloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Tolerability at the the site of i.m. injection was monitored by creatine kinase (CK) activity. Results: Danofloxacin plasma concentration vs. time data after i.v. and i.g. administration could best be described by a 2-compartment open model. The disposition of i.m. administered danofloxacin was best described by a one-compartment model. The terminal half-lives for i.v., i.m. and i.g. routes were 6.31, 5.36 and 4.74 h, respectively. Clearance value after i.v. dosing was 0.34 l/kg bwt/h. After i.m. administration, absolute bioavailability was mean ± s.d. 88.48 ± 11.10% and Cmax was 0.35 ± 0.05 mg/l. After i.g. administration, absolute bioavailability was 22.36 ± 6.84% and Cmax 0.21 ± 0.07 mg/l. CK activity following i.m. dosing increased 3-fold over pre-injection levels 12 h after dosing and subsequently approached (but did not reach) normal values at 72 h post dose. Conclusions: Systemic danofloxacin exposure achieved in horses following i.m. administration was consistent with the predicted blood levels needed for a positive therapeutic outcome for many equine infections. Conversely, danofloxacin utility by the i.g. route was limited by low bioavailability. Tolerability associated with i.m. administration was high. Potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics, blood levels and good tolerability of i.v. and i.m. administration of danofloxacin in horses indicates that it is likely to be effective for treating sensitive bacterial infections.
