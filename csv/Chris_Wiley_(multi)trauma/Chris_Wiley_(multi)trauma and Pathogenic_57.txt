AB  - Abstract Life-history theory concerns the trade-offs that mold the patterns of investment by animals between reproduction, growth, and survival. It is widely recognized that physiology plays a role in the mediation of life-history trade-offs, but the details remain obscure. As life-history theory concerns aspects of investment in the soma that influence survival, understanding the physiological basis of life histories is related, but not identical, to understanding the process of aging. One idea from the field of aging that has gained considerable traction in the area of life histories is that life-history trade-offs may be mediated by free radical production and oxidative stress. We outline here developments in this field and summarize a number of important unresolved issues that may guide future research efforts. The issues are as follows. First, different tissues and macromolecular targets of oxidative stress respond differently during reproduction. The functional significance of these changes, however, remains uncertain. Consequently there is a need for studies that link oxidative stress measurements to functional outcomes, such as survival. Second, measurements of oxidative stress are often highly invasive or terminal. Terminal studies of oxidative stress in wild animals, where detailed life-history information is available, cannot generally be performed without compromising the aims of the studies that generated the life-history data. There is a need therefore for novel non-invasive measurements of multi-tissue oxidative stress. Third, laboratory studies provide unrivaled opportunities for experimental manipulation but may fail to expose the physiology underpinning life-history effects, because of the benign laboratory environment. Fourth, the idea that oxidative stress might underlie life-history trade-offs does not make specific enough predictions that are amenable to testing. Moreover, there is a paucity of good alternative theoretical models on which contrasting predictions might be based. Fifth, there is an enormous diversity of life-history variation to test the idea that oxidative stress may be a key mediator. So far we have only scratched the surface. Broadening the scope may reveal new strategies linked to the processes of oxidative damage and repair. Finally, understanding the trade-offs in life histories and understanding the process of aging are related but not identical questions. Scientists inhabiting these two spheres of activity seldom collide, yet they have much to learn from each other.

AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND RNA interference (RNAi) techniques have emerged as powerful tools to develop novel management strategies for the control of insect pests. The leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus is a natural vector of chrysanthemum yellows phytoplasma and a laboratory vector of Flavescence dorée phytoplasma. Phytoplasmas are insect-borne bacterial plant pathogens that cause economically relevant crop losses worldwide. RESULTS In this study, we demonstrated that microinjection of muscle actin and ATP synthase ? double-stranded (ds)RNAs into adult insects caused an exponential reduction in the expression of both genes, which began within 72?h of dsRNA administration and lasted for 14 days, leading to almost complete silencing of the target genes. Such silencing effects on muscle actin expression appeared to be both time- and dose-dependent. Our results also showed that the knockdown of both genes caused a significant decrease in survival rates in comparison with green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA-injected control insects. CONCLUSION The effectiveness of RNAi-based gene silencing in E. variegatus guarantees the availability of a powerful reverse genetic tool for the functional annotation of its genes and the identification of those potentially involved in the interaction with phytoplasmas. In addition, this study demonstrated that muscle actin and ATP synthase ? may represent candidate genes for RNAi-based control of E. variegatus. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Abstract: Revolutionary advances in tissue engineering are redefining approaches to tissue repair and transplantation through the creation of replacement tissues that remain biointeractive after implantation, imparting physiologic functions as well as structure to the tissue or organ damaged by disease or trauma.1,2 Over the last decade this field has moved from ?science fiction? to ?science fact? with the research-oriented acceptance of its potential to regulatory approvals allowing commercial products to be available for use in many countries. The maintenance of tissue integrity, functionality, and viability from cell seeding through product manufacture, shipping, and end-use has been accomplished through innovations in design and scale-up of both tissue growth and preservation processes. These unique systems have enabled the delivery of tissue-engineered products that are uniform inter- and intra-lot, readily available as off-the-shelf products, easy to use, and efficacious. Skin replacement products are the most advanced, with several tissue-engineered wound care materials on the market in the U.S. and in several international communities.3-5 The potential impact of this field is far broader, offering novel solutions to the medical field for drug screening and development, genetic engineering, and total tissue and organ replacement.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ringworm is an uncommon disease of dogs, but cats, especially the longhaired breeds, are more frequently infected. Of the several dermatophytes involved, Microsporum canis causes 94 per cent of ringworm in cats and 65 per cent in dogs. This species is highly contagious for man but the true incidence of human infection is unknown. Ringworm caused by M canis usually responds readily to treatment, but when the infection establishes in a colony of cats, eradication can be difficult and expensive. Other forms of ringworm in dogs and cats are caused by dermatophytes acquired from wild animals, mainly small rodents such as mice and voles. This is an uncommon and trivial disease of cats, but some infections in dogs can be remarkably persistent and difficult to resolve.

AB  - Summary The ability to cure increasing numbers of individuals for malignant and non-malignant diseases with the use of stem cell transplantation has resulted in a growing number of long-term survivors with unique medical issues. Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) continues to be a significant problem in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting and, as we continue to use alternative stem cell sources and attempt to modulate the immune system to increase an anti-tumour effect, we will probably see rising numbers of patients with this complication. The capacity to treat this problem and improve both the immediate quality of life as well as long-term effects is imperative and requires the ability of haematologists/oncologists to identify chronic GvHD and its multi-organ system presentations. We describe the risk factors for developing chronic GvHD, its presentation and the current treatment options for both initial therapy and secondary treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarises various actions that should be taken preoperatively to help ensure the patient does not become infected. This involves ensuring the patient is clean, free from infection and less likely to acquire infection during surgery. Actions needed during surgery to reduce the chances of infection may include: hand decontamination; incise drapes; sterile gowns; gloves; antiseptic skin preparation; patient temperature; patient oxygenation; perfusion during surgery; and wound irrigation. Postoperative patients who suffer from infection following surgery need to be monitored and treated urgently to prevent further issues with their health and well-being. Patients who have infections before surgery need to be treated to prevent further problems. Postoperative infections must be treated urgently by using antibiotics to cover the range of possible pathogens. To support the patient, recovery practitioners needs training and understanding of the methods used to care for wounds.

AB  - Abstract In multiple sclerosis (MS), the presence of demyelinating plaques has concentrated researchers' minds on the role of the oligodendrocyte in its pathophysiology. Recently, with the rediscovery of early and widespread loss of axons in the disease, new emphasis has been put on the role of axons and axon-oligodendrocyte interactions in MS. Despite the fact that, in 1904, Müller claimed that MS was a disease of astrocytes, more recently, astrocytes have taken a back seat, except as the cells that form the final glial scar after all hope of demyelination is over. However, perhaps it is time for the return of the astrocyte to popularity in the pathogenesis of MS, with recent reports on the dual role of astrocytes in aiding degeneration and demyelination, by promoting inflammation, damage of oligodendrocytes and axons, and glial scarring, but also in creating a permissive environment for remyelination by their action on oligodendrocyte precursor migration, oligodendrocyte proliferation, and differentiation. We review these findings to try to provide a cogent view of astrocytes in the pathology of MS. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Subjects and methods:? Ninety-seven chronic periodontitis (CP) patients and a control group of 51 healthy subjects (HC) were selected. Periodontal status was assessed by criteria based on probing depth, attachment loss, extent, and severity of periodontal breakdown. A polymerase chain reaction method was used to determine the occurrence of T. denticola in saliva samples. Risk indicators for CP were assessed individually and adjusted for confounding and/or interaction using a logistic regression model. Results:? Although univariate analysis revealed a positive association of age ≥30?years, smoking, and salivary carriage of T. denticola with CP, after logistic regression analysis, the association between age ≥30?years/smoking and CP persisted, whereas salivary carriage of T. denticola failed to achieve statistical significance. An interaction effect was significantly detected between these three variables. Conclusion:? Although salivary carriage of T. denticola may be a risk indicator for CP, its pathogenicity should not be exclusively endorsed to its detection in saliva, but it might be associated with the synergistic biological interaction of the bacterium with some demographic characteristics of the susceptible host.

AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Abstract The Infectious Diseases Community of Practice of the American Society of Transplantation has published evidenced-based guidelines on the prevention and management of infectious complications in SOT recipients since 2004. This updated guideline reviews the epidemiology of ventricular assist device (VAD) infections and provides recommendations for the management and prevention of these infections. Almost one half of those awaiting heart transplantation are supported with VADs. Despite advances in device technologies, VAD infections commonly complicate mechanical circulatory support and remain typified by common components and anatomic locations. These infections have important implications for transplant candidates, most notably increased wait-list mortality. Strategic management of these infections is crucial for successful transplantation. Coincidentally, explantation of all VAD components at the time of transplantation is often the definitive cure for the device-associated infection. Highlighted in this updated guideline is the reported success of transplantation in patients with a variety of pre-existing VAD infections and guidance on post-transplant management strategies.

This forum summarises recent peer-reviewed evidence regarding specific items which have been shown to be important in the risk of acquiring new intra-mammary infections across the dry period in an attempt to shed light on those interventions which are likely to impact on the amount of disease in the next lactation. Finally, a group of veterinary advisors that have been trained to deliver the national DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan (http://www.mastitiscontrolplan.co.uk) and have a particular interest in mastitis control are asked for their experiences on practical changes that can be made following identification of dry period origin infection patterns in herds.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology, which delineated six subtypes, has been widely used as the standard for clinical diagnosis of EDS. For most of these subtypes, mutations had been identified in collagen-encoding genes, or in genes encoding collagen-modifying enzymes. Since its publication in 1998, a whole spectrum of novel EDS subtypes has been described, and mutations have been identified in an array of novel genes. The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In addition, a biomaterial implant or device remains at risk of infection by hematogenous spread of bacteria disseminated from infections elsewhere in the body or from infected peri-implant tissue in revision surgery. The resulting infections are frequently accompanied by patient morbidity and discomfort and can lead to surgical replacement of the implant after lengthy, unsuccessful attempts to mitigate infections with antibiotic treatments. Therefore, extensive study is aiming to find new infection-resistant antimicrobial biomaterials and coatings for implants and devices to effectively reduce the incidence of biomaterial-associated infections. An overview of the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacies of the numerous biomaterials currently available is beyond the scope of this review. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of bioactive glasses as biomaterial delivery systems for antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children in the United States. Despite steady improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acquired brain injuries, there has been remarkably little improvement in brain injury therapies and/or pharmacologic treatments over the past decade. One of the reasons may be the inability to properly stratify subjects for clinical trials and/or to have real-time assessment of the effectiveness of a given intervention. It has been recognized for several decades that serum biomarkers may allow for more objective subject stratification as well as act as surrogate markers of treatment efficacy. Despite numerous studies, however, biomarkers are not currently part of clinical practice in either acquired brain injury or other neurologic or musculoskeletal disorders. The goals of this review article, therefore, are to use traumatic brain injury as a example to discuss the use of biomarkers in clinical and randomized controlled trials; to briefly discuss the field of neuroproteomics and its interface with neurologic interventions; and to provide an overview of the collaborative pathway between academia and industry, which needs to be an integral part of the translation of biomarkers from the bench to the bedside in any clinical population. Introduction of the concept of rehabilomics and implications of biomarker use for the physical medicine and rehabilitation physician also are discussed.

AB  - A 10-year-old, domestic shorthair cat was presented for acute lameness of the left forelimb accompanied by severe pain, swelling, skin necrosis, malodorous discharge and pyrexia. Following a presumptive diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis aggressive surgical debridement of the affected soft tissues of the antebrachium and negative pressure wound treatment of the open defect were performed. Surgical findings supported the tentative diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis and Streptococcus canis was isolated from the wound. A free skin graft was performed 29 days after admission, and augmented by 3 days of negative pressure wound therapy to facilitate graft incorporation. Healing was achieved without complications and no functional or aesthetic abnormalities remained.
