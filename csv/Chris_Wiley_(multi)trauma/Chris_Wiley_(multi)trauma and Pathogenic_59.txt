AB  - Abstract The skin is a bilayered organ that serves as a key barrier between an organism and its environment. In addition to protecting against microbial invasion, physical trauma and environmental damage, skin participates in maintaining homeostasis. Skin is also capable of spontaneous self-repair following injury. These functions are mediated by numerous pleiotrophic growth factors, including members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) families. Although growth factor expression has been well documented in mammals, particularly during wound healing, for groups such as reptiles less is known. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of multiple growth factors in normal skin and following a full-thickness cutaneous injury in the representative lizard Eublepharis macularius, the leopard gecko. Unlike mammals, leopard geckos can heal cutaneous wounds without scarring. We demonstrate that before, during and after injury, keratinocytes of the epidermis express a diverse panel of growth factor ligands and receptors, including: VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and phosphorylated VEGFR2; FGF-2 and FGFR1; and phosphorylated SMAD2, TGF?1, and activin ?A. Unexpectedly, only the tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR1 and FGFR1 were dynamically expressed, and only during the earliest phases of re-epithelization; otherwise all the proteins of interest were constitutively present. We propose that the ubiquitous pattern of growth factor expression by keratinocytes is associated with various roles during tissue homeostasis, including protection against ultraviolet photodamage and coordinated body-wide skin shedding.

AB  - Abstract The Wollemi pine, Wollemia nobilis (Araucariaceae), was discovered in 1994 as the only extant member of the genus, previously known only from the fossil record. With fewer than 100 trees known from an inaccessible canyon in southeastern Australia, it is one of the most endangered tree species in the world. We conducted a comparative population genetic survey at allozyme, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci in W. nobilis, Araucaria cunninghamii and Agathis robusta ? representatives of the two sister genera. No polymorphism was detected at 13 allozyme loci, more than 800 AFLP loci or the 20 SSR loci screened in W. nobilis. In Ag. robusta only one of 12 allozyme loci, five of 800 AFLP loci and none of the 15 SSR loci were variable. For A. cunninghamii, 10 of > 800 AFLP loci and five of 20 SSR loci were variable. Thus low genetic diversity characterizes all three species. While not ruling out the existence of genetic variation, we conclude that genetic diversity is exceptionally low in the Wollemi pine. To our knowledge this is the most extreme case known in plants. We conclude that the combination of small population effects, clonality and below-average genetic variation in the family are probable contributing factors to the low diversity. The exceptionally low genetic diversity of the Wollemi pine, combined with its known susceptibility to exotic fungal pathogens, reinforces current management policies of strict control of access to the pines and secrecy of the pine locations.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating and often progressive condition leading to exercise intolerance and frequently the demise of the animal. Although uncommonly encountered in horses, the condition is intensely researched both in human medicine and animal models. Viral infections have long been suspected to play a part in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions in other species. In 2007, an association between equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection and nodular pulmonary fibrosis in horses was suggested and the name equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) was introduced. Recently, the presence of EHV-5 in equine lymphoma has also emerged. The case report by Schwarz et?al. in this issue describes a horse suffering from concurrent T cell leukaemia and EMPF in association with EHV-5. This article summarises current knowledge about EMPF and EHV-5 infections in horses, recent developments in the understanding of pulmonary fibrosis in man and the proposed contribution of viral infections to pulmonary fibrosis and neoplastic conditions.

AB  - Abstract Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?it accounts for approximately 42% of all cases. The lens fibers have the highest protein content within the body, more than 35% of their wet weight. Given the eye lens pure composition of highly abundant structural proteins crystallins (up to 90%), it seems to be an ideal proteomic entity to study and might be also hypothesized to model the other protein conformational diseases. Crystallins are extremely long-lived, and there is virtually no protein turnover. This provides great opportunities for post-translational modifications (PTM) to occur and to predispose lens to the cataract formation. Despite recent progress in proteomics, the human lens proteome remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry hold great promise to determine which crystallin modifications lead to a cataract. Quantitative analysis of PTMs at the peptide level with proteomics is a powerful bioanalytical tool for lens-tissue samples, and provides more comprehensive results. New mass spectrometry-based approaches that are being applied to lens research will be highlighted. Finally, the future directions of proteomics cataract research will be outlined. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1173?1184, 2011

AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic and poly-aetiological autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies to autologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. The defective clearance of apoptotic material, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), provides abundant chromatin or self-dsDNA to trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In SLE patients, the immune complex (IC) of dsDNA and its autoantibodies trigger the robust type I interferon (IFN-I) production through intracellular DNA sensors, which drives the adaptive immune system to break down self-tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the potential resources of self-dsDNA, the mechanisms of self-dsDNA-mediated inflammation through various DNA sensors and its functions in SLE pathogenesis.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - Abstract A 12-year-old, 4 kg, castrated male Persian cat was referred with a 2-month history of sneezing and bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. Rhinoscopically acquired nasal biopsies at this time revealed bilateral lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis. A tapering dose of oral prednisone caused the complete remission of the clinical signs, but 2 months after discontinuation of the therapy, the rhinitis recurred and the OD became exophthalmic. Computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass in both sides of the nasal cavity, both frontal sinuses, the right orbit, and to a lesser extent the left orbit. A fine needle aspirate of the right orbit revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and Aspergillus spp. hyphae. Repeat nasal biopsy demonstrated multi-focal necrosis and a mixed inflammatory cell process which now included macrophages and scattered septate fungal hyphae. A few days later the cat became bilaterally blind and a contrast enhancing lesion involving the optic chiasm was found on magnetic resonance imaging. Despite a poor prognosis, therapy consisted of exenteration of the right orbit and trephination of both frontal sinuses before the planned initiation of medical antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, the cat died of cardiac arrest intraoperatively. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from both orbits at necropsy. Orbital aspergillosis has been rarely reported in cats and its relationship with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is unclear. In this patient lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis or previous antibiotic/corticosteroid therapy may have allowed secondary fungal invasion of the nasal mucosa and subsequently both orbits and the brain. Alternatively, Aspergillus infection may have preceded the lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the hand hygiene (HH) practices among veterinary technicians (VT) and veterinary support staff (VSS) in small animal private practice. Methods: This was a prospective questionnaire-based study involving 182 VT and VSS from 18 small animal hospitals in the USA. Questions asked included gender, number of animals handled per work shift, frequency of hand washing, reason for not washing more frequently, most common available hand washing agent, education regarding the importance of HH and frequency of ring wearing. Results: Less than half of the respondents [76 of 182 (41·7%)] reported washing their hands regularly between handling patients and 154 of 182 (85·6%) believed they should have washed more frequently. The most commonly employed HH agent was hand soap [154 of 182 (84·6%)] and the most common reason cited for not washing more frequently was being too busy [132 of 182 (72·5%)]. Only 96 of 182 (52·7%) respondents were educated by doctors at their hospital regarding the importance of HH. Clinical Significance: The HH practices among VT and VSS in small animal private practice is poor. Hand soap was the most commonly employed agent among respondents in this study. Education of VT and VSS regarding the importance of HH requires improvement.

AB  - ABSTRACT Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is a significant insidious pathogen for postoperative infections in shoulder surgery. Studies have demonstrated that certain topical antibiotic powders used have the potential for chondrotoxicity. Benzylpenicillin, commonly referred to as Penicillin G (Pen G) has the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for C. acnes. There is no research regarding the topical application of Pen G during shoulder surgery, nor has its chondrocyte toxicity been previously investigated. This study sought to characterize the in vitro chondrocyte toxicity of Pen G. Culture-derived bovine chondrocytes were exposed to serial Pen G concentrations and compared with a positive and negative control. A negative control of growth medium and positive control of 1% Triton solution. The chondrocyte viability was assessed via spectrophotometer absorbance. The treatment groups were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation analysis. The chondrocyte viability was significantly higher for all Pen G concentrations as compared with the positive control (p?<?0.001). All concentrations of Pen G exhibited continued chondrocyte metabolic activity over time. Analysis of variance, independent of time, demonstrated no significant decrease in chondrocyte viability for Pen G concentrations ≤6.25?mg/ml, as compared with the negative control (p?>?0.05). Pen G demonstrated a significant negative correlation with its concentration and absorbance (r?=?0.371, p?<?0.001), however, concentrations ≤6.25?mg/ml did not demonstrate a significant decrease in chondrocyte viability (p?=?0.063). Pen G in concentrations appropriate for C. acnes is not significantly chondrotoxic and may be safe for intrawound application. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Evolutionary theory explains why metazoan species are largely protected against the negative fitness effects of cancers. Nevertheless, cancer is often observed at high incidence across a range of species. Although there are many challenges to quantifying cancer epidemiology and assessing its causes, we claim that most modern-day cancer in animals ? and humans in particular ? are due to environments deviating from central tendencies of distributions that have prevailed during cancer resistance evolution. Such novel environmental conditions may be natural and/or of anthropogenic origin, and may interface with cancer risk in numerous ways, broadly classifiable as those: increasing organism body size and/or life span, disrupting processes within the organism, and affecting germline. We argue that anthropogenic influences, in particular, explain much of the present-day cancer risk across life, including in humans. Based on a literature survey of animal species and a parameterised mathematical model for humans, we suggest that combined risks of all cancers in a population beyond c. 5% can be explained to some extent by the influence of novel environments. Our framework provides a basis for understanding how natural environmental variation and human activity impact cancer risk, with potential implications for species ecology.

AB  - Summary Cyathostomins represent a potential cause of equine morbidity and have become the main focus of endoparasite control in managed horses. All grazing horses are at risk of infection with cyathostomins; therefore, the application of appropriate management measures is essential. Anthelmintics currently comprise the main method of control for equine nematodes and the ready availability of these products in some countries has resulted in their use becoming dissociated from veterinary involvement. This is concerning given the levels of anthelmintic resistance that have been recorded in cyathostomin populations. It is important that veterinarians re-establish control over the implementation of parasite control programmes, a major objective of which should be the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. This article details the principles of cyathostomin control in horses with particular reference to anthelmintic resistance, and the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for detecting cyathostomins and identifying anthelmintic resistance.
