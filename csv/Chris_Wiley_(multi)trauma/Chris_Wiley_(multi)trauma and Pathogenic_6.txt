AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to form biofilm on the surface of implanted devices is often considered the most critical virulence factor possessed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in its role as an opportunistic pathogen in orthopaedic device-related infection (ODRI). Despite this recognition, there is a lack of clinical evidence linking outcome with biofilm forming ability for S. epidermidis ODRIs. We prospectively collected S. epidermidis isolates cultured from patients presenting with ODRI. Antibiotic resistance patterns and biofilm-forming ability was assessed. Patient information was collected and treatment outcome measures were determined after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. The primary outcome measure was cure at follow-up. Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on treatment outcome. A total of 124 patients were included in the study, a majority of whom (n?=?90) involved infections of the lower extremity. A clear trend emerged in the lower extremity cohort whereby cure rates decreased as the biofilm-forming ability of the isolates increased (84% cure rate for infections caused by non-biofilm formers, 76% cure rate for weak biofilm-formers, and 60% cure rate for the most marked biofilm formers, p?=?0.076). Antibiotic resistance did not influence treatment cure rate. Chronic immunosuppression was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cure rate (p?=?0.044). Clinical significance: The trend of increasing biofilm-forming ability resulting in lower cure rates for S. epidermidis ODRI indicates biofilm-forming ability of infecting pathogens does influence treatment outcome of infections of the lower extremity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Abstract Implant-related infections are often devastating situations in orthopaedic trauma surgery particularly if multiresistant bacteria are involved. Protection of the implant surface by an antimicrobial coating exhibiting activity against multiresistant bacterial strains is of high interest. Aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of an Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating for fracture fixation devices, such as nails, plates, and external fixators, including tests against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its biocompatibility. The antimicrobial activity of the coating deposited onto 12 ? 3 mm2 stainless steel implants was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and MRSA using different testing methods (ASTM E-2810, JIS Z 2801, proliferation assay). Additionally, the coated devices were implanted into the paravertebral muscle of rabbits and explanted after 2, 7, 14, and 28 days to test the remaining ex vivo antimicrobial activity. For biocompatibility assessment the Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating was tested in vitro according to ISO 10993-5. The Ag/SiOxCy coating exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against all tested bacterial strains in all three in vitro tests. Ex vivo testing proved suppression of more than 99.9 % of bacterial proliferation by the coating compared to non-coated samples even after 28 days. ISO 10993-5 showed good biocompatibility of the coating without any indications of cytotoxic effects. In summary, Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating showed excellent antimicrobial activity including effectiveness against MRSA and good in vitro biocompatibility. Therefore, it possesses high potential as a prophylactic agent in orthopaedic trauma surgery. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2010.

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - The interpretation of diagnostic tests for the detection of subgingival bacterial species is dependent on knowledge of the microbial etiology of destructive periodontal diseases. Specific etiologic agents of these diseases have been sought for over 100 years; however, the complexity of the microbiota, an incomplete understanding of the biology of periodontal diseases, and technical problems have handicapped this search. Nonetheless, a number of possible pathogens have been suggested on the basis of their association with disease, animal pathogenicity, and virulence factors. The immunological response of the host to a species and the relation of successful therapy to the elimination of the species have also been used to support or refute suspected periodontal pathogens. Current data suggest that pathogens are necessary but not sufficient for disease activity to occur. Factors which influence activity include susceptibility of the individual host and the presence of interacting bacterial species which facilitate or impede disease progression. Recent studies have attempted to distinguish virulent and avirulent clonai types of suspected pathogenic species and seek transmission of genetic elements needed for pathogenic species to cause disease. Finally, the local environment of the periodontal pocket may be important in the regulation of expression of virulence factors by pathogenic species. Thus, in order that disease result from a pathogen, 1) it must be a virulent clonal type; 2) it must possess the chromosomal and extra-chromosomal genetic factors to initiate disease; 3) the host must be susceptible to this pathogen; 4) the pathogen must be in numbers sufficient to exceed the threshold for that host; 5) it must be located at the right place; 6) other bacterial species must foster, or at least not inhibit, the process; and 7) the local environment must be one which is conducive to the expression of the species' virulence properties.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Summary The vestibulocochlear organ is a multi-part structure that consists of the external, middle, and inner ear. Given that it can be readily observed on physical examination, the external ear is the focus of this chapter. The purpose of the external ear is to funnel sound toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. This facilitates the special sense of hearing. Although ear shape and structure vary depending upon breed standard, the function of the organ is essentially the same. In order to preserve the sense of hearing, the pinnae need to operate independently of one another, and the external ear needs to be open, as opposed to stenotic. The ear canal also needs to be free of excessive hair, cerumen, or other debris. Abnormal aural presentations are common in clinical practice and include both those problems that are limited to the pinnae and those that involve the external ear canal. Aural hematomas, infestation with Sarcoptes and Notoedres mange mites, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affect primarily the pinnae. By contrast, otitis externa involves inflammation of the external ear canal. Otitis externa is a frequent occurrence in both dogs and cats. Patients with long, droopy ears, excessive ear canal hair, or extensive swimming and/or bathing histories may be predisposed due to the potential for reduced aeration and increased moisture within the ears themselves. Patients with otitis may present with malodorous ears and irritation. Clinical signs frequently include head shaking, pawing, or scratching at the ears, and/or reluctance to allow the clinician to perform otoscopy. Otoscopy and cytology are important diagnostic tools that allow for reliable characterization of aural debris. Interpretation of aural cytology requires the clinician to recognize what constitutes normal resident flora of the ear canal. Bacterial and fungal overgrowth versus infection are important distinctions to make. Culture and drug susceptibility profiles may be indicated as follow-up diagnostic aids, particularly in cases of chronic or recurrent otitis externa, or when the patient's response to therapy is poor. The clinician must also make every attempt to identify the primary cause of aural disease. Ear infections are typically the result of other underlying conditions, including allergic skin disease, autoimmune disease, metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, and parasitic infestation. Without managing these primary causes, otitis externa is likely to recur.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is considered the major cause of death among critically ill patients in the developed world. While there is a general view that this reflects contributions from both the pathogen and the host with respect to an inappropriate inflammatory response, there is a lack of agreement as to the key immune mechanisms. This has been reflected in the diverse range of immunotherapies tested in clinical trials, often with rather marginal effects. The case has been made for a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, the so-called ?cytokine storm?, and for a role of too little immunity through immune paralysis. Apoptosis is implicated as a key mechanism in both this immune paralysis and the multi-organ failure that is a feature of severe sepsis. A number of polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis, including cytokine genes, HLA class II and caspase-12. In this review we focus in particular on the role of group A streptococci in severe sepsis. Here the effect of bacterial superantigens appears to be a correlate of inflammatory activation, although the precise evolutionary role of the superantigens remains unclear.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - Abstract Inherited heart disease causing electric instability in the heart has been suggested to be a risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The purpose of this study was to reveal the correlation between epilepsy-related sudden unexpected death (SUD) and inherited heart disease. Twelve epilepsy-related SUD cases (seven males and five females, aged 11?78 years) were examined. Nine cases fulfilled the criteria of SUDEP, and three cases died by drowning. In addition to examining three major epilepsy-related genes, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine 73 inherited heart disease-related genes. We detected both known pathogenic variants and rare variants with minor allele frequencies of <0.5%. The pathogenicity of these variants was evaluated and graded by eight in silico predictive algorithms. Six known and six potential rare variants were detected. Among these, three known variants of LDB3, DSC2 and KCNE1 and three potential rare variants of MYH6, DSP and DSG2 were predicted by in silico analysis as possibly highly pathogenic in three of the nine SUDEP cases. Two of three cases with desmosome-related variants showed mild but possible significant right ventricular dysplasia-like pathology. A case with LDB3 and MYH6 variants showed hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle and severe fibrosis of the cardiac conduction system. In the three drowning death cases, one case with mild prolonged QT interval had two variants in ANK2. This study shows that inherited heart disease may be a significant risk factor for SUD in some epilepsy cases, even if pathological findings of the heart had not progressed to an advanced stage of the disease. A combination of detailed pathological examination of the heart and gene analysis using NGS may be useful for evaluating arrhythmogenic potential of epilepsy-related SUD.

AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract Defense-related terpenoid biosynthesis in conifers is a dynamic process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid defense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases of the CYP720B group. Extensive studies have been conducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P450 enzymes of the CYP720B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from a broad spectrum of substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP720B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees.

AB  - ABSTRACT? Evidence from many sources supports the view that stressful life events might be relevant for the onset and development of depression, but their pathogenic role is still only poorly understood. One approach in trying to elucidate the role of life events in depression, might be to study them from a multi-factorial point of view, taking into account the vulnerability of the individual experiencing them. As part of such an investigation, 138 depressed patients with a mean age of 45 years have participated in a study of life events and personality traits. In particular, it was tested whether aspects of aggression might interact with the occurrence and perception of external stressful events. Patients who scored high on outward aggression had experienced more stressful events, and patients who scored high on inhibition of aggression had experienced fewer, but more negatively. It is concluded that a combined study of the occurrence of life events and the personality characteristics of the patients experiencing them might enhance our understanding of the pathogenic role of life events in depression.

AB  - Abstract Background? Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). Methods? We report the atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a 36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu?s arteritis. Results? Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole monotherapy. Conclusion? The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB  - This report describes the first clinical case, in Europe, of a high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in a dog. The aim of this report is to alert the veterinary profession to high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in companion animal patients. Multi-drug resistant strains of this pathogen are the cause of considerable problems in human hospitals and for community healthcare professionals worldwide. The potential for a similar impact within veterinary medicine is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Aim To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the interleukin-1 gene cluster (IL1) are associated with the occurrence and severity of inflammatory external root resorption (IERR) after replantation of avulsed permanent teeth. Methodology Indexes of IERR were radiographically assessed in 182 mature replanted permanent teeth from 146 patients at the onset of endodontic therapy. DNA was extracted from buccal mucosa cells and genotyped using TaqMan probes-based assays for the SNPs IL1A -889C/T (rs 180058), IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598). Teeth were grouped into two categories: IERR absent to mild (indexes ≤4) and moderate to severe IERR (indexes >4). Genetic variations in the IL1 gene cluster were tested for their effect on the occurrence and extension of IERR using the GEE model (generalized estimation equation). Patient's age at the moment of injury, timing of pulpectomy, extra-alveolar period and storage condition of the avulsed teeth was included as possible confounders. Results No association was found between SNPs IL1A -889C/T, IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598) and IERR indexes. Timing of pulpectomy (OR 3.5 IC 95% 2.0?6.2 P < 0.001) and patient's age at the moment of trauma (OR 0.29 IC 95% 0.12?0.67 P = 0.004) significantly affected the risk of developing severe IERR. Conclusions While timing of pulpectomy and patient's age at the moment of trauma were confirmed as important risk factors, SNPs within the IL1 gene cluster did not affect the susceptibility for IERR after replantation of permanent teeth.

AB  - Summary:? The gastrointestinal system is a common entry point for pathogenic microbes to access the inner environment of the body. Anti-microbial factors produced by the intestinal mucosa limit the translocation of both commensal and pathogenic microbes across the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. The regulation of these host defense mechanisms largely depends on the activation of innate immune receptors by microbial molecules. Under steady-state conditions, the microbiota provides constitutive signals to the innate immune system, which helps to maintain a healthy inflammatory tone within the intestinal mucosa and, thus, enhances resistance to infection with enteric pathogens. During an acute infection, the intestinal epithelial cell barrier is breached, and the detection of microbial molecules in the intestinal lamina propria rapidly stimulates innate immune signaling pathways that coordinate early defense mechanisms. Herein, we review how microbial molecules shed by both commensal and pathogenic microbes direct host defenses at the intestinal mucosa. We highlight the signaling pathways, effector molecules, and cell populations that are activated by microbial molecule recognition and, thereby, are involved in the maintenance of homeostatic levels of host defense and in the early response to acute enteric infection. Finally, we discuss how manipulation of these host defense pathways by stimulating innate immune receptors is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or alleviate intestinal disease.
