AB  - Psychiatry research has long experienced a stagnation stemming from a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of phenomenologically defined mental disorders. Recently, the application of computational neuroscience to psychiatry research has shown great promise in establishing a link between phenomenological and pathophysiological aspects of mental disorders, thereby recasting current nosology in more biologically meaningful dimensions. In this review, we highlight recent investigations into computational neuroscience that have undertaken either theory- or data-driven approaches to quantitatively delineate the mechanisms of mental disorders. The theory-driven approach, including reinforcement learning models, plays an integrative role in this process by enabling correspondence between behavior and disorder-specific alterations at multiple levels of brain organization, ranging from molecules to cells to circuits. Previous studies have explicated a plethora of defining symptoms of mental disorders, including anhedonia, inattention, and poor executive function. The data-driven approach, on the other hand, is an emerging field in computational neuroscience seeking to identify disorder-specific features among high-dimensional big data. Remarkably, various machine-learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data, and the extracted disorder-specific features have been used for automatic case?control classification. For many disorders, the reported accuracies have reached 90% or more. However, we note that rigorous tests on independent cohorts are critically required to translate this research into clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the utility of the disorder-specific features found by the data-driven approach to psychiatric therapies, including neurofeedback. Such developments will allow simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders using neuroimaging, thereby establishing ?theranostics? for the first time in clinical psychiatry.

AB  - Abstract Evolutionary theory explains why metazoan species are largely protected against the negative fitness effects of cancers. Nevertheless, cancer is often observed at high incidence across a range of species. Although there are many challenges to quantifying cancer epidemiology and assessing its causes, we claim that most modern-day cancer in animals ? and humans in particular ? are due to environments deviating from central tendencies of distributions that have prevailed during cancer resistance evolution. Such novel environmental conditions may be natural and/or of anthropogenic origin, and may interface with cancer risk in numerous ways, broadly classifiable as those: increasing organism body size and/or life span, disrupting processes within the organism, and affecting germline. We argue that anthropogenic influences, in particular, explain much of the present-day cancer risk across life, including in humans. Based on a literature survey of animal species and a parameterised mathematical model for humans, we suggest that combined risks of all cancers in a population beyond c. 5% can be explained to some extent by the influence of novel environments. Our framework provides a basis for understanding how natural environmental variation and human activity impact cancer risk, with potential implications for species ecology.

AB  - Abstract Since the Osler's identification of the inherited nature of hereditary angioedema, a huge array of information was collected on pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. Over the last years, information grew fast, and mutations in different genes, in addition to C1-inhibitor, were found to be causative. All types are inherited as autosomal-dominant traits with incomplete penetrance and little or no genotype-phenotype correlation. As a result, the clinical expression is characterized by a large heterogeneity. The acknowledgement of mechanisms leading to heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype is likely to provide important information not only for a better understanding of the pathogenesis but also for therapy. Regardless of which gene is mutated, similar pathways seem to play a pivotal role, triggering the up-regulation of contact activation system/kallikrein kinin system and giving rise to an unbalanced increase of bradykinin. However, notwithstanding the increase of bradykinin in bloodstream, the phenomenon is localized and no general vascular leakage and oedema is recognized. Thus, it is conceivable that there exist one or more localized factors that stimulate the production of bradykinin, which does not become a systemically event. Uncovering of these factors may shed lights on the missing part of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. The present review, collecting information on pathogenesis from biochemical and genetics investigations, tries to provide a comprehensive view of the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema. This can allow for a better understanding of the disease and lead to focused investigations that can further improve our knowledge.

AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

AB  - Abstract Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a potent superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus that triggers a strong immune response, characterized by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, and often death. When inhaled, SEB can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory failure. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RES), a phytoallexin, on SEB-driven ALI and mortality in mice. We used a dual-exposure model of SEB in C3H/HeJ mice, which caused 100% mortality within the first 5 days of exposure, and treatment with RES resulted in 100% survival of these mice up to 10 days post-SEB exposure. RES reduced the inflammatory cytokines in the serum and lungs, as well as T cell infiltration into the lungs caused by SEB. Treatment with RES also caused increased production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) in the blood and lungs. RES altered the miRNA profile in the immune cells isolated from the lungs. Of these, miR-193a was strongly induced by SEB and was down-regulated by RES treatment. Furthermore, transfection studies and pathway analyses revealed that miR-193a targeted several molecules involved in TGF-? signalling (TGF?2, TGF?R3) and activation of apoptotic pathways death receptor-6 (DR6). Together, our studies suggest that RES can effectively neutralize SEB-mediated lung injury and mortality through potential regulation of miRNA that promote anti-inflammatory activities.

All rights reserved Abstract: Superficial fungal infections are fairly prevalent in transplant recipients and the incidence increases with more intense graft-conserving immunosuppressive therapy. Majocchi's granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytes that involves deeper layers of the dermis. Only a few case reports of the condition have been documented in transplant recipients. After an extensive review of the medical literature, 21 cases were retrieved and are summarized here, together with a new case that occurred in a recent heart transplant recipient from our institution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, with special focus on potential risk factors, offending pathogens, clinical presentation, therapeutic approaches, and outcome. General observations are presented emphasizing the relevance of close clinical and dermatologic follow-up in high-risk SOT patients with specific comments regarding treatment regimens and outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Minimum intervention dentistry (MID) is the modern medical approach to the management of caries, utilizing caries risk assessment, and focusing on the early prevention and interception of disease. Moving the focus away from the restoration of teeth allows the dentist to achieve maximum intervention, with minimal invasive treatments. The four core principles of MID can be considered to be: (1) Recognition ? early identification and assessment of potential caries risk factors through lifestyle analysis, saliva testing and using plaque diagnostic tests; (2) Reduction ? to eliminate or minimize caries risk factors by altering diet and lifestyle habits and increasing the pH of the oral environment; (3) Regeneration ? to arrest and reverse incipient lesions, using appropriate topical agents including fluorides and casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphates (CPP-ACP); (4) Repair ? when cavitation is present and surgical intervention is required, conservative caries removal is carried out to maximize the repair potential of the tooth and retain tooth structure. Bioactive materials are used to restore the tooth and promote internal healing of the dentine. Effective implementation of MID involves integrating each of these four elements into patient assessment and treatment planning. This review paper discusses the key principles of MID as a philosophy of patient care, and the practical objectives which flow into individual patient care.

AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - Abstract The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is an important physiologic barrier that separates CNS from soluble inflammatory mediators and effector immune cells from peripheral circulation. The optimum function of the BBB is necessary for the homeostasis, maintenance, and proper neuronal function. The clinical and experimental findings have shown that BBB dysfunction is an early hallmark of various neurologic disorders ranging from inflammatory autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and traumatic diseases to neuroinvasive infections. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the regulation of BBB function under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. Several neurologic disease-modifying drugs have shown to improve the BBB function. However, they have a broad-acting immunomodulatory function and can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. The recent development of in vitro multicomponent 3-dimensional BBB models coupled with fluidics chamber as well as a cell-type specific reporter and knockout mice gave a new boost to our understanding of the dynamics of the BBB. In the review, we discuss the current understanding of BBB composition and recent findings that illustrate the critical regulatory elements of the BBB function under physiologic and inflammatory conditions, and also suggested the strategies to control BBB structure and function.

AB  - In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest the efficacy of various skin protection measures in the prevention of hand dermatitis (HD). The aims and objectives of this intervention study was to quantify the efficacy of skin protection (SP) measures and UVB hardening in the prevention of HD. SP measures were compared against UVB hardening in a controlled clinical trial of 94 apprentices. The apprentices were assigned to the intervention arms class-wise. Baker apprentices involved in a previous follow-up study served as an additional historic control group representing no intervention. The apprentices were interviewed and examined in a standardised way at the beginning of the vocational training and at four follow-ups. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured at the back of the hands. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the controls (C)(29.1%) followed by the UVB-group (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7%(95%CI ?8.5 to 28.1) and 15.8%(95%CI ?2.4 to 33.9), respectively. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed atopy (OR?=?4.74, 95%CI 1.12?20.11, p?=?0.035) and skin care (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16?0.86, p?=?0.023) to be independent risk factors. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95%CI 0.17?3.70) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.09?1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. The trends in the clinical results were confirmed by statistically significant differences in TEWL values. Apprentices in the SP group consistently had a lower prevalence of HD compared to the apprentices in the UVB and C group. These trends were reinforced by statistically significant differences in TEWL levels. A multi-centre trial is recommended to confirm the efficacy of SP measures in a larger randomised study.

AB  - Plants possess a variety of structures that harbor ant nests, and the morphology of these domatia determines the nature of ant?plant mutualisms in a given plant species. In this study, we report on the differences in anatomy between myrmecophytes of Piper, which are regularly excavated by an obligate ant mutualist (Pheidole bicornis) and nonmyrmecophytes of Piper, which consistently have solid stems. Stems of excavated plant species lacked outward evidence of modification; however, striking anatomical differences were apparent between hollow-stemmed species before excavation and the remainder of the solid-stemmed species studied. Prior to excavation by ants, stems of myrmecophytes were characterized by strongly heterogeneous piths in which a large, central area had relatively large cells lacking intracellular crystals with a periphery of smaller cells containing numerous crystals. The domatium excavated by the ants was restricted to the large-celled region. This is the first report of the absence of crystals in ant-excavated portions of stems of myrmecophytes. Cauline domatia became lined with 3?8 cell layers of suberized wound tissue, which may have an impact on nutrient absorption by Piper myrmecophytes.

AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

AB  - Background Endoscopic skull-base surgery (ESBS) is employed in the management of diverse skull-base pathologies. Paralleling the increased utilization of ESBS, the literature in this field has expanded rapidly. However, the rarity of these diseases, the inherent challenges of surgical studies, and the continued learning curve in ESBS have resulted in significant variability in the quality of the literature. To consolidate and critically appraise the available literature, experts in skull-base surgery have produced the International Consensus Statement on Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery (ICAR:ESBS). Methods Using previously described methodology, topics spanning the breadth of ESBS were identified and assigned a literature review, evidence-based review or evidence-based review with recommendations format. Subsequently, each topic was written and then reviewed by skull-base surgeons in both neurosurgery and otolaryngology. Following this iterative review process, the ICAR:ESBS document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results The ICAR:ESBS document addresses the role of ESBS in primary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, benign skull-base and orbital pathology, sinonasal malignancies, and clival lesions. Additionally, specific challenges in ESBS including endoscopic reconstruction and complication management were evaluated. Conclusion A critical review of the literature in ESBS demonstrates at least the equivalency of ESBS with alternative approaches in pathologies such as CSF rhinorrhea and pituitary adenoma as well as improved reconstructive techniques in reducing CSF leaks. Evidence-based recommendations are limited in other pathologies and these significant knowledge gaps call upon the skull-base community to embrace these opportunities and collaboratively address these shortcomings.

AB  - Abstract Thermal injury destroys the physical skin barrier that normally prevents invasion of microorganisms. This and concomitant depression of local and systemic host cellular and humoral immune responses are important factors that contribute to colonization and infection of the burn wound. One of the most common burn wound pathogens is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is both a human commensal and a frequent cause of infections leading to mild to life-threatening diseases. Despite a variety of infection control measures, for example patient cohorting and contact precaution at burn centres, S. aureus is still frequently encountered in burn wounds. Colonization with S. aureus has been associated with delayed wound healing, increased need for surgical interventions, and prolonged length of stay at burn centres. In this minireview, we focus on S. aureus nasal carriage in relation to S. aureus burn wound colonization and subsequent infection, and its impact on strategies for infection control.

AB  - Summary This paper describes and compares three techniques of categorisation of hay, straw and other feeds and beddings collected from stables. A hand-held sampler was used to categorise samples according to the presence of plant material, fungal spores and dust mites. An Andersen sampler was used to categorise samples according to the thermotolerances of fungi and actinomycetes. An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to categorise samples according to respirable particle release rates. The highest burden of respirable particles was associated with the presence of thermophilic and thermotolerant actinomycetes and fungi. The portable slit sampler proved to be an accurate, quick and simple semiquantitative method of assessing the mould contamination of source materials. This latter technique requires only a microscope and the sampler, and is thus ideal for veterinary practices and small diagnostic laboratories.
