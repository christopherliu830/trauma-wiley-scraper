AB  - Summary Cumulative evidence indicates a role for the complement system in both pathology and recovery after ischemic stroke. Here, we review the current understanding of the dual role of complement in poststroke injury and recovery, and discuss the challenges of anti-complement therapies. Most complement directed therapeutics currently under investigation or development systemically inhibit the complement system, but since complement is important for immune surveillance and is involved in various homeostatic activities, there are potential risks associated with systemic inhibition. Depending on the target within the complement pathway, other concerns are high concentrations of inhibitor required, low efficacy and poor bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, approaches to target complement inhibitors to specific sites have been investigated. Here, we discuss targeting strategies, with a focus on strategies developed in our lab, to specifically localize complement inhibition to sites of tissue injury and complement activation, and in particular to the postischemic brain. We discuss various injury site-specific targeted complement inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic stroke treatment, as well as their use as investigative tools for probing complement-dependent pathophysiological processes.

AB  - Summary This paper describes and compares three techniques of categorisation of hay, straw and other feeds and beddings collected from stables. A hand-held sampler was used to categorise samples according to the presence of plant material, fungal spores and dust mites. An Andersen sampler was used to categorise samples according to the thermotolerances of fungi and actinomycetes. An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to categorise samples according to respirable particle release rates. The highest burden of respirable particles was associated with the presence of thermophilic and thermotolerant actinomycetes and fungi. The portable slit sampler proved to be an accurate, quick and simple semiquantitative method of assessing the mould contamination of source materials. This latter technique requires only a microscope and the sampler, and is thus ideal for veterinary practices and small diagnostic laboratories.

AB  - Abstract Thermal injury destroys the physical skin barrier that normally prevents invasion of microorganisms. This and concomitant depression of local and systemic host cellular and humoral immune responses are important factors that contribute to colonization and infection of the burn wound. One of the most common burn wound pathogens is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is both a human commensal and a frequent cause of infections leading to mild to life-threatening diseases. Despite a variety of infection control measures, for example patient cohorting and contact precaution at burn centres, S. aureus is still frequently encountered in burn wounds. Colonization with S. aureus has been associated with delayed wound healing, increased need for surgical interventions, and prolonged length of stay at burn centres. In this minireview, we focus on S. aureus nasal carriage in relation to S. aureus burn wound colonization and subsequent infection, and its impact on strategies for infection control.

AB  - Summary Exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) is a serious problem in the Thoroughbred industry. The condition apparently occurs essentially in all Thoroughbreds in training but the mechanism has proved elusive. There is now strong evidence that the condition is caused by mechanical failure of the walls of the pulmonary capillaries when the pressure inside them rises to very high levels. It is well known that pulmonary capillaries have extremely thin walls to allow rapid exchange of respiratory gases across them. Recently we have shown that the wall stresses are very large when the capillary transmural pressure is raised, and in anesthetised rabbits, ultrastructural damage to the walls is seen at pressures of 40 mmHg and above. The incidence of stress failure is greatly increased at high lung volumes; and many of the ultrastructural changes are rapidly reversible when the capillary pressure is reduced. The principal forces acting on the capillary have been analysed. The strength of the thin part of the capillary wall can be attributed to the Type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix. The pulmonary vascular pressures of galloping Thoroughbreds reach very high levels. Mean pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures of up to 120 and 70 mmHg respectively have been directly measured with indwelling catheters. The reason for the high pulmonary vascular pressures is that these animals have been selectively bred over hundreds of years to run at great speeds over short distances and their maximal oxygen consumptions are very high. As a consequence, cardiac outputs are substantial, and the left ventricle needs very high filling pressures. Ultrastructural studies of Thoroughbred lungs after galloping show the typical changes of stress failure of capillaries. Calculations of capillary wall stress from measurements of the radius of the capillaries and the thickness of the wall confirm that the stresses are very high. The fact that the lesions of EIPH are most commonly seen initially in the dorso caudal region of the lung appears to argue against the stress failure hypothesis. However, it is known that resting blood flow is particularly high to that region and it may also be that the alveolar pressure falls transiently to very low levels or that the alveoli in that region are overexpanded. All these factors could increase capillary wall stress. There is evidence that frusemide reduces pulmonary vascular pressures during galloping. However, the blood gas barrier needs to be extremely thin for gas exchange, but immensely strong to withstand the capillary wall stresses. Thoroughbreds fail on both counts. First they develop arterial hypoxaemia as a result of diffusion limited oxygen transfer in the lung during galloping and, therefore, they cannot afford to have thicker blood-gas barriers. On the other hand, their capillary walls are not strong enough to withstand the substantial wall stresses that develop as a result of the high capillary pressures. Therefore, to some extent, EIPH is an inevitable consequence of the extremely high cardiac outputs required by these elite athletes.

AB  - This is the first annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Rather than publish only new references, the previous list has been totally revised. Approximately one quarter of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. In addition, the bibliography has been expanded to include a number of new topics, with over one hundred more references. In preparing this revised list, many good articles were, of necesssity, excluded. The number of publications pertinent to clinical geriatrics has grown quickly over the past year. Preference, as before, was given to recent publications, since they usually provide a list of the important earlier articles. Most of the references are less than five years old; the exceptions deal with specific issues not covered as well in the subsequent literature. An occasional review article is cited to cover gaps in the geriatric literature or merely to amplify aspects of common diseases that have been widely ignored outside of geriatric medicine. Most of the references selected deal specifically with an elderly patient population. Exceptions include those dealing with diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study from a geriatric viewpoint exists, e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. All studies in geriatrics are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, relative obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The first set of references (I) includes synopses on the causation of aging, the second (II) on the systems known to degenerate with advancing age. The next two topics (III, IV) are clinically related: one deals with the basic distinctions of the geriatric patient and the other with the ancillary services available. As geriatrics is basically a multidisciplinary field, the bulk of the references are cited by pertinent specialty.

AB  - Abstract Biocompatible tissue growth has excellent prospects for tissue engineering. These tissues are built over scaffolds, which can influence aspects such as cell adhesion, proliferation rate, morphology, and differentiation. However, the ideal 3D biological structure has not been developed yet. Here, we applied the electro-hydrodynamic jet (E-jet) 3D printing technology using poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) solution to print varied culture platforms for engineered tissue structures. The effects of different parameters (electrical voltage, plotting speed, and needle sizes) on the outcome were investigated. We compared the biological compatibility of the 3D printed culture platforms with that of random fibers. Finally, we used the 3D-printed PLGA platforms to culture fibroblasts, the main cellular components of loose connective tissue. The results show that the E-jet printed platforms could guide and improve cell growth. These highly aligned fibers were able to support cellular alignment and proliferation. Cell angle was consistent with the direction of the fibers, and cells cultured on these fibers showed a much faster migration, potentially enhancing wound healing performance. Thus, the potential of this technology for 3D biological printing is large. This process can be used to grow biological scaffolds for the engineering of tissues. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Antimicrobial use is known to select for the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria; therefore prudent use in both human and veterinary medicine is essential to preserve their efficacy. Objectives: To characterise antimicrobial prescribing patterns in UK equine practice and evaluate factors associated with prescribing. Methods: A postal questionnaire including 4 clinical scenarios was sent to 740 veterinary surgeons that treat horses. Data were collected on the clinician, their practice and sources of information regarding antimicrobials and their use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain factors associated with 5 outcomes; prescribing off-licence drugs; prescribing at incorrect doses; prescribing 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporins; prescribing fluoroquinolones and prescribing potentiated sulphonamides. Results: Questionnaires were completed by 38% of veterinary surgeons who were sent questionnaires. Less than 1% of practices had antimicrobial use guidelines. Trimethoprim-sulphonamides were most commonly prescribed in each clinical scenario. Eleven percent of prescriptions were for antimicrobial drugs not licensed for use in horses in the UK. Five percent of prescriptions for licensed antimicrobials were under the recommended dose rate and 56% over the recommended dose rate. Fluoroquinolones and 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins accounted for 1 and 3% of prescriptions, respectively. Veterinary surgeons working at referral practices were more likely to prescribe 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and off-licence antimicrobials whereas those working in first-opinion practices were more likely to prescribe potentiated sulphonamides. Sources of information regarding antimicrobials also had an effect on prescribing. Conclusions and potential relevance: Prescription of antimicrobials at inappropriate doses was common even when provided with the weight of the animal. It is uncommon for UK equine veterinary practices to have guidelines for antimicrobial use. The introduction of such guidelines could lead to more prudent use of antimicrobials.

The hybrid scaffold has shown promise as a potential strategy for the treatment of such defects. In this study, a novel biomimetic porous collagen (Col)/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold was fabricated through assembling layers of Col containing gradual amount of HA under the assistance of ?iterative layering? freeze-drying process. The scaffold presents a double gradient of highly interconnected porosity and HA content from top to bottom, mimicking the inherent physiological structure of bone. Owing to the biomimetic structure and component, significant increase of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro was observed, illustrating potential application of the excellent Col/HA scaffold as a promising strategy for bone tissue engineering. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary. No disease-specific tool for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL), an important outcome when assessing medical treatment, has been developed for children with haemophilia. The goal of this study was to develop a parent-administered questionnaire for evaluating quality of life (QOL) in paediatric haemophilia patients between 2 and 6?years of age. After interviewing physicians (5), nurses (5) and parents (10) of children with haemophilia aged between 2 and 6?years, 92 questions were developed and pilot-tested with parents (44) of children with haemophilia to create a 39-question instrument that assessed somatic symptoms, physical functioning, sleep disturbance, stigma, social functioning, fear/resentment, mood/behaviour, restrictions, treatment upset, haemophilia concern and energy level. Reliability and validity were evaluated with 103 parents of children with haemophilia and parents of 249 age- and gender-matched healthy children. Estimates of scale reliability (internal consistency) for eight multi-item scales ranged from 0.73 to 0.94. Results showed construct validity (correlations with age, severity of haemophilia, treatment type, days absent and days confined to bed) and correlated with two general, paediatric quality-of-life instruments (Impact on Family Scale and Functional Status II(R). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by comparing scores between patients receiving/not receiving prophylactic therapy and between haemophilia patients and healthy controls. This disease-specific HRQL measure should be of use in clinical trials and general practice to better understand disease and treatment impacts in young children with haemophilia.

AB  - Abstract At the beginning of the 20th century the phenomenon of spontaneous bacterial lysis was discovered independently by Twort and d'Herelle. Despite the suggestion at that time by d'Herelle that these agents might be applied to the control of bacterial diseases in the west this idea was explored in a desultory fashion only and was eventually discarded largely due to the advent of extensive antibiotic usage. However, interest was maintained in countries of the former Soviet Union where bacteriophage therapy has been applied extensively since that time. Central to this work was the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was founded in 1923 through the joint efforts of d'Herelle and the Georgian George Eliava. Ironically, given his contributions to public health in the Soviet Union, Eliava was branded as an enemy of the people in 1937 and executed. d'Herelle never again returned to Georgia. In spite of these tragic events this institute remained the focus for phage therapy in the world and despite being continuously active in this field for 75 years, now struggles for its financial life. In the Eliava Institute, phages were sought for bacterial pathogens implicated in disease outbreaks in different parts of the Soviet Union and were dispatched for use in hospitals throughout the country. Although infections caused by a wide variety of bacterial pathogens have been treated, much of this has been published in Russian and is not readily available in the west. Work has also been carried out in Poland over many years and this has only recently been published in English. By contrast, interest in the west has been limited to a small number of enthusiasts and academics and until very recently little interest has been shown. The main reason that the medical and scientific communities are now beginning to take notice, is the continuing world-wide rise in the incidence of multiply-antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens and the absence of effective means for their control. Recent publicity over the work of the Eliava Institute has concentrated the minds of the western world on the potential for infectious disease control that bacteriophage offer, a procedure that is biologically more acceptable than antibiotic use and which has been in use for several decades already. ? 2001 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Abstract The alphaviruses are principally mosquito-borne, positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Togaviridae that exhibit a broad range of pathogenicity in humans and animals (1, 2). Members of the genus are distributed worldwide in diverse ecological niches, where they are usually maintained in cycles between mosquitoes and birds or mammals. While human infections generally are incidental to the transmission cycles, in some instances human-mosquito-human cycles can maintain transmission and lead to large outbreaks and epidemics. Among the 24 alphaviruses listed in Table 1, 16 have been associated with human illness. Clinically, these manifest most commonly as polyarthralgia, often accompanied by fever and/or rash, or as central nervous system (CNS) infections. In addition to the alphaviruses circulating between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, a single example of an alphavirus, restricted to mosquitoes, has recently been described, Eilat virus (EILV) (3), and there are two known aquatic species, southern elephant seal virus (SESV) and salmon pancreatic disease virus (SPDV), that are likely to have lice as vectors (4, 5). This chapter reviews general aspects of the virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention of the alphavirus infections, followed by more detailed discussion of those that cause human disease.

AB  - Abstract. Purpose:? Ocular surface reconstruction with cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation technique is a viable treatment option for severe ocular surface injuries and diseases with limbal stem cell deficiency. Currently, this technique is based on utilization of xenogenic, allogenic or undefined components such as murine 3T3 feeders, serum and amniotic membrane. In this study, we aimed to find a more defined culture method to generate stratified human oral mucosal epithelium. Methods:? In this study, we have examined the formation of stratified cell sheets from human oral mucosal epithelial cells under serum-free culture environment both in the absence and presence of fibroblast-conditioned culture medium and elevated epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentration. Results:? In all examined culture conditions, the cultivated oral epithelial cells formed a stratified tissue, which was positive for keratins K3/12, K4 and K13. The tissue-engineered oral epithelia also expressed proliferation and progenitor markers Ki67 and p63 in the basal layer of the cell sheets, suggesting that the epithelia still had regenerative capacity. The cultures presented expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and high transepithelial electrical resistance values. Conclusion:? In this culture method, we have been able to produce stratified cell sheets successfully without serum, conditioning of the medium or increased EGF concentration. We provide a novel protocol to produce tight multi-layered epithelium with proliferative potential, which can be easily adapted for cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Understanding the mechanisms implicated in the initial attachment, development, and maturation of a biofilm phenotype are of tremendous importance for their effect on the medical, industrial, and public health arenas. This review explores the current understanding of the nature of biofilms and the impact that molecular interactions between the bacteria themselves, as well as between bacteria and the host, may have on biofilm development and phenotype using the nonmotile Gram-positive coccus, Staphylococcus aureus, as an example.
