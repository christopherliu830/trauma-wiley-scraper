AB  - Abstract For millions of years, microbiota residing within us, including those in the oral cavity, coexisted in a harmonious symbiotic fashion that provided a quintessential foundation for human health. It is now clear that disruption of such a healthy relationship leading to microbial dysbiosis causes a wide array of infections, ranging from localized, mild, superficial infections to deep, disseminated life-threatening diseases. With recent advances in research, diagnostics, and improved surveillance we are witnessing an array of emerging and re-emerging oral infections and orofacial manifestations of systemic infections. Orofacial infections may cause significant discomfort to the patients and unnecessary economic burden. Thus, the early recognition of such infections is paramount for holistic patient management, and oral clinicians have a critical role in recognizing, diagnosing, managing, and preventing either new or old orofacial infections. This paper aims to provide an update on current understanding of well-established and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal infections manifesting in the human oral cavity.

AB  - Summary Diagnosing a foot ulcer infection must be based on clinical criteria. Wound infections are categorized as mild, moderate or severe. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic pathogens and fungi assist in the management of infection. Acute or chronic paronychia is an inflammatory reaction involving the folds of tissue surrounding a fingernail or toenail. Fungal infections develop as a result of poor foot hygiene, hyperhidrosis, or the accumulation of moist detritus in the webs. A phlegmon is a diffuse acute suppurative inflammation of the soft or connective tissue caused by infection. It develops within hours or a few days, after an infection spreads from an infected ulcer to the adjacent soft tissues. Exotoxin-producing clostridia and other anaerobic microorganisms may cause gas gangrene. Septic arthritis of the metatarsophalangeal joint is often a complication of a neuropathic ulcer under the metatarsal head. Empirical treatment with antibiotics in severe foot infections should always include agents against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobes.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Non-thermal gas plasmas (NTGPs) are a promising emergent medical technology.a Unlike thermal plasmas, they generate a complex room temperature mix of reactive species which interact with tissues. The characterization of candidate plasmas and their interaction with tissues has shown that they produce a variety of broadly dose dependent effects ranging from fibroblast proliferation to angiogenesis and bacterial destruction. These findings, supported by recent experiments using skin models, suggest that NTGP's could potentially play an important role in both decontaminating acute and chronic wounds and accelerating healing. However, important issues over toxicological and environmental safety remain unanswered and a number of regulatory and technical hurdles will need to be overcome before a NTGP medical device is released.

These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.

AB  - A liver, heart, iliac vessel and two kidneys were recovered from a 39-year-old man who died of traumatic head injury and were transplanted into five recipients. The liver recipient 18 days posttransplantation presented with headache, ataxia and fever, followed by rapid neurologic decline and death. Diagnosis of granulomatous amebic encephalitis was made on autopsy. Balamuthia mandrillaris infection was confirmed with immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Donor and recipients' sera were tested for B. mandrillaris antibodies. Donor brain was negative for Balamuthia by immunohistochemistry and PCR; donor serum Balamuthia antibody titer was positive (1:64). Antibody titers in all recipients were positive (range, 1:64?1:512). Recipients received a four- to five-drug combination of miltefosine or pentamidine, azithromycin, albendazole, sulfadiazine and fluconazole. Nausea, vomiting, elevated liver transaminases and renal insufficiency were common. All other recipients survived and have remained asymptomatic 24 months posttransplant. This is the third donor-derived Balamuthia infection cluster described in solid organ transplant recipients in the United States. As Balamuthia serologic testing is only available through a national reference laboratory, it is not feasible for donor screening, but may be useful to determine exposure status in recipients and to help guide chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Erythromycin is often overlooked for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of erythromycin particles in tablets and of cefadroxil in 164 patients with skin infections; both treatments were given as 500 mg twice daily. One hundred percent of erythromycin and 96% of cefadroxil patients were clinically cured or improved, and 98% of susceptible pathogens were eradicated in both groups. Only three erythromycin patients and one cefadroxil patient left the study early because of GI-related adverse events. Erythromycin, therefore, was as effective and safe as cefadroxil in the treatment of mild-to-moderate skin infections.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the following skin and soft-tissue infections: impetigo, furuncles, cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, diabetic foot infections and animal bites. In cases of a non-resolving impetigo, infection may be with community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP/SMX should be considered. Furuncles, or ?boils?, are infections of hair follicles usually caused by S. aureus. Cellulitis usually presents with pain, erythema with typically indistinct borders, and swelling. Erysipelas is a distinctive form of cellulitis. The literature on necrotizing fasciitis is predominately empiric, based on retrospective reviews and small case series. Diabetic foot infections should be classified using a valid classification system based on the extent of local infection, involvement of deeper tissues and systemic inflammatory response. Animal bites are very common, but the vast majority of people never seek medical attention.

AB  - Summary Fusarium species are emerging causative agents of superficial, cutaneous and systemic human infections. In a study of the prevalence and genetic diversity of 464 fungal isolates from a dermatological ward in Thailand, 44 strains (9.5%) proved to belong to the genus Fusarium. Species identification was based on sequencing a portion of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α), rDNA internal transcribed spacer and RNA-dependent polymerase subunit II (rpb2). Our results revealed that 37 isolates (84%) belonged to the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), one strain matched with Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC) complex 33, while six others belonged to the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex. Within the FSSC two predominant clusters represented Fusarium falciforme and recently described F. keratoplasticum. No gender differences in susceptibility to Fusarium were noted, but infections on the right side of the body prevailed. Eighty-nine per cent of the Fusarium isolates were involved in onychomycosis, while the remaining ones caused paronychia or severe tinea pedis. Comparing literature data, superficial infections by FSSC appear to be prevalent in Asia and Latin America, whereas FOSC is more common in Europe. The available data suggest that Fusarium is a common opportunistic human pathogens in tropical areas and has significant genetic variation worldwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND Astronauts on exploration missions may be at risk for traumatic injury and medical conditions that lead to life threatening hemorrhage. Resuscitation protocols are limited by the austere conditions of spaceflight. Solutions may be found in low-resource terrestrial settings. The existing literature on alternative blood product administration and walking blood banks was evaluated for applicability to spaceflight. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was done using PubMed and Google Scholar. References were crosschecked for additional publications not identified using the initial search terms. Twenty-seven articles were identified, including three controlled trials, six retrospective cohort analyses, 15 reviews, one case report, and two experimental studies. RESULTS Solutions to blood transfusion in austere settings include lyophilized blood products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and fresh whole blood. Many of these products are investigational. Protocols for walking blood banks include methods for screening and activating donors, transfusion, and monitoring for adverse reactions. Microgravity and mission limitations create additional challenges for transfusion, including baseline physiologic changes, difficulty reconstituting lyophilized products, risk of air emboli during transfusion, equipment constraints, and limited evacuation and surgical options. CONCLUSION Medical planning for space exploration should consider the possibility of acute blood loss. A model for ?floating? blood banks based on terrestrial walking blood bank protocols from austere environments is presented, with suggestions for future development. Constraints on volume, mass, storage, and crew, present challenges to blood transfusion in space and must be weighed against the benefits of expanding medical capabilities.

AB  - Abstract Conventionally, the history of microbiology begins with the studies of Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century [this section is reviewed elegantly in Bulloch (1938)]. Using crude but ingenious microscopes fashioned by hand, this erstwhile haberdasher first revealed the unseen microbial world. It would take more than two centuries before the contributions of these microorganisms to the ecology of the biosphere would be revealed. Pasteur inaugurated the study of functional microbiology with his work on fermentation in the late 1850s. In 1863, he described the phenomenon of anaerobic microbial life and first coined the terms aerobic and anaerobic. Pasteur is of course best known for his many seminal contributions to microbial pathogenesis later in his life.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.
