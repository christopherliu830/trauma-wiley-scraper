AB  - Background Porcine ulcerative dermatitis syndrome (PUDS) is a rare disease of breeding sows with an unknown pathogenesis. Objective To describe the evolution of clinical and histopathological lesions over the course of the disease and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Animal A 24-month-old, pluriparous, large white sow presented during gestation with ulcerations around the teats compatible with PUDS. Methods and results Clinical and histopathological lesions were monitored over the course of the disease (i.e. during and after the subsequent pregnancy). A clear gestation-dependent flare of the lesions was observed with partial resolution occurring postpartum. The histological pattern presented as a lymphocytic interface dermatitis. Conclusions and clinical importance The findings in this case report link gestation with the development of clinical signs and histological changes. Multiparity appears to enhance severity and may finally result in a self-perpetuating disease. Therefore, it seems advisable to cull breeding sows after they have developed PUDS.

AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a major problem of health in developed countries, with important consequences in disability and health economics. Recent findings in CNS genomics and pharmacogenomics suggest that the introduction of pharmacogenomic procedures in clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics (efficacy and safety issues). The genes involved in the pharmacogenomics of CNS drugs fall into five categories: (i) genes associated with CNS pathogenesis; (ii) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (iii) genes associated with drug metabolism; (iv) genes associated with drug transporters; and (v) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 30?90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Only 20?30% of the Caucasian population processes normally approximately 60% of the current drugs that are metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Clinical pharmacogenomics may contribute to personalizing pharmacological treatment, predicting patient/drug-dose selection, minimizing drug interactions, increasing drug efficacy, and reducing unnecessary costs.

AB  - We describe two unrelated patients with molecularly confirmed Sotos syndrome with multiple subpleural blebs and pneumothorax. We propose this as a new association. Patient 1 is a 3-year-old boy with a 1.9?Mb interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, with breakpoints at q35.2 and q35.3, encompassing NSD1 and Patient 2 is a 9-year-old girl with a de novo truncating mutation within NSD1. Both patients presented with sudden onset dyspnea due to a unilateral pneumothorax: Patient 1 at the age of 18 months and Patient 2 at 9 years. In both, the pneumothorax recurred following removal of the chest drain and, on further investigations, multiple subpleural blebs were identified necessitating a pleurodesis and tissue resection. This is the first report of multiple subpleural blebs leading to pneumothorax in association with Sotos syndrome. Given the similar and unusual presentation in the two affected patients, we suggest that this may be a real association, albeit a rare one. While screening would not be advocated for such a rare association, we recommend that clinicians consider pneumothorax in patients with Sotos syndrome and sudden onset of dyspnea and are aware that it may be refractory to first line treatment. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Foot infections in diabetic patients are a common, complex and costly problem. They are potentially adverse with progression to deeper spaces and tissues and are associated with severe complications. The management of diabetic foot infection (DFI) requires a prompt and systematic approach to achieve more successful outcomes and to ultimately avoid amputations. This study reviews a multi-step treatment for DFIs. Between September 2010 and September 2012, a total of about 37 patients were consulted for DFI. The treatment algorithm included four steps, that is, several types of debridement according to the type of wound, the application of negative pressure therapy (NPT), other advanced dressings, a targeted antibiotic therapy local or systemic as the case may, and, if necessary, reconstructive surgery. This treatment protocol showed excellent outcomes, allowing us to avoid amputation in most difficult cases. Only about 8% of patients require amputation. This treatment protocol and a multidisciplinary approach with a specialised team produced excellent results in the treatment of DFI and in the management of diabetic foot in general, allowing us to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients and also to ensure cost savings.

AB  - Patient X: A 67-year-old Caucasian man slips on a patch of ice. He has abrasions to his hands and has sustained significant damage to his hip. At the emergency room, he informs clinicians he takes atorvastatin, metformin, and glimepiride to treat hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). X-rays reveal a fractured hip, which will require total hip replacement surgery.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on spontaneous conditions seen in conventionally raised mice, conditions that often differ from those seen in laboratory mice. Mycoplasma pulmonis, an important agent of chronic murine respiratory disease, has been eradicated largely from laboratory mouse colonies but remains a very important infection of mice raised and housed under conventional conditions. Subclinical infections are common with M. pulmonis, and signs may not manifest until late in the course of the disease. Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are two different mouse paramyxoviruses that historically have been very important as causes of murine respiratory disease in laboratory settings. Enteric parasitic infections are common in pet and wild mice. Good hygiene, good nutrition, and colony management can help to reduce the severity of signs seen because infections are transmitted by ingestion of eggs, infective cysts, or larvae found in the environment.
