AB  - Recent studies of the low abundant signaling lipid, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), reveal an intriguingly diverse list of downstream pathways, the intertwined relationship between PI(3,5)P2 and PI5P, as well as links to neurodegenerative diseases. Derived from the structural lipid phosphatidylinositol, PI(3,5)P2 is dynamically generated on multiple cellular compartments where interactions with an increasing list of effectors regulate many cellular pathways. A complex of proteins that includes Fab1/PIKfyve, Vac14, and Fig4/Sac3 mediates the biosynthesis of PI(3,5)P2, and mutations that disrupt complex function and/or formation cause profound consequences in cells. Surprisingly, mutations in this pathway are linked with neurological diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Future studies of PI(3,5)P2 and PI5P are likely to expand the roles of these lipids in regulation of cellular functions, as well as provide new approaches for treatment of some neurological diseases.

AB  - Practitioners working in limited resourced field conditions are often confronted with patients suffering from a myriad of exceptionally challenging medical conditions in the face of limited medical supplies and staff, as well as no options for referral. This chapter presents practical treatment protocols for commonly observed medical conditions based on accumulated field experience from veterinarians working in the field.

AB  - Summary Parenchyma is an important tissue in secondary xylem of seed plants, with functions ranging from storage to defence and with effects on the physical and mechanical properties of wood. Currently, we lack a large-scale quantitative analysis of ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) tissue fractions. Here, we use data from the literature on AP and RP fractions to investigate the potential relationships of climate and growth form with total ray and axial parenchyma fractions (RAP). We found a 29-fold variation in RAP fraction, which was more strongly related to temperature than with precipitation. Stem succulents had the highest RAP values (mean ± SD: 70.2 ± 22.0%), followed by lianas (50.1 ± 16.3%), angiosperm trees and shrubs (26.3 ± 12.4%), and conifers (7.6 ± 2.6%). Differences in RAP fraction between temperate and tropical angiosperm trees (21.1 ± 7.9% vs 36.2 ± 13.4%, respectively) are due to differences in the AP fraction, which is typically three times higher in tropical than in temperate trees, but not in RP fraction. Our results illustrate that both temperature and growth form are important drivers of RAP fractions. These findings should help pave the way to better understand the various functions of RAP in plants.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell implantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries. In a clinically relevant paradigm, however, the implantation of autologous Schwann cells is problematic and the use of heterogenetic Schwann cells will be required. In the present study we addressed this important issue and analysed the immunogenicity and survival of allogeneic and xenogeneic Schwann cell suspension grafts in a prelesioned CNS fiber tract, the transected postcommissural fornix of the adult Wistar rat. Cultured Schwann cells from Wistar rat or human peripheral nerve were injected either immediately or after a delay into the transection site and the spatio-temporal pattern of leukocyte infiltration and of major histocompatibility antigen expression was characterized and semiquantified with immunocytochemical methods. Our main findings are that (1) invasive cerebral lesions induce the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, but only sparse infiltration of T-lymphocytes, (2) both allogeneic and xenogeneic discordant Schwann cell suspension grafts, from either neonatal or adult peripheral nerve, survive without any overt signs of rejection for up to 10 weeks after implantation; and (3) delayed implantation procedures have no effect on immune responses to allogeneic Schwann cell grafts. These results demonstrate that there is no marked ongoing immune reactions to heterogenetic Schwann cell suspension grafts and that long-term survival of cross-species Schwann cell grafts can be achieved in the absence of any immunsuppressive treatment. Thus the conditions for functional transplantation of Schwann cells across immunological barriers seem to be favourable and will have implications for future cross-species studies, and possibly also for clinical application.

Incidence and clinical significance of bacterial and fungal contamination of the preservation solution in liver transplantation.?Transpl Infect Dis 2011: 13: 84?88. All rights reserved Abstract: A perfusion fluid used in the preservation of the grafted liver represents a medium suitable for microorganism growth. In this observational study, a sample of 232 transplanted livers was collected. Perfusion fluid samples were stored for microbiological analysis from harvested donors. Bacteria were isolated in 91 out of 232 samples, post-operative infections related to contaminated perfusion solution occurred in 13 cases. The contamination rate of the preservation medium appears to be high, but postoperative infections occurs rarely. We suggest periodic detection and a protocol in place designed for antibiotic use for transplanted patients exposed to contaminated perfusion solution.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2012) 18, 558?567 Objective:? To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. Materials and Methods:? Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV? and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA?DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann?Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. Results:? The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. Conclusions:? There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV? and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.

AB  - Background Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comes with a significant risk of life-threatening infection during periods of prolonged severe neutropenia. We studied the impact of preventive intravenous (IV) antibiotic administration at onset of absolute neutropenia on the incidence and outcome of life-threatening infections during treatment of childhood AML. Procedures This is a retrospective study on pediatric patients (aged 0?18 years) consecutively diagnosed with de novo AML and treated at a single institution from April 2005 through February 2013. Patients were treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0531 protocol or with a modified United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML 10 regimen. Pertinent data were extracted from hard copy or electronic chart review. Results A total of 76 chemotherapy phases were analyzed from 29 patients. In each phase reported, preventive antibiotics were initiated when the daily absolute neutrophil count was <500?cells/mcl, before onset of fever. Seven episodes of bacteremia were documented with predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci and viridans group streptococci. One infection-related death occurred, attributed to progressive respiratory failure occurring months after documented candidal pneumonia. Conclusions Initiation of preventive antibiotics at the onset of absolute neutropenia was associated with no mortality from bacteremia. This preventive approach appears feasible and safe.
