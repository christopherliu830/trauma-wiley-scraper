AB  - Summary Parenchyma is an important tissue in secondary xylem of seed plants, with functions ranging from storage to defence and with effects on the physical and mechanical properties of wood. Currently, we lack a large-scale quantitative analysis of ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) tissue fractions. Here, we use data from the literature on AP and RP fractions to investigate the potential relationships of climate and growth form with total ray and axial parenchyma fractions (RAP). We found a 29-fold variation in RAP fraction, which was more strongly related to temperature than with precipitation. Stem succulents had the highest RAP values (mean ± SD: 70.2 ± 22.0%), followed by lianas (50.1 ± 16.3%), angiosperm trees and shrubs (26.3 ± 12.4%), and conifers (7.6 ± 2.6%). Differences in RAP fraction between temperate and tropical angiosperm trees (21.1 ± 7.9% vs 36.2 ± 13.4%, respectively) are due to differences in the AP fraction, which is typically three times higher in tropical than in temperate trees, but not in RP fraction. Our results illustrate that both temperature and growth form are important drivers of RAP fractions. These findings should help pave the way to better understand the various functions of RAP in plants.

AB  - Abstract In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory properties of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as microglia activation and inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that NBP improved the locomotor recovery of SD rats after SCI an significantly diminished the lesion cavity area of the spinal cord, apoptotic activity in neurons, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells at 7 days post-injury. NBP inhibited activation of microglia, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and reduced the upregulation of microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression at 1 day post-injury. In a co-culture system with BV-2 cells and PC12 cells, NBP significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of BV-2 cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. In addition, NBP reduced the activation of BV-2 cells, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibited microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression in BV-2 cells. Our findings demonstrate that NBP may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of SCI by inhibiting the activation of microglia via TLR4/NF-?B signalling.

AB  - Summary Soil water and nutrient availability are key drivers of tree species distribution and forest ecosystem functioning, with strong species differences in water and nutrient use. Despite growing evidence for intraspecific trait differences, it remains unclear under which circumstances the effects of environmental gradients trump those of ontogeny and taxonomy on important functional dimensions related to resource use, particularly in tropical forests. Here, we explore how physiological, chemical, and morphological traits related to resource use vary between life stages in four species within the genus Micropholis that is widespread in lowland Amazonia. Specifically, we evaluate how environment, developmental stage, and taxonomy contribute to single-trait variation and multidimensional functional strategies. We find that environment, developmental stage, and taxonomy differentially contribute to functional dimensions. Habitats and seasons shape physiological and chemical traits related to water and nutrient use, whereas developmental stage and taxonomic identity impact morphological traits ?especially those related to the leaf economics spectrum. Our findings suggest that combining environment, ontogeny, and taxonomy allows for a better understanding of important functional dimensions in tropical trees and highlights the need for integrating tree physiological and chemical traits with classically used morphological traits to improve predictions of tropical forests? responses to environmental change.

AB  - Abstract Current wound healing treatments such as bandages and gauzes predominantly rely on passively protecting the wound and do not offer properties that increase the rate of wound healing. While these strategies are strong at protecting any infection after application, they are ineffective at treating an already infected wound or assisting in tissue regeneration. Next-generation wound healing treatments are being developed at a rapid pace and have a variety of advantages over traditional treatments. Features such as gas exchange, moisture balance, active suppression of infection, and increased cell proliferation are all central to developing the next successful wound healing dressing. Electrospinning has already been shown to have the qualities required to be a key technique of next generation polymer-based wound healing treatments. Combined with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), electrospun dressings can indeed become a formidable solution for the treatment of both acute and chronic wounds. The literature on combining electrospinning and AMPs is now starting to increase and this review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the current developments that combine electrospinning technology and AMPs in order to make multifunctional fibers effective against infection in wound healing.

AB  - Summary The advent of molecular genetic techniques and successful cell culture of the organism towards the end of the 20th century substantially accelerated the understanding of the causative organism, Tropheryma whipplei, and by extension, the underlying clinical condition. Whipple's disease usually is diagnosed at an advanced stage and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations. In classic Whipple's disease small-bowel biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. The effectiveness of antimicrobials, especially poorly absorbed antibiotics, as the mainstay for treating tropical sprue establishes the central role of enteric bacteria/bacterial overgrowth in the condition. Mycotic infections usually arise from disseminated pulmonary infections and occur usually, but not exclusively, in immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis for all mycotic infections of the small intestine is similar and includes other mycotic infections, Crohn's disease, tuberculosis (TB) enteritis, disseminated mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), bacterial typhlitis, intestinal ischemia and carcinoma.

AB  - Inflammation is a hallmark of virtually all liver diseases, such as liver cancer, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cholangiopathies. Liver macrophages have been thoroughly studied in human disease and mouse models, unravelling that the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system is more versatile and complex than previously believed. Liver macrophages mainly consist of liver-resident phagocytes, or Kupffer cells (KCs), and bone marrow-derived recruited monocytes. Although both cell populations in the liver demonstrate principal functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis, danger signal recognition, cytokine release, antigen processing, and the ability to orchestrate immune responses, KCs and recruited monocytes retain characteristic ontogeny markers and remain remarkably distinct on several functional aspects. While KCs dominate the hepatic macrophage pool in homeostasis (?sentinel function?), monocyte-derived macrophages prevail in acute or chronic injury (?emergency response team?), making them an interesting target for novel therapeutic approaches in liver disease. In addition, recent data acquired by unbiased large-scale techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, unraveled a previously unrecognized complexity of human and murine macrophage polarization abilities, far beyond the old dogma of inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite tremendous progress, numerous challenges remain in deciphering the full spectrum of macrophage activation and its implication in either promoting liver disease progression or repairing injured liver tissue. Being aware of such heterogeneity in cell origin and function is of crucial importance when studying liver diseases, developing novel therapeutic interventions, defining macrophage-based prognostic biomarkers, or designing clinical trials. Growing knowledge in gene expression modulation and emerging technologies in drug delivery may soon allow shaping macrophage populations toward orchestrating beneficial rather than detrimental inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Alopecia may occur anywhere on the body of guinea pigs. Skin scrapings, biopsies, histopathology, special histologic staining, and fungal or microbiologic culturing are all suitable ancillary techniques for determining an etiologic basis for suspected infectious causes of alopecia in guinea pigs. Animal housing and management practices should be evaluated closely in simple cases of alopecia, looking for potential sources of abrasions or rough surfaces in which hair may be caught. Adequacy of diet should be ascertained, particularly with respect to vitamin C content. There are few published reports of neurologic disorders in guinea pigs. Head tilt, circling, and head shaking may be seen with bacterial infections of the middle and inner ear. Cataracts with or without nuclear sclerosis are common findings in guinea pigs and may invol.
