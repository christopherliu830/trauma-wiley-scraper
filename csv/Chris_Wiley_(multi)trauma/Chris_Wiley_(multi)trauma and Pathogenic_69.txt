AB  - Abstract This unit discusses an approach to identifying a genetic etiology in an individual with nonsyndromic hearing loss. The unit begins with a discussion of the decision-making process that can be used to determine whether specific genes and/or a large gene panel should be used for molecular diagnosis of a patient presenting with nonsyndromic hearing loss. Next, two protocols are presented: (1) a full gene-sequencing assay to identify mutations in the GJB2 gene (encoding connexin 26), the most common cause of congenital hearing loss, and (2) an assay to detect the presence of the GJB6-D13S1830 deletion, a 342-kb deletion that causes hearing loss in homozygosity or in combination with a single GJB2 mutation. Finally, the unit ends with a strategy for determining the clinical significance of the test results, which can be challenging given the extensive genetic heterogeneity associated with hearing loss.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - SUMMARY Treatment by injection or infusion is widespread in China. Using the common cold as a tracer condition, we explored the reasons for over-prescription of injections and infusions in Guizhou, China. Interviews with prescribers, patients and key informants were supplemented by focus groups. These revealed how historical ideas encourage unnecessary use of percutaneous treatment: faith in the healing power of needles is locally attributed to association with acupuncture. Many patients and some staff believe that injections per se are therapeutic. However, the structure of health service financing and remuneration now reinforces this irrational faith. Market-based reforms have attempted to control costs and increase productivity with an incentive scheme which rewards prescribers financially for over-prescription in general and for use of injections and infusions in particular. Aggressive marketing has displaced oral treatment from health facilities into independent pharmacies, leaving doctors functioning mainly as injection providers. There is a need for a multi-faceted response encompassing education and reform of financial incentives to reduce the use of unnecessary treatment. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The hypermobile type of Ehlers?Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is likely the most common hereditary disorder of connective tissue. It has been described largely in those with musculoskeletal complaints including joint hypermobility, joint subluxations/dislocations, as well as skin and soft tissue manifestations. Many patients report activity-related pain and some go on to have daily pain. Two undifferentiated syndromes have been used to describe these manifestations?joint hypermobility syndrome and hEDS. Both are clinical diagnoses in the absence of other causation. Current medical literature further complicates differentiation and describes multiple associated symptoms and disorders. The current EDS nosology combines these two entities into the hypermobile type of EDS. Herein, we review and summarize the literature as a better clinical description of this type of connective tissue disorder. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Kindlin-1 is an epithelium-specific phosphoprotein and focal adhesion adaptor component. Mutations in the corresponding gene (KIND1) cause Kindler syndrome (KS), which is manifested by skin blistering, poikiloderma, photosensitivity and carcinogenesis. Some patients also exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, but it has remained unclear whether these represent a feature of Kindler syndrome or a coincidence. We examined kindlin-1 in human gastrointestinal epithelia and showed that it is involved in the aetiopathology of Kindler syndrome-associated colitis. Kindlin-1 expression was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, western blot and RT?PCR. Kindlin-1 is expressed in oral mucosa, colon and rectum. Both the full-length 74 kDa kindlin-1 protein and a 43 kDa isoform were detected in CaCo2 cells, the latter resulting from alternative splicing. In the first months of life, patients (homozygous for null mutations) had severe intestinal involvement with haemorrhagic diarrhoea and showed morphological features of severe ulcerative colitis. Later in childhood, histopathology demonstrated focal detachment of the epithelium in all segments of the colon, chronic inflammation and mucosal atrophy. These findings define an intestinal phenotype for Kindler syndrome as a consequence of a primary epithelial barrier defect. The different clinical intestinal manifestations in Kindler syndrome patients may be explained by partial functional compensation of kindlin-1 deficiency by the intestinal isoform or by the presence of truncated mutant kindlin-1.

AB  - Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis is characterized by recurrent crops of tender edematous nodules on the lower legs. lobular panniculitis with granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, focal necrosis and septal fibrosis is present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been detected in some lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cases of erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis were found. H & E stained slides were reviewed. PCR assays for M tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was carried out. PCR did not reveal mycobacterial DNA, with positive controls indicating the reliability of the assays. Among the MOTT, cutaneous infections are most commonly caused by M. marinum. Subcutaneous tuberculoid granulomas may be seen with M. kansaii, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. avium complex. M. gordonae and M. malmoense rarely cause cutaneous infections. M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gastri and M. asiaticum are probably not cutaneous pathogens. MOTT DNA was not found? in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis. Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis has diverse etiologies with varying pathogeneses leading to similar histologic changes. The cases analyzed may have not have had an infectious etiology. However, in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis, performance of? PCR for MOTT as well as Mycobacteria tuberculosis complex may still be beneficial, particularly in cases from immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the literature documenting the existence of bacterial translocation in humans, the effects of enteral nutrition on bacterial translocation in humans, and the hypothesis that enteral nutrition prevents bacterial translocation in humans. Data Identification: Sources included Medline search, references from review articicles, and references from animal and human studies. Study selection: The goal was to include all animal and human studies directly addressing questions of bacterial translocation and nutritional status or nutritional support. Data Extraction: An attempt was made to briefly summarize methodology and findings of relevent studies. No general attempt was made to assess quality of individual studies. Results of Data Synthesis: Bacterial translocation is a well documented phenomenon in animal models. Starvation and malnutrition of themselves do not induce bacterial translocation, but may facilitate translocation in the presence of other systemic insults. Parenteral nutrition and many forms of enteral nutrition may induce and/or facilitate bacterial translocation. Chow and certain fiber sources seem protective. Moderate direct and several lines of indirect evidence support the existence of bacterial translocation in humans. There is no direct evidence and questionable indirect evidence suggesting that enteral nutrition prevents or modifies bacterial translocation in humans. Conclusions: The hypothesis relating enteral nutrition and bacterial translocation in critically ill patients remains attractive, but unproven.

AB  - The eye is a highly specialized organ that is subject to a huge range of pathology. Both local and systemic disease may affect different anatomical regions of the eye. The least invasive routes for ocular drug administration are topical (e.g. eye drops) and systemic (e.g. tablets) formulations. Barriers that subserve as protection against pathogen entry also restrict drug permeation. Topically administered drugs often display limited bioavailability due to many physical and biochemical barriers including the pre-corneal tear film, the structure and biophysiological properties of the cornea, the limited volume that can be accommodated by the cul-de-sac, the lacrimal drainage system and reflex tearing. The tissue layers of the cornea and conjunctiva are further key factors that act to restrict drug delivery. Using carriers that enhance viscosity or bind to the ocular surface increases bioavailability. Matching the pH and polarity of drug molecules to the tissue layers allows greater penetration. Drug delivery to the posterior segment is a greater challenge and, currently, the standard route is via intravitreal injection, notwithstanding the risks of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment with frequent injections. Intraocular implants that allow sustained drug release are at different stages of development. Novel exciting therapeutic approaches include methods for promoting transscleral delivery, sustained release devices, nanotechnology and gene therapy.
