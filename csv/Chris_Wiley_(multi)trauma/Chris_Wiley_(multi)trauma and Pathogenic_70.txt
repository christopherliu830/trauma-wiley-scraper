AB  - Abstract Objective To test the association between workplace abuse exposure and injury risk among hospital workers. We hypothesized that exposed workers would have higher injury rates than unexposed workers. Methods Survey of direct-care workers (n?=?1,497) in two hospitals. Exposure to workplace abuse was assessed through self-report; occupational injury reports were extracted from employee records. We tested associations between non-physical workplace violence and injury using log-binomial regression and multilevel modeling. Results Adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for injury associated with being yelled at was 1.52 (95% CI 1.19, 1.95); for experiencing hostile/offensive gestures 1.43 (1.11, 1.82); and for being sworn at 1.41 (1.09, 1.81). In analyses by injury subtypes, musculoskeletal injuries were more strongly associated with abuse than were acute traumatic injuries. Associations operated on group and individual levels and were most consistently associated with abuse perpetrated by patients. Conclusion Exposure to workplace abuse may be a risk factor for injuries among hospital workers. Am. J. Ind. Med. 57:222?232, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Disorders of the respiratory system are a common presentation in reptile patients. Captive and wild animals have been reported with a variety of respiratory tract lesions. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites are the most common aetiologies. Although some microbes can act as primary pathogens, most infections are a result of incompetence of the immune system, often associated with husbandry and nutrition.

AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives To explore aspects that promote and challenge long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower. Background Considerable research has been devoted to ICU patients? experiences; however, research on long-term ICU patients is limited. Studies in a health-promoting perspective focusing on long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower are scarce. Design A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, using in-depth interviews. Methods Seventeen long-term Norwegian ICU patients were interviewed once, at 6?18 months after ICU discharge. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was used (Data S1). Results The lived experience of the phenomenon ?inner strength and willpower? and what promotes and challenges this phenomenon in long-term ICU patients were represented by four main themes and nine subthemes. Promoting aspects comprised of two main themes and five subthemes: (a) ?No doubt about coming back to life? with subthemes; ?Strong connectedness to life; feeling alive and present,? ?Meaning and purpose; feeling valuable to somebody.? (b) ?How to ignite and maintain the spark of life,? with the subthemes: ?Practical solutions, coping skills from previous life experiences,? ?Provocative and inspiring experiences? and ?Vivid dream experiences that ignite the willpower.? Two main categories and four subcategories represented challenging aspects: (a) Exhaustion, weakness and discomfort; subthemes; ?Physical challenges? and ?Mental discomfort? and (b) ?Tiring delusions,? subthemes; ?Living in the worst horror movie? and ?Feeling trapped.? Conclusion This study expands on previous studies by providing insights about what promotes and challenges long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower during their recovery trajectory. Relevance to clinical practice Insights into the variety of long-term ICU patients? experiences during the recovery trajectory are important for ICU nurses to support and facilitate ICU patients? inner strength and willpower.

AB  - Summary Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are an increasingly common complication in critically ill patients in Europe and are frequently fatal. Because of changes in treatment strategies and the increased use of antifungal prophylaxis, the epidemiology of IFDs has changed substantially in recent years and infections due to Candida species are no longer the majority in many institutions. In contrast, the emergence of non-Candida IFDs such as aspergillosis, zygomycosis and fusariosis has increased. European surveys indicate that Candida albicans is responsible for more than half the cases of invasive candidaemia; however, the occurrence of non-albicans-related IFDs appears to be increasing. Rates of IFD-related mortality in Europe depend on the pathogen, geographical location and underlying patient characteristics, with rates ranging from 28 to 59% for Candida infections and from 38 to 80% for invasive aspergillosis. Early initiation of antifungal therapy is critical for improving outcomes; however, this is complicated by the difficulty in diagnosing IFDs rapidly and accurately. The introduction of new extended-spectrum azole antifungal agents (e.g. voriconazole, posaconazole) and echinocandins (e.g. micafungin, caspofungin, anidulafungin) has increased the number of therapeutic options for early therapy. Choice between agents should be based on a variety of factors, including spectrum of activity, adverse events, drug interactions, route of administration, clinical efficacy of individual agents and local epidemiology.

AB  - Summary While T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis for more than three decades, the focus on the T helper type 17 (Th17) subset of CD4 T cells and their secreted cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, is much more recent. Proinflammatory actions of IL-17 were first identified in the 1990s, but the delineation of a distinct Th17 subset in late 2005 has sparked great interest in the role of these cells in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. This review summarizes current understanding of the role of Th17 cells and their products in both animal models of inflammatory arthritis and human immune-driven arthritides.
