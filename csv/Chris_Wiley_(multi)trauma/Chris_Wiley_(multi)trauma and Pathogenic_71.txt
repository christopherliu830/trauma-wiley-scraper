AB  - Abstract Purpose To determine predictors of secondary glaucoma and poor visual outcome in children undergoing cataract surgery with bag-in-the-lens (BIL)-IOL implantation. Methods Medical records were retrospectively analysed for children with primary implantation with BIL-IOL during 2009?2013. Results The study included 109 eyes. Median age at surgery was 2.5 years (range 2 weeks?14.1 years), 26.6% being ≤12 weeks of age (= early group). Median follow-up time was 2.8 years (7 months-5.8 years). 15 eyes (13.8%) developed glaucoma, 14 (48.3%) in the early group and 1 (1.3%) in the late group (p < 0.001). Within the early group, mean time for surgery differed significantly. Patients developing glaucoma had cataract surgery at 3.5 ± 1.1 weeks (mean ± SD) and the non-glaucoma patients at 5.7 ± 3.3 weeks (p = 0.024). In the entire cohort, 21 eyes (19.3%) had conditions associated with glaucoma; 57.1% of these developed glaucoma compared to 3.4% without these conditions (p < 0.001). Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (decimal) of ≥0.5 was seen in 50 eyes (48.5%), median 0.63 in the late group and 0.15 in the early group. Glaucoma eyes in the early group (surgery at 3.5 weeks) achieved 0.56 median (range, 0.4?1.0) logMAR, (0.28 decimal) CDVA, whereas non-glaucoma eyes (surgery at 5.7 weeks) achieved 0.89 median (range 0.7?1.6) logMAR (0.13 decimal) CDVA; p = 0.016. Glaucoma development in infants between 5 weeks and 2 years of age was 6.7% (n = 2/30). Conclusions Comorbidity strongly increases the risk of secondary glaucoma. Surgery during the first month is correlated with better CDVA outcome and glaucoma. After 5 weeks of age, glaucoma rate is low with the BIL-IOL.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT? ??It is well known that tobramycin given as an once daily dose according to the usual recommendations needs therapeutic drug monitoring by measurement of peak and trough concentrations. In the literature, there are only few published studies on the population pharmacokinetics of once daily tobramycin in critically ill patients. Glomerular filtration rate and bodyweight were identified as covariates contributing to the inter-individual variability in the disposition of aminoglycosides. The study, by Peris-Marti et?al. [24], only evaluated the pharmacodynamic effectiveness of a 4?mg?kg?1 dose of tobramycin given once daily in critically ill patients. The authors concluded with a simulation showing that for a theoretical MIC of 1 or 2?mg?l?1, a 7?mg?kg?1 dose was required. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS? ??Our results confirm the high variability of tobramycin disposition in intensive care patients and consequently the possible lack of effectiveness. ??By using a population pharmacokinetic approach, two explicative covariates (height and Cockcroft creatinine clearance) added to a two-compartment model with proportional error, explained much of the inter-individual variability of tobramycin disposition in the critically ill patient population. ??In a median ICU patient, simulations were performed at various dosage regimens and peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Drug monitoring is required to manage efficacy and toxicity. AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the disposition of tobramycin (TOB) in critically ill patients (ICU) by a population pharmacokinetic approach, to determine the covariates involved, and to simulate tobramycin dosage regimens. METHODS Forty-nine adult ICU patients received TOB (5?mg?kg?1) once daily. NonMem modelling was performed on 32 patients. The 17 other patients were used for the qualification process by normalized prediction distribution error. Then Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed. RESULTS A two-compartment model with a proportional error best fitted the data. TOB total clearance (CLTOB) was significantly correlated with Cockcroft creatinine clearance (COCK) and height. TOB clearance was 4.8 ± 1.9?l?h?1 (range 1.22?8.95), the volume of distribution of the central compartment was 24.7 ± 3.7?l (range 17.34?32.83) and that of the peripheral compartment and the inter-compartmental clearance were 30.6?l and 4.74?l?h?1, respectively. Only 29% of the patients presented a target AUC between 80 and 125?mg?l?1?h and 61% were lower than 80?mg?l?1?h. After considering COCK and height, MCS showed that only 50% of the population could achieve the target AUC for the 375 and 400?mg dosages. CONCLUSION Even after taking into account COCK and height, for strains with an MIC ≤ 1?mg?l?1, MCS doses evidenced that peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Combination therapy in addition to drug monitoring are required to manage efficacy and toxicity.

AB  - Summary Worldwide, the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has shown a significant increase in recent years. In Germany, this circumstance is reflected by a rise in the number of reported syphilis cases. There has also been an uptick in the incidence of non-notifiable STIs such as gonorrhea and infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A key factor in the spread of these infections is their varied clinical presentation, which includes urogenital, pharyngeal and rectal involvement as well as a large number of asymptomatic cases. New real-time multiplex PCR methods allow for rapid and targeted detection of STI pathogens. The most common bacterial STI is urogenital chlamydial infection caused by serovars D?K, which affects young adults in particular. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by L serovars often presents as chlamydial proctitis. In recent years, Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae has shown a significant development of resistance, with high-level monoresistance and multiresistance to antibiotics commonly used for treatment. It is therefore imperative that sensitivity testing of N. gonorrhoeae be performed in addition to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Increased drug resistance has also been observed for Mycoplasma genitalium, a fact that complicates treatment.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Abstract This 12-week, prospective, randomised, controlled multi-centre study compared the proportion of healed diabetic foot ulcers and mean healing time between patients receiving acellular matrix (AM) (study group) and standard of care (control group) therapies. Eighty-six patients were randomised into study (47 patients) and control (39 patients) groups. No significant differences in demographics or pre-treatment ulcer data were calculated. Complete healing and mean healing time were 69·6% and 5·7?weeks, respectively, for the study group and 46·2% and 6·8 weeks, respectively, for the control group. The proportion of healed ulcers between the groups was statistically significant (P?=?0·0289), with odds of healing in the study group 2·7 times higher than in the control group. Kaplan?Meier survivorship analysis for time to complete healing at 12?weeks showed a significantly higher non healing rate (P?=?0·015) for the control group (53·9%) compared with the study group (30·4%). After adjusting for ulcer size at presentation, which was a statistically significant covariate (P?=?0·0194), a statistically significant difference in non healing rate between groups was calculated (P?=?0·0233), with odds of healing 2·0 times higher in the study versus control group. This study supports the use of single-application AM therapy as an effective treatment of diabetic, neuropathic ulcers.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.
