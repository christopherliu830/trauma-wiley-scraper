AB  - Abstract This 12-week, prospective, randomised, controlled multi-centre study compared the proportion of healed diabetic foot ulcers and mean healing time between patients receiving acellular matrix (AM) (study group) and standard of care (control group) therapies. Eighty-six patients were randomised into study (47 patients) and control (39 patients) groups. No significant differences in demographics or pre-treatment ulcer data were calculated. Complete healing and mean healing time were 69·6% and 5·7?weeks, respectively, for the study group and 46·2% and 6·8 weeks, respectively, for the control group. The proportion of healed ulcers between the groups was statistically significant (P?=?0·0289), with odds of healing in the study group 2·7 times higher than in the control group. Kaplan?Meier survivorship analysis for time to complete healing at 12?weeks showed a significantly higher non healing rate (P?=?0·015) for the control group (53·9%) compared with the study group (30·4%). After adjusting for ulcer size at presentation, which was a statistically significant covariate (P?=?0·0194), a statistically significant difference in non healing rate between groups was calculated (P?=?0·0233), with odds of healing 2·0 times higher in the study versus control group. This study supports the use of single-application AM therapy as an effective treatment of diabetic, neuropathic ulcers.

AB  - Summary The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and fetal losses. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), particularly against the phospholipid binding protein beta-2 glycoprotein I (?2GPI), play an important role in APS pathological mechanisms. aPL can activate intracellular signal transduction in a ?2GPI-dependent manner to induce inflammatory responses, and promote hypercoagulable state and recurrent spontaneous abortion when ?2GPI is associated with the cell surface receptor. In vivo and in vitro studies show that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is the high affinity receptor that connects ?2GPI to the target cells. However, ANXA2 is not a transmembrane protein and lacks an intracellular signal transduction pathway. Growing evidences suggest that the transmembrane protein toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) might act as an ?adaptor? for intracellular signal transduction. This review focuses on the role of TLR4 and its signalling pathway in APS pathological mechanisms which will help us better understand the pathological processes of this syndrome.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - Abstract Whilst the importance of mutations in a wide range of keratins in skin fragility disorders is now well established, there is much less evidence for simple epithelial keratin involvement in disease. Some simple epithelial keratin mutations have been reported in liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis patients, and recently mutations in the simple epithelial keratin K8 were identified in a group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis). In comparison with the mutations seen in epidermal keratins, these simple epithelial mutations would be predicted to have mild consequences, although analysis shows that they do have a distinct effect. This review article discusses the evidence that these mutations are a predisposing factor for inflammatory bowel disease. Copyright ? 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - Summary The zoonotic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii infects over 30% of the human population. The intracellular parasite can persist lifelong in the CNS within neurons modifying their function and structure, thus leading to specific behavioural changes of the host. In recent years, several in vitro studies and murine models have focused on the elucidation of these modifications. Furthermore, investigations of the human population have correlated Toxoplasma seropositivity with changes in neurological functions; however, the complex underlying mechanisms of the subtle behavioural alteration are still not fully understood. The parasites are able to induce direct modifications in the infected cells, for example by altering dopamine metabolism, by functionally silencing neurons as well as by hindering apoptosis. Moreover, indirect effects of the peripheral immune system and alterations of the immune status of the CNS, observed during chronic infection, might also contribute to changes in neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity. In this review, we will provide an overview and highlight recent advances, which describe changes in the neuronal function and morphology upon T. gondii infection.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Information from the genes encoding factor VIII (F8) and IX (F9) is used in reproductive planning and to inform inhibitor formation, bleeding severity and response to therapies. Advances in technology and our understanding of the human genome now allows more comprehensive methods to study genomic variation and its impact on haemophilia. Aims The My Life Our Future (MLOF) programme was begun in 2012 to provide genetic analysis and to expand research in haemophilia through a research repository. Methods MLOF enrolled haemophilia A and B patients followed at haemophilia treatment centers in the U.S., including, since 2015, known and potential genetic carriers. Initial F8 and F9 DNA analysis was performed utilizing a next generation sequencing approach which allowed simultaneous detection of F8 inversions and other variants. Candidate variants were confirmed using a second method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to detect structural variants. Results The initial phase of MLOF completed enrollment in December 2017 with 11,356 patients, genetic carriers, and potential carriers enrolled. In the 9453 subjects in whom analysis is complete, 687 unique previously unreported variants were found. Simultaneous sequencing of the F8 and F9 genes resulted in identification of non-deleterious variants previously reported as causative in haemophilia. DNA from 5141 MLOF subjects has undergone whole genome sequencing through the NHLBI TOPMed programme of the U.S. NIH. Conclusion MLOF has provided genetic information for patients and their families to help inform clinical care and has established a repository of data and biospecimens to further advance haemophilia research.
