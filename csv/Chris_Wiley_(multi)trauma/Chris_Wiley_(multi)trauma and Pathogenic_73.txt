AB  - Abstract Introduction Information from the genes encoding factor VIII (F8) and IX (F9) is used in reproductive planning and to inform inhibitor formation, bleeding severity and response to therapies. Advances in technology and our understanding of the human genome now allows more comprehensive methods to study genomic variation and its impact on haemophilia. Aims The My Life Our Future (MLOF) programme was begun in 2012 to provide genetic analysis and to expand research in haemophilia through a research repository. Methods MLOF enrolled haemophilia A and B patients followed at haemophilia treatment centers in the U.S., including, since 2015, known and potential genetic carriers. Initial F8 and F9 DNA analysis was performed utilizing a next generation sequencing approach which allowed simultaneous detection of F8 inversions and other variants. Candidate variants were confirmed using a second method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to detect structural variants. Results The initial phase of MLOF completed enrollment in December 2017 with 11,356 patients, genetic carriers, and potential carriers enrolled. In the 9453 subjects in whom analysis is complete, 687 unique previously unreported variants were found. Simultaneous sequencing of the F8 and F9 genes resulted in identification of non-deleterious variants previously reported as causative in haemophilia. DNA from 5141 MLOF subjects has undergone whole genome sequencing through the NHLBI TOPMed programme of the U.S. NIH. Conclusion MLOF has provided genetic information for patients and their families to help inform clinical care and has established a repository of data and biospecimens to further advance haemophilia research.

AB  - ABSTRACT The majority of periprosthetic joint infections occur shortly after primary joint replacement (<3 months) and require the removal of all implant components for the treatment period (~4 months). A clinically relevant animal model of periprosthetic infection should, therefore, establish an infection with implant components in place. Here, we describe a joint replacement model in the rat with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium components inoculated at the time of surgery by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is one of the main causative microorganisms of periprosthetic joint infections. We monitored the animals for 4 weeks by measuring gait, weight-bearing symmetry, von Frey testing, and micro-CT as our primary endpoint analyses. We also assessed the infection ex vivo using colony counts on the implant surfaces and histology of the surrounding tissues. The results confirmed the presence of a local infection for 4 weeks with osteolysis, loosening of the implants, and clinical infection indicators such as redness, swelling, and increased temperature. The utility of specific gait analysis parameters, especially temporal symmetry, hindlimb duty factor imbalance, and phase dispersion was identified in this model for assessing the longitudinal progression of the infection, and these metrics correlated with weight-bearing asymmetry. We propose to use this model to study the efficacy of using different local delivery regimens of antimicrobials on addressing periprosthetic joint infections. Statement of clinical significance: We have established a preclinical joint surgery model, in which postoperative recovery can be monitored over a multi-week course by assessing gait, weight-bearing, and allodynia. This model can be used to study the efficacy of different combinations of implant materials and medication regimens. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of an endodontic infection on periodontal probing depth and presence of furcation involvement in periodontally-involved mandibular molars. All first and second mandibular molars in 100 patients were selected if at least one was root-filled or had a possible periapical radiolucency. The sample consisted of patients from a referral population at a periodontal clinic which represented an adult population with a mean age between 50 and 60 years. For mandibular molars with periapical destruction at both roots, mean periodontal probing depth was significantly greater compared to teeth without periapical destruction. Horizontal furcation depths â‰¥3 mm were significantly more frequent at mandibular molars with periapical destruction. It is suggested that a root canal infection in periodontitis-involved molars may potentiate periodontitis progression by spreading of endodontic pathogens through patent accessory canals and dentinal tubules. In conclusion, an endodontic infection in mandibular molars was found to be associated with additional attachment loss in the furcation area, and may thus be considered to be one of several risk factors influencing the prognosis of molars in periodontitis-prone patients.

AB  - SUMMARY The decision of whether a cell should live or die is fundamental for the wellbeing of all organisms. Despite intense investigation into cell growth and proliferation, only recently has the essential and equally important idea that cells control/programme their own demise for proper maintenance of cellular homeostasis gained recognition. Furthermore, even though research into programmed cell death (PCD) has been an extremely active area of research there are significant gaps in our understanding of the process in plants. In this review, we discuss PCD during plant development and pathogenesis, and compare/contrast this with mammalian apoptosis.

AB  - The effectiveness of four antiseptics representing soluble phenolics (Dettol), Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QAC) (Dettol Hospital Concentrate: DHC), mixed QAC/chlorhexidine (Hibicet Hospital Concentrate: HHC) and povidone iodine (Betadine) was assessed using the proposed phase 2 step 1 European Suspension test. The in vitro activity of the antiseptics against two of the proposed challenge strains, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was compared with that of 14 problematic clinical isolates of bacteria from a range of genera, including some multiple antibiotic resistant strains, and a clinical isolate of Candida albicans. In addition to the 5 min contact time recommended in the European test, a 1 min time was included. All four products, at their recommended use dilutions and a contact time of 5 min, achieved a Microbicidal Effect (ME) log reduction of at least 5 against the majority of organisms. Differences in activity between products were more pronounced and therefore the tests more discriminatory, when the contact time was reduced to 1 min. The clinical strains were not overtly more resistant to antiseptics than the standard test strains, suggesting that the CEN test strains mimic the antiseptic susceptibility of clinical isolates.

AB  - Abstract Psychological models of mental disorders guide research into psychological and environmental factors that elicit and maintain mental disorders as well as interventions to reduce them. This paper addresses four areas. (1) Psychological models of mental disorders have become increasingly transdiagnostic, focusing on core cognitive endophenotypes of psychopathology from an integrative cognitive psychology perspective rather than offering explanations for unitary mental disorders. It is argued that psychological interventions for mental disorders will increasingly target specific cognitive dysfunctions rather than symptom-based mental disorders as a result. (2) Psychotherapy research still lacks a comprehensive conceptual framework that brings together the wide variety of findings, models and perspectives. Analysing the state-of-the-art in psychotherapy treatment research, ?component analyses? aiming at an optimal identification of core ingredients and the mechanisms of change is highlighted as the core need towards improved efficacy and effectiveness of psychotherapy, and improved translation to routine care. (3) In order to provide more effective psychological interventions to children and adolescents, there is a need to develop new and/or improved psychotherapeutic interventions on the basis of developmental psychopathology research taking into account knowledge of mediators and moderators. Developmental neuroscience research might be instrumental to uncover associated aberrant brain processes in children and adolescents with mental health problems and to better examine mechanisms of their correction by means of psychotherapy and psychological interventions. (4) Psychotherapy research needs to broaden in terms of adoption of large-scale public health strategies and treatments that can be applied to more patients in a simpler and cost-effective way. Increased research on efficacy and moderators of Internet-based treatments and e-mental health tools (e.g. to support ?real time? clinical decision-making to prevent treatment failure or relapse) might be one promising way forward.

AB  - Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is commonly used in combination with the installment of titanium implants. The application of a membrane to exclude non-osteogenic tissues from interfering with bone regeneration is a key principle of GBR. Membrane materials possess a number of properties which are amenable to modification. A large number of membranes have been introduced for experimental and clinical verification. This prompts the need for an update on membrane properties and the biological outcomes, as well as a critical assessment of the biological mechanisms governing bone regeneration in defects covered by membranes. The relevant literature for this narrative review was assessed after a MEDLINE/PubMed database search. Experimental data suggest that different modifications of the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes may promote bone regeneration. Nevertheless, the precise role of membrane porosities for the barrier function of GBR membranes still awaits elucidation. Novel experimental findings also suggest an active role of the membrane compartment per se in promoting the regenerative processes in the underlying defect during GBR, instead of being purely a passive barrier. The optimization of membrane materials by systematically addressing both the barrier and the bioactive properties is an important strategy in this field of research.

AB  - Summary Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most important systemic mycosis in Latin America. It has been regarded as a multifocal disease, with oral lesions as the prominent feature. To provide useful information concerning the diagnosis and management of the disease, this study describes demographic and clinical data from the medical records of a consecutive series of 66 Brazilian patients from an endemic area, evaluated in a referral centre for oral diagnosis. In this sample of patients, there was a predominance of middle-aged male patients, who were primarily rural workers. Chronic multifocal disease was prevalent, with lesions also detected in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin or adrenal glands. Most of the cases presented with lesions at the gingival mucosa followed by the palate and lips; these conditions occurring in the oral cavity were frequently associated with pain. Importantly, most of the patients sought professional care for oral lesions. The diagnosis was obtained through exfoliative cytology and/or biopsy of the oral lesions. Medical treatment was effective, and there were no mortalities in the sample. The present findings not only confirm the importance of oral lesions in the diagnosis and management of PCM but also illustrate that questions still remain unclear, such as the possibility of direct inoculation of the fungus onto oral tissues.
