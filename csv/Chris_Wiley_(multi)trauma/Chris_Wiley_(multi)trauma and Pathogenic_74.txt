AB  - Summary Ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for influenza virus research, as well as other disease conditions, such as Helicobacter-induced gastropathy. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a distinct idiopathic inflammatory condition of young adult ferrets. Affected animals may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, and a marked eosinophilia may be noted during routine hematologic evaluation. Hematologic changes may include nonregenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses for hypergammaglobulinemia and/or abdominal masses include Aleutian disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic infection (e.g., proliferative colitis, helicobacteriosis), idiopathic splenomegaly, multiple myeloma, other neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis are seen sporadically in ferrets. Similarly, systemic viral disease caused by infection with canine distemper virus, influenza virus, Aleutian disease (a parvovirus infection), and coronavirus may induce foci of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Nonspecific lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis may be seen with moderate regularity in surgical biopsies or tissue sections from adult ferrets as an extension of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews what has changed in the treatment of furcation-involved teeth in recent years. It presents the evidence for the efficacy of the new therapeutic modalities. The periodontal endoscope has been specifically designed to explore and visualize periodontal pockets in patients with periodontitis. In periodontal therapy, different lasers have been proposed for removal of pocket epithelium, removal of subgingival calculus deposits, reduction of bacterial, root surface decontamination, and enhancement of periodontal regeneration. Adverse events and risk of developing antibiotic resistance should be an important concern when deciding whether to use adjunctive antibiotic therapy. Its characteristics make photodynamic therapy (PDT) potentially suitable for the treatment of periodontitis, either in the non-surgical or surgical phase, with the aim of boosting the antimicrobial effects of mechanical plaque removal without the risk of causing microbial resistance. Air-polishing devices might represent a valid alternative to mechanical instrumentation, for both periodontal treatment and periodontal maintenance therapy.

AB  - Abstract This is a review of the common pathogens of surgical site infections, antibiotic coverage for particular anatomical sites, mechanisms by which surgical site infections occur and the latest data and recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of surgical site infections, infective endocarditis and haematogenous joint infections. Recent evidence-based guidelines on surgical prophylaxis is for restricted indications and a shorter duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in situations where no clinical benefit of prolonged therapy has been proven, in order to minimise the potential adverse ecological and clinical effects associated with antibiotic therapy. This review recommends the cautious use of prophylactic antibiotics in dermatological surgery to help prevent the growing problem of bacterial resistance as well as other morbidity and health-care costs.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387¬†330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - summary. Data of the German Haemovigilance System were collected from 1997 to 2007 and assessed on the basis of pre-defined safety standards. Suspected cases of serious adverse reactions following transfusions reported to the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut were evaluated on the basis of national criteria, and the definitions of International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) in compliance with defined causality criteria. The suspected cases were rated as confirmed and unconfirmed transfusion reactions. Assessment of causality took into consideration the clinical course of the adverse reaction and, if necessary, information about donation and manufacturing. Of the 5128 suspected serious adverse reactions, 1603 could be confirmed. Referring to the absolute figures, acute transfusion reactions (e.g. allergic reactions, hypotension and dyspnoea) were recorded most frequently, followed by transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), haemolytic reactions, transfusion-related bacterial infections and virus infections. The majority of the 52 transfusion-related fatalities (14 each) were due to TRALI and acute transfusion reactions (mostly severe allergic reactions). Referred to the blood products administered, immune TRALI cases and TRALI-related fatal courses were most frequently reported after administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (15/106 and 3.5/106 units, respectively), transfusion-related bacterial infections after administration of platelet concentrates (7/106 units), acute haemolytic transfusion reactions after administration of red blood cell concentrates (2.3/106units) and acute transfusion reactions after administration of red blood cell or platelet concentrates (7.8/106 and 13/106 units, respectively). Despite the high safety standard required for blood products in Germany, there is still room for reducing the frequency of isolated cases of transfusion reactions by targeted action.

AB  - Introduction Many infectious diseases display seasonal variation corresponding with particular conditions. In orthopaedics a growing body of evidence has identified surges in post-operative infection rates during higher temperature periods. The aim of this research was to collate and synthesize the current literature on this topic. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using five databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and Central (Cochrane)). Study quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from monthly infection rates and a pooled OR was generated using the DerSimonian and Lairds method. A protocol for this review was registered with the National Institute for Health Research International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42017081871). Results Eighteen studies analysing over 19?000 cases of orthopaedic related infection met inclusion criteria. Data on 6620 cases and 9035 controls from 12 studies were included for meta-analysis. The pooled OR indicated an overall increased odds of post-operative infection for patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures during warmer periods of the year (pooled OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.04?1.30). Conclusion A small but significantly increased odds of post-operative infection may exist for orthopaedic patients who undergo procedures during higher temperature periods. It is hypothesized that this effect is geographically dependent and confounded by meteorological factors, local cultural variables and hospital staffing cycles.

AB  - Delayed healing can result for a number of reasons; however, one important factor in the wound healing process is the role of bacteria. An imbalance in the wound bioburden may lead to infection, and thereby severely delay healing. Thus to ensure healing progresses in a timely manner, it is necessary to maintain a healthy microbial balance and prevent any impending infection. Dermal cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes generate numerous chemokines and growth factors that regulate the immune response and the phases of healing. While topical antiseptics and antimicrobials can kill bacteria and are therefore used to help manage infection in wounds, they may also be cytotoxic to these important cell types. Cytotoxicity is acceptable when overt clinical infection is present, due to a greater need for bacterial balance. However, clinical signs of infection in chronic wounds may not be present, making it difficult to correctly determine diagnosis and appropriate use of these antimicrobial products. In these cases, a product which addresses both the antibacterial action of topical antiseptics/antimicrobials and their impact on key healing factors, (i.e., cytotoxicity to host cells), could help reduce the incidence of wound infection without impacting the rate of healing. In this study we investigated the effect of silver-ORC and an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. The antimicrobial properties of the dressing was also investigated, in in vitro studies using common bacterial wound pathogens. While other silver-releasing dressings address the bioburden of nonhealing wounds, their in vitro cytotoxicity suggests that the rate of healing may not be optimal if the presence of infection is questionable. In contrast this in vitro work suggests the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is not cytotoxic, but is still capable of controlling wound pathogens, suggesting it may be used on a broad spectrum of wounds independent of their bacterial bioburden.
