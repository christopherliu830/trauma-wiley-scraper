AB  - Objectives To explore the occurrence and characterization of carbapenemase-producing pathogens among carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospitalized patients with urinary tract infection in Indonesia. Methods This was a study promoted by the Japanese?Indonesian collaborative research program in the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases. Bacterial pathogens were prospectively isolated from urine specimens of hospitalized urinary tract infection patients at Dr. Soetomo Hospital (Surabaya, Indonesia). All Gram-negative bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporin or carbapenem were included in this study. Carbapenemase genes were investigated for phenotype and genotype. Results In total, 1082 Gram-negative bacilli were isolated, of which 116 strains were resistant to imipenem or meropenem (carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli), and 22 strains were carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli consisted of Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5), Providencia rettgeri (n = 4) and five others. The carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli included NDM-1 (n = 18, 81.8%, in Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.) and IMP-7 (n = 4, 18.2%, all in P. aeruginosa). Among carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, all four P. aeruginosa were sensitive to colistin, and all six Acinetobacter spp. were sensitive to minocycline, colistin and tigecycline. Of those patients harboring carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli, 12 (54.5%) were seriously ill at the time of admission, with longer hospital stays and three deaths (13.6% mortality rate). Conclusions Urinary tract infection-causing carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are widely disseminated in Indonesia. The NDM-1 phenotype seems to be dominant, and it can be treated with colistin and tigecycline in most cases. Most patients harboring carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli are seriously ill, have a bad prognosis, with a longer hospital stay and a significant mortality rate.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis is an infectious disease that affects the tooth-supporting tissues and exhibits a wide range of clinical, microbiological and immunological manifestations. The disease is associated with and is probably caused by a multifaceted dynamic interaction of specific infectious agents, host immune responses, harmful environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility factors. This volume of Periodontology 2000 covers key subdisciplines of periodontology, ranging from etiopathogeny to therapy, with emphasis on diagnosis, classification, epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, immunology, systemic complications, anti-infective therapy, reparative treatment, self-care and affordability issues. Learned and unlearned concepts of periodontitis over the past 50?years have shaped our current understanding of the etiology of the disease and of clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe the bacterial and fungal microbiota of the conjunctiva and factors influencing these microbiota of healthy cats. To evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile and discuss the use of appropriate antimicrobial drugs. Animals studied One hundred and twenty healthy cats Procedures Conjunctival samples with dry or premoistened swabs were obtained from both eyes and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. In vitro bacterial, susceptibility testing was performed. The effects of age, sex, breed, season, living environment, and sample collection technique on the frequency and composition of microbial isolation were evaluated. Results In 49 of 120 cats (40.8%) and 73 of 240 swabs (30.4%), microorganisms were isolated. Of the isolates, 71% (61/86) were Gram-positive bacteria, 26% (22/86) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 3% (3/86) were fungi. Staphylococcus felis (17/86; 19.8%) was the most commonly isolated species. Moraxella osloensis (5/86; 5.8%) was the most frequent Gram-negative species. The season had a statistically significant influence (P = 0.04) on the frequency of isolation. The use of premoistened swabs increased the rate of Gram-positive bacterial detection significantly (P = 0.03). The in vitro susceptibility testing showed high efficacy of chloramphenicol, gentamicin, pradofloxacin, and enrofloxacin. Conclusions The isolated microbiota aligns with previous studies performed in other countries, although the microbiota of cats in the present study showed wider bacterial diversity, and more Gram-negative species were isolated. Swab sampling should be performed with premoistened swabs. The topical antimicrobials gentamicin and chloramphenicol are suitable therapeutics for first-line treatment.

AB  - In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.

AB  - Abstract Bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of pulp and periapical diseases. The primary aim of endodontic treatment is to remove as many bacteria as possible from the root canal system and then to create an environment in which any remaining organisms cannot survive. This can only be achieved through the use of a combination of aseptic treatment techniques, chemomechanical preparation of the root canal, antimicrobial irrigating solutions and intracanal medicaments. The choice of which intracanal medicament to use is dependent on having an accurate diagnosis of the condition being treated, as well as a thorough knowledge of the type of organisms likely to be involved and their mechanisms of growth and survival. Since the disease is likely to have been caused by the presence of bacteria within the root canal, the use of an antimicrobial agent is essential. Many medicaments have been used in an attempt to achieve the above aims but no single preparation has been found to be completely predictable or effective. Commonly used medicaments include calcium hydroxide, antibiotics, non-phenolic biocides, phenolic biocides and iodine compounds. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and further research is required to determine which is best suited for root canal infections.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.
