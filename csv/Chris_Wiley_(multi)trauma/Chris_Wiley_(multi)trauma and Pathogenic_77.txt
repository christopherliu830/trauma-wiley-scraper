AB  - In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.

AB  - Lumbar disc protrusion is common. Its clinical manifestations and treatments are closely related to the pathological changes; however, the pathological classification of lumbar disc protrusion is controversial. This article introduces a new pathological classification comprising four types of lumbar disc protrusion according to intraoperative findings. The damage-herniation type is probably caused by injury and is characterized by soft herniation, the capsule can easily be cut and the broken disc tissue blocks overflow or is easily removed. The broken disc substances should be completely removed; satisfactory results can be achieved by minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. The degeneration-protrusion type is characterized by hard and tough protrusions and the pathological process by degeneration and proliferative reaction. The nerve should be decompressed and relaxed with minimally invasive removal of the posterior wall; the bulged or protruded disc often need not be excised. The posterior vertebral osteochondrosis with disc protrusion type is characterized by deformity of the posterior vertebral body, osteochondral nodules and intervertebral disc protrusion. The herniated and fragmented disc tissue should be removed with partially protruding osteochondral nodules. Intervertebral disc cyst is of uncertain pathogenesis and is characterized by a cyst that communicates with the disc. Resection of the cyst under microscopic or endoscopic control can achieve good results; and whether the affected disc needs to be simultaneously resected is controversial. The new pathological classification proposed here is will aid better understanding of pathological changes and pathogenesis of lumbar disc protrusion and provides a reference for diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Summary: The complement system has once again come into prominence in the therapeutic development arena. The recent approval of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, eculizumab, which is directed against complement component C5 for the disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has provided the initial validation of this system as a therapeutic target. Preclinical studies using animal models and human-derived samples demonstrate that inhibition of complement ameliorates many inflammatory and autoimmune disease manifestations. Major efforts continue to define the most optimal means to block complement activation in a cost-effective manner. Because the system is initiated through three pathways and generates at least six immunoregulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators, there is substantial complexity to this problem. One pathway, designated the alternative pathway, has recently been shown to play a particularly important role in preclinical disease models. Further evidence of the importance of the alternative pathway has been provided by studies of human diseases, where mutations or dysfunctional polymorphisms that promote activation of this pathway are highly associated with the diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, dense deposit disease, and age-related macular degeneration. This article reviews evidence in support of the essential role of the alternative pathway in the generation of tissue injury and the rationale for development of therapies that modulate its activity.
