AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a basis for understanding how and why hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may effectively treat severe autoimmune diseases (ADs) and describes the preclinical studies that have contributed to this understanding. It begins with an overview of how normal antigen-specific immune responses develop, followed by a discussion of why autoimmunity occurs. Thereafter, studies on preclinical models using HCT for the treatment of autoimmune syndromes are presented. The HCT studies are described as they were originally performed using congenic, syngeneic, or pseudoautologous donors with the understanding that all of these graft types serve as models for autologous HCT. ADs arise when immune effector cells cause damage to tissues. The response may be organ specific or systemic, and more than one autoimmune syndrome can exist in an individual. Depletion of host T cells is the most extensively studied mechanism by which allogeneic HCT can alter immune function.

AB  - Abstract The indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated hospital building controls infection rates as well as influences patients? healing processes and overall medical outcomes. This review covers the scientific research that has assessed patients? medical outcomes concerning at least one indoor environmental parameter related to building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as indoor air temperature, relative humidity, and indoor air ventilation parameters. Research related to the naturally ventilated hospital buildings was outside the scope of this review article. After 1998, a total of 899 papers were identified that fit the inclusion criteria of this study. Of these, 176 papers have been included in this review to understand the relationship between the health outcomes of a patient and the indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated hospital building. The purpose of this literature review was to summarize how indoor environmental parameters related to mechanical ventilation systems of a hospital building are impacting patients. This review suggests that there is a need for future interdisciplinary collaborative research to quantify the optimum range for HVAC parameters considering airborne exposures and patients? positive medical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Over the course of 4?weeks, two female aged bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) group-housed females died after the dominant male was removed from the group and the newly dominant male persistently chased, caught and bred all females in the pen. The two aged affected females were observed exhibiting lethargy, dyspnea, with widespread necroulcerative lesions in and around the mouth, muzzle and bridge of their noses. Extensive ulcerative glossitis, necrotic bronchopneumonia with intra-nuclear inclusions and the absence of other evidence is highly suggestive that death was caused by an alphaherpes virus commonly known as herpes B virus. Herpes B virus is a potentially zoonotic disease periodically shed by macaques, which is structurally related to herpes simplex viruses I and II of humans. The emergence of fatal B virus to primates in this pen may have been associated with the combination of age and stress in the affected individuals.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.

AB  - Summary This review focuses on the molecular genetics, biochemistry and evolution of terpenoid synthases relevant to terpenoid defences in conifers. In grand fir (Abies grandis) biosynthesis of terpenoids of the three classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes is inducible t y stem wounding at the level of gene activation and increase of enzyme activity of the respective terpene synthases. The monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases utilize prenyl diphosphates of appropriate size as substrates to generate the large diversity of carbon skeletons characteristic of the terpenoid resin of conifers. A large and diverse gene family of grand fir terpene synthases has been cloned and cDNAs arc actively expressed in Escherichia coli for enzyme characterization. The monophyletic group of grand fir monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases represents both constitutively expressed and inducible genes encoding single product and multiple product enzymes. Several events of gene duplication and functional specialization of new synthases occurred during the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis in grand fir, and gave rise to the enormous diversity and variability of this ancient and successful plant defence against herbivores and pathogens. The review concludes with a perspective of the biotechnological applications of terpenoid synthases for the genetic engineering of agricultural crops and forest trees.
