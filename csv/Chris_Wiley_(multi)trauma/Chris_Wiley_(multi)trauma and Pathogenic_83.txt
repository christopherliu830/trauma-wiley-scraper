AB  - Summary A large number of living things, including algae, lichens and plants, live on the outside of trees. They are classed as epiphytes because they take nothing from the tree and are just using the tree as a handy place on which to grow; as such, they are different from parasites which take things from the tree. Until recently, pest and disease management has played a minor part for professionals involved in urban tree management. Deadwood, whether whole branches or the decaying wood inside living trees, is an important habitat for flora and fauna, with thousands of associated species in all sorts of microhabitats within the deadwood. The natural fracture pruning techniques, leaving something more jagged, create a whole range of microhabitats for deadwood organisms. Coronet cutting has been used to mimic natural branch breakage. This technique is used for cutting back live branches, with the express aim of creating deadwood in the crown.

AB  - Research involving nonhuman primates (NHPs) has played a vital role in many of the medical and scientific advances of the past century. NHPs are used because of their similarity to humans in physiology, neuroanatomy, reproduction, development, cognition, and social complexity?yet it is these very similarities that make the use of NHPs in biomedical research a considered decision. As primate researchers, we feel an obligation and responsibility to present the facts concerning why primates are used in various areas of biomedical research. Recent decisions in the United States, including the phasing out of chimpanzees in research by the National Institutes of Health and the pending closure of the New England Primate Research Center, illustrate to us the critical importance of conveying why continued research with primates is needed. Here, we review key areas in biomedicine where primate models have been, and continue to be, essential for advancing fundamental knowledge in biomedical and biological research. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Objective of review Surgical site infections are a recognised complication of cochlear implant (CI) surgery with significant morbidity. Our aim was to search for the optimum prevention and management strategy to deal with this issue. Type of review Systematic review. Search strategy A systematic literature search was undertaken from the databases of Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE?, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evaluation method All relevant titles, abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed by two authors who resolved any differences by discussion and consultation with senior authors. Results Fourteen articles were included in our review. The overall quality of evidence was low with the vast majority of the studies being retrospective case series and expert opinions. No randomised controlled trials were noted. We found consistent reports that intraoperative prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients undergoing CI and that the vast majority of CI wound infections had grown Staphylococcal spp. or Pseudomonas spp. Conclusion Our review has not identified any reliable or reproducible strategies to prevent and deal with wound infections after CI. We strongly encourage further research within this field and would suggest that a consensus of opinions from a multidisciplinary panel of experts may be a pragmatic way forward as an effective guide.

AB  - In an increasingly interdependent world, we face an array of new global challenges that transcend the traditional definition of national security. One important example is the resurgence of infectious diseases. In the 1960s and 1970s, powerful antibiotic drugs and vaccines appeared to have banished the major plagues from the industrialized world, leading to a mood of complacency and the neglect of programs for disease surveillance and prevention. Over the past few decades, however, infectious diseases have returned with a vengeance. Many factors, or combinations of factors, can contribute to disease emergence. New infectious diseases may emerge from genetic changes in existing organisms; known diseases may spread to new geographic areas and populations; and previously unknown infections may appear in humans due to changing ecological conditions that increase their exposure to insect vectors, animal reservoirs, or environmental sources of novel pathogens. Reemergence may also occur because of the development of anti-microbial resistance in existing infections (e.g., malaria) or breakdowns in public health measures for previously controlled infections due to civil conflict (e.g., cholera, tuberculosis). Not only does the re-emergence of infectious diseases threaten health directly, but devastating epidemics such as AIDS are spawning widespread political instability and civil conflict. This instability, in turn, will contribute to humanitarian emergencies and economic crises.

AB  - At the beginning of the 21st century, the therapeutic management of neurodegenerative disorders remains a major biomedical challenge, particularly given the worldwide ageing of the population over the past 50 years that is expected to continue in the forthcoming years. This review will focus on the promise of cannabinoid-based therapies to address this challenge. This promise is based on the broad neuroprotective profile of cannabinoids, which may cooperate to combat excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, glia-driven inflammation and protein aggregation. Such effects may be produced by the activity of cannabinoids through their canonical targets (e.g. cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoid enzymes) and also via non-canonical elements and activities in distinct cell types critical for cell survival or neuronal replacement (e.g. neurons, glia and neural precursor cells). Ultimately, the therapeutic events driven by endocannabinoid signalling reflect the activity of an endogenous system that regulates the preservation, rescue, repair and replacement of neurons and glia.
