AB  - Mohammadi Z, Dummer PMH. Properties and applications of calcium hydroxide in endodontics and dental traumatology. International Endodontic Journal, 44, 697?730, 2011. Abstract Calcium hydroxide has been included within several materials and antimicrobial formulations that are used in a number of treatment modalities in endodontics. These include, inter-appointment intracanal medicaments, pulp-capping agents and root canal sealers. Calcium hydroxide formulations are also used during treatment of root perforations, root fractures and root resorption and have a role in dental traumatology, for example, following tooth avulsion and luxation injuries. The purpose of this paper is to review the properties and clinical applications of calcium hydroxide in endodontics and dental traumatology including its antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, effect on bacterial biofilms, the synergism between calcium hydroxide and other agents, its effects on the properties of dentine, the diffusion of hydroxyl ions through dentine and its toxicity. Pure calcium hydroxide paste has a high pH (approximately 12.5?12.8) and is classified chemically as a strong base. Its main actions are achieved through the ionic dissociation of Ca2+ and OH? ions and their effect on vital tissues, the induction of hard-tissue deposition and the antibacterial properties. The lethal effects of calcium hydroxide on bacterial cells are probably due to protein denaturation and damage to DNA and cytoplasmic membranes. It has a wide range of antimicrobial activity against common endodontic pathogens but is less effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Calcium hydroxide is also an effective anti-endotoxin agent. However, its effect on microbial biofilms is controversial.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in an immediate loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site and is associated with a poor prognosis. The inhibitory environment that develops in response to the injury is mainly due to local expression of inhibitory factors, scarring and the formation of cystic cavitations, all of which limit the regenerative capacity of endogenous or transplanted cells.Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective.Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.

AB  - Summary Inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. The lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. This is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (HTS) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. HTS diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of DNA samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. Increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. Our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. In the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.

AB  - Summary Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a role in another aspect of central nervous system (CNS) development- the formation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Most individuals become aware of brain-gut communication when disturbed gastrointestinal function is communicated to the brain. Indeed, it is suggested that defects in gut-brain axis communication are an underlying cause of functional bowel disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and, potentially, inflammatory bowel disease. The absence of a microbiota results in an exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress and altered behavior, particularly reduced anxiety-related behavior, in rodents. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of cognitive and emotional behaviors, being a key promoter of neuronal survival and growth as well as differentiation of new neurons and synapses. At the heart of understanding how neural signaling between the gut and brain can modulate mood and behavior lies the concept of interoception.

AB  - Summary General practitioners, geriatricians and diabetologists need to pay particular attention to the feet of older patients to prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable group. Reduced mobility, particularly at the hip, and impaired vision restricts the ability of older patients to inspect their feet and leads to the continued progression of foot lesions. Neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease are also more prevalent in the elderly. The conditions reviewed here are peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, limited joint mobility and foot pressure abnormalities. The classification, properties and management of ulcers, from superficial to gangrene, are described, as is the diabetic Charcot foot. By recognising the known risk factors and taking measures to reduce their effect, the incidence of foot ulceration can be significantly reduced. Systematic and appropriate management of foot ulceration can decrease the incidence of amputations; this is the ultimate goal in the treatment of diabetic foot problems.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.
