AB  - Radiotherapy has been widely used for the clinical management of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, radioresistance remains a serious concern that prevents the efficacy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) radiotherapy. REV7, the structural subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase ?, has multiple functions in bypassing DNA damage and modulating mitotic arrest in human cell lines. However, the expression and molecular function of REV7 in ESCC progression remains unclear. In this study, we first examined the expression of REV7 in clinical ESCC samples, and we found higher expression of REV7 in ESCC tissues compared to matched adjacent or normal tissues. Knockdown of REV7 resulted in decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis in irradiated Eca-109 and TE-1 cells coupled with decreased tumor weight in a xenograft nude mouse model postirradiation. Conversely, overexpression of REV7 resulted in radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, silencing of REV7 induced increased reactive oxygen species levels postirradiation. Proteomic analysis of REV7-interacting proteins revealed that REV7 interacted with peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a well-known antioxidant protein. Existence of REV7-PRDX2 complex and its augmentation postirradiation were further validated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. REV7 knockdown significantly disrupted the presence of nuclear PRDX2 postirradiation, which resulted in oxidative stress. REV7-PRDX2 complex also assembled onto DNA double-strand breaks, whereas REV7 knockdown evidently increased double-strand breaks that were unmerged by PRDX2. Taken together, the present study sheds light on REV7-modulated radiosensitivity through interacting with PRDX2, which provides a novel target for ESCC radiotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - IDEAS (intellectual disabilities evaluation and advice system) provides the opportunity for physicians who are sending samples for the Greenwood Genetic Center (GGC) 92-gene X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) (formerly X-linked mental retardation) panel to have their male patient's clinical features reviewed by an experienced panel of six Clinical Geneticists. They were asked to obtain parental consent, complete a one-page information form, and provide A?P and lateral photographs. The panel members independently reviewed the material and forwarded comments about clinical features, possible diagnoses, and/or further testing for the patient. We present the results of the first 55 patients evaluated. In only a single case did all panelists agree on a non-XLID diagnosis, later proven by genetic testing. The XLID gene panel diagnosed an additional five (9%) cases, but in only two cases did one panelist suggest the correct gene, which was one of four they suggested. This paper examines the possible reasons for the low rate of clinical diagnosis and suggests that, while the data received were often incomplete, the most important reasons for lack of diagnoses were the source of referral and selection of patients for review. We did note that there were a number of instances where we disagreed with the submitted information as to whether the individual was dysmorphic and with the stated presence of certain physical signs, most often downslanted palpebrae and posterior ear angulation. These differences in assessment of clinical signs and the general lack of completeness and detail provided in the standard data sheet, including that regarding the extended family history, lead us to raise concerns regarding the feasibility of establishing high quality central clinical databases designed to aid in the interpretation of exomic/genomic variants. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Contents Pyometra is a common disease in countries where elective spaying is not routinely performed. Hormonal and bacterial factors are fundamental in the pathogenesis of the disease, which manifests itself as a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of the uterus. Surgical ovariohysterectomy is the safest and most effective treatment for pyometra, and it has recently been shown that laparoscopically assisted methods for surgical treatment are feasible to use in selected cases. New protocols for improved medical treatment alternatives have also been tested with promising results. To be able to predict outcome and presence of complications early would be valuable in clinical practice for optimizing therapy and increasing survival. Results of commonly investigated clinical and laboratory investigations have been shown to be useful as predictive markers, with leucopenia being associated with increased risk of peritonitis as well as prolonged post-operative hospitalization after surgical treatment. A cage-side rapid and cost-effective diagnostic test would be highly valuable in clinical practice, and detection of pyometra-specific upregulated genes in the uterus and the corresponding products is a potential start in identifying novel markers suitable for such as test. The focus of the present review is to highlight recent findings on pathogenesis, prediction of outcome, diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, central research questions and suggestions for future investigations about several aspects of canine pyometra will be addressed.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory confirmation, prevention, surveillance, control of an outbreak for various diseases. The diseases include amoebic dysentery, anthrax, bacillus cereus, botulism, brucellosis, campylobacter, chicken pox, chikungunya, chlamydia pneumonia, chlamydia trachomatis, cholera, clostridium perfringens, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, dengue fever, diphtheria, enterovirus infections, Epstein-Barr virus, gram-negative bacteraemia, hantavirus infection, Hepatitis E virus, influenza, listeriosis, lyme disease, malaria, measles, pneumococcal infection, rabies, relapsing fever, rubella, schistosomiasis, tularaemia, typhoid, viral haemorrhagic fevers, and Zika virus infection. Leishmania are flagellate protozoan parasites transmitted by the bite of sand flies. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of disease, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occurs when parasites have migrated to vital organs. Acanthamoebae are free-living trophozoites in moist environments that can cause keratitis. The microorganism can survive in the space between lens and the eye, especially in people using contact lenses.
