AB  - Abstract:? Although less than 1% of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) develop the catastrophic variant, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine today. However, the rarity of this variant makes it extraordinarily difficult to study in any systematic way. In order to put together all the published case reports as well as the new diagnosed cases from all over the world, an international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (?CAPS Registry?) was created in 2000 by the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibodies. Currently, it documents the entire clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data of more than 300 patients whose data have been fully registered. This registry can be freely consulted at the Internet (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) and it is expected that the periodical analysis of these data will allow us to increase our knowledge of this condition.

AB  - Summary The lagomorphs include the hares/rabbits (family Leporidae) and the pikas (Ochotonidae) which occupy numerous habitats throughout North America. This chapter focuses on cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) since they are more widely distributed than jackrabbits/hares and pikas and are more likely to be encountered and brought in for rehabilitation. The 17 species of cottontails are widely distributed throughout the New World. In general, they utilize disturbed, early successional, or shrub-dominated habitats with abundant forage and dense understory cover. Wild rabbits must show behavioral fitness prior to release back into the Wild. In particular, juvenile rabbits should be appropriately wary of predators, be able to recognize and forage effectively for natural food items, and interact normally with conspecifics. The chapter also presents much more information about captive care and medical/surgical concerns in cottontails than for other North American lagomorphs.

AB  - Abstract Among the earliest invariant neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the degeneration of vulnerable hippocampal CA1 and subicular pyramidal neurons. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a secreted protein that functions in signaling growth cone collapse, chemorepulsion and neuronal apoptosis during early development of the central nervous system. In this report we show that accumulation of an internalized form of Sema3A is associated with degeneration of neurons in vulnerable fields of the hippocampus during AD. Accumulation of Sema3A overlaps the appearance of phosphorylated MAP1B and tau in many neurons, suggesting that Sema3A signaling at some level may be coupled to these previously identified cytoskeletal markers of neurodegeneration. Consistent with this, we isolated and partially characterized a multiprotein complex from the hippocampus of patients with AD that contains phosphorylated MAP1B, collapsin-response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), Plexins A1 and A2, and a processed form of Sema3A. A model is presented in which aberrant release of Sema3A from expressing neurons in the subiculum during AD results in the internalization and transport of Sema3A from this field to CA1. Within the context of the myriad of potential insults that contribute to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, the bioactivity of Sema3A may contribute either directly to neurodegeneration by inducing neuronal collapse, or indirectly by abrogating the recovery capabilities of adult neurons faced with these insults.

AB  - Background: In the past few decades, more patients have been treated orthodontically, but no longitudinal study has compared orthodontic bands and brackets microbiologically and clinically. Methods: This longitudinal trial (split-mouth design) included 24 patients. Microbiology (sub- and supragingival), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and gingival crevicular fluid flow (GCF) were assessed at baseline (band placement) and at weeks 18 (bracket bonding) 20, 24, and 36. A statistical comparison was made over time and among the banded, bonded, and control sites. Results: The aerobe/anaerobe ratio of sub- and supragingival colony forming units decreased significantly (relatively more anaerobes) over the study period for the banded and bonded sites (P <0.001). This decrease was accompanied by significant elevations in PD, BOP, and GCF. These changes occurred faster after bonding compared to banding. No significant changes were observed 18 weeks after banding with the exception of increased PD (P <0.001). At week 36, all microbial and clinical variables at the bonded site had changed significantly in the negative direction (P <0.001) compared to week 18. The control sites did not show any significant changes over time, indicating that the effects were localized. Conclusions: The placement of fixed orthodontic appliances had a significant impact on microbial and clinical variables. The changes occurred faster at the bonded sites compared to the banded sites, probably because wire insertion caused difficulties in approximal cleaning. Over the long term, banding did not lead to more adverse microbial and periodontal effects than bonding.
