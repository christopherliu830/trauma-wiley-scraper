AB  - Summary The use of laser therapy for wound healing has been one of the most studied and implemented applications of photobiomodulation. The established mechanisms and physiologic benefits behind laser therapy make it an obvious choice as an adjunct modality to improve the speed and quality of wound repair. Acute and chronic, mild and severe, and clean and contaminated wounds of all species will respond favorably to laser therapy. For the best clinical results, we need to understand and be able to modify available laser parameters to deliver optimal photobiomodulation treatment regimes.

AB  - Abstract Plants have emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional mammalian cell cultures or microbial cell-based systems system for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. Through recombinant DNA technology, plants can be engineered to produce large quantities of pharmaceuticals and industrial proteins of high quality at low costs. The recombinant production, by transgenic plants, of therapeutic proteins normally present in human plasma, such as cytokines, coagulation factors, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulins, represents a response to the ongoing challenges in meeting the demand for therapeutic proteins to treat serious inherited or acquired bleeding and immunological diseases. As the clinical utilization of fractionated plasma molecules is limited by high production costs, using recombinant biopharmaceuticals derived from plants represents a feasible alternative to provide efficient treatment. Plant-derived pharmaceuticals also reduce the potential risks to patients of infection with pathogens or unwanted immune responses due to immunogenic antigens. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in molecular farming of cytokines. We also examine the technological basis, upcoming challenges, and perspectives for the biosynthesis and detection of these molecules in different plant production platforms.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to microbiologically analyze oral mucosal samples collected during 2?years from patients with oral mucosal complaints. Materials and methods:? Mucosal scraping samples were taken from 297 patients and semiquantified by culture for detection of opportunistic microorganisms e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) and yeasts. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed. Results:? Altogether 297 patients were sampled (mean age 56.8?±?20.7). Among the 110 patients with known medical condition, 48 were systemically immunocompromised, 35 had systemic diseases, and 27 had only local oral complaints. Opportunists in moderate growth or more were present commonly in all three groups and most frequent in the immunocompromised patients (66.7%). Candida species were the most frequent opportunist (68.8%), however, their level was low and combinations with bacterial opportunists were common (39.6%). All bacterial opportunists tested were antibiotic multiresistant. Follow-up samples were collected in 23 cases out of which seven showed still presence of opportunists in heavy growth despite repeated treatment with ciprofloxacin. Conclusions:? This study showed a frequent presence of bacterial and fungal opportunists in patients with oral mucosal complaints, which were most common in immunocompromised individuals, however, also frequent in patients with local oral complaints only. Systematic evaluation of different treatment strategies is needed.

AB  - Abstract Ophthalmic population-based studies have been used to establish the frequency of eye disease and the associated environmental and genetic factors that cause vision impairment and blindness. Most of these studies have concentrated on the diseases of ageing: cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Other studies have identified eye diseases in children but few studies of young adult eye disease exist. We conducted a systematic review of the ophthalmic literature to identify potential population-based eye studies and then note the age of participants in the studies. We then summarized the disease specific to young adults to show there is a need for further research to identify eye disease in this important and often-neglected group in the community. Eighty-four large population-based studies have been conducted worldwide: 9 in North America, 2 in South America, 17 in Africa, 35 in Asia, 11 in Australia and the Pacific, 6 in Europe, 4 in the Middle East and 1 that covered 3 continents. No studies specifically examined young adults. Twenty-six per cent of studies included young adults as part of all ages examined but none of these examined a large number of young adults.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from a self-destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (N = 5) and healthy subjects (N = 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, Austria, for the pesticide active substance Aureobasidium pullulans (strains DSM 14940 and DSM 14941) are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of Aureobasidium pullulans as a fungicide and bactericide on pome fruit. The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.
