AB  - Summary Most wild rodents that are brought to veterinary clinics by either the public or a licensed rehabilitator are the common species in the local area. Many rodents live near humans so people often notice them and often want to help them. In many cases, the wild rodent is fine and would not benefit from human intervention. It may require knowledge of the species' natural history and time to assess the situation and advise on next steps. After the initial quarantine period has passed and the rodent appears healthy, some rodent species (e.g., fox squirrels, and eastern gray squirrels) may be placed with others of the same species, age, size, and developmental stage in order to minimize stress and facilitate socialization. The chapter tabulates natural and captive diets for several rodent species. Diseases in wild rodents vary greatly with species and geographic region. Familiarity with local wildlife diseases is important when diagnosing and treating native rodents.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to microbiologically analyze oral mucosal samples collected during 2?years from patients with oral mucosal complaints. Materials and methods:? Mucosal scraping samples were taken from 297 patients and semiquantified by culture for detection of opportunistic microorganisms e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) and yeasts. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed. Results:? Altogether 297 patients were sampled (mean age 56.8?±?20.7). Among the 110 patients with known medical condition, 48 were systemically immunocompromised, 35 had systemic diseases, and 27 had only local oral complaints. Opportunists in moderate growth or more were present commonly in all three groups and most frequent in the immunocompromised patients (66.7%). Candida species were the most frequent opportunist (68.8%), however, their level was low and combinations with bacterial opportunists were common (39.6%). All bacterial opportunists tested were antibiotic multiresistant. Follow-up samples were collected in 23 cases out of which seven showed still presence of opportunists in heavy growth despite repeated treatment with ciprofloxacin. Conclusions:? This study showed a frequent presence of bacterial and fungal opportunists in patients with oral mucosal complaints, which were most common in immunocompromised individuals, however, also frequent in patients with local oral complaints only. Systematic evaluation of different treatment strategies is needed.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in using high-resolution micro-tomography to investigate the morphology of neurovascular networks in the central nervous system, which remain difficult to characterize due to their microscopic size as well as their delicate and complex 3D structure. Synchrotron radiation X-ray imaging, which has emerged as a cutting-edge imaging technology with a high spatial resolution, provides a novel platform for the non-destructive imaging of microvasculature networks at a sub-micrometre scale. When coupled with computed tomography, this technique allows the characterization of the 3D morphology of vasculature. The current review focuses on recent progress in developing synchrotron radiation methodology and its application in probing neurovascular networks, especially the pathological changes associated with vascular abnormalities in various model systems. Furthermore, this tool represents a powerful imaging modality that improves our understanding of the complex biological interactions between vascular function and neuronal activity in both physiological and pathological states.

AB  - Abstract The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, Austria, for the pesticide active substance Aureobasidium pullulans (strains DSM 14940 and DSM 14941) are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of Aureobasidium pullulans as a fungicide and bactericide on pome fruit. The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), manifested by intricate etiology and pathophysiology, demands careful clinical surveillance due to its high mortality and imminent life support measures. NMR based metabolomics provides an approach for ARDS which culminates from a wide spectrum of illness thereby confounding early manifestation and prognosis predictors. 1H NMR with its manifold applications in critical disease settings can unravel the biomarker of ARDS thus holding potent implications by providing surrogate endpoints of clinical utility. NMR metabolomics which is the current apogee platform of omics trilogy is contributing towards the possible panacea of ARDS by subsequent validation of biomarker credential on larger datasets. In the present review, the physiological derangements that jeopardize the whole metabolic functioning in ARDS are exploited and the biomarkers involved in progression are addressed and substantiated. The following sections of the review also outline the clinical spectrum of ARDS from the standpoint of NMR based metabolomics which is an emerging element of systems biology. ARDS is the main premise of intensivists textbook, which has been thoroughly reviewed along with its incidence, progressive stages of severity, new proposed diagnostic definition, and the preventive measures and the current pitfalls of clinical management. The advent of new therapies, the need for biomarkers, the methodology and the contemporary promising approaches needed to improve survival and address heterogeneity have also been evaluated. The review has been stepwise illustrated with potent biometrics employed to selectively pool out differential metabolites as diagnostic markers and outcome predictors. The following sections have been drafted with an objective to better understand ARDS mechanisms with predictive and precise biomarkers detected so far on the basis of underlying physiological parameters having close proximity to diseased phenotype. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in conducting more studies to help resolve the complex heterogeneity of ARDS with biomarkers of clinical utility and relevance.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes parasites of the digestive system, respiratory system, liver, pancreas, circulatory system, nervous system, reproductive/urogenital system, locomotory system, connective tissue, and the integument of dogs and cats. Two species of the genus Mammomonogamus, which is closely related to Syngamus, are parasitic in the nasal cavities of cats. Infections are usually asymptomatic but affected animals may sneeze and have a nasal discharge due to irritation of the nasal mucosa. Adult worms are red in colour, 1-2 cm long and permanently joined in copula. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and the finding of eggs in the faeces or adult worms on postmortem. The presence of eggs in faeces or sputum and a nasal discharge are indicative of infection. On fox-rearing farms, care should be taken to ensure that runs are created in areas where the soil is dry and free-draining.
