AB  - Summary Neutrophils constitute the first line of cellular defense against invading microorganisms and modulate the subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses. In order to execute a rapid and precise response to infections, neutrophils rely on preformed effector molecules stored in a variety of intracellular granules. Neutrophil granules contain microbicidal factors, the membrane-bound components of the respiratory burst oxidase, membrane-bound adhesion molecules, and receptors that facilitate the execution of all neutrophil functions including adhesion, transmigration, phagocytosis, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The rapid mobilization of intracellular organelles is regulated by vesicular trafficking mechanisms controlled by effector molecules that include small GTPases and their interacting proteins. In this review, we focus on recent discoveries of mechanistic processes that are at center stage of the regulation of neutrophil function, highlighting the discrete and selective pathways controlled by trafficking modulators. In particular, we describe novel pathways controlled by the Rab27a effectors JFC1 and Munc13-4 in the regulation of degranulation, reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular trap production, and endolysosomal signaling. Finally, we discuss the importance of understanding these molecular mechanisms in order to design novel approaches to modulate neutrophil-mediated inflammatory processes in a targeted fashion.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), manifested by intricate etiology and pathophysiology, demands careful clinical surveillance due to its high mortality and imminent life support measures. NMR based metabolomics provides an approach for ARDS which culminates from a wide spectrum of illness thereby confounding early manifestation and prognosis predictors. 1H NMR with its manifold applications in critical disease settings can unravel the biomarker of ARDS thus holding potent implications by providing surrogate endpoints of clinical utility. NMR metabolomics which is the current apogee platform of omics trilogy is contributing towards the possible panacea of ARDS by subsequent validation of biomarker credential on larger datasets. In the present review, the physiological derangements that jeopardize the whole metabolic functioning in ARDS are exploited and the biomarkers involved in progression are addressed and substantiated. The following sections of the review also outline the clinical spectrum of ARDS from the standpoint of NMR based metabolomics which is an emerging element of systems biology. ARDS is the main premise of intensivists textbook, which has been thoroughly reviewed along with its incidence, progressive stages of severity, new proposed diagnostic definition, and the preventive measures and the current pitfalls of clinical management. The advent of new therapies, the need for biomarkers, the methodology and the contemporary promising approaches needed to improve survival and address heterogeneity have also been evaluated. The review has been stepwise illustrated with potent biometrics employed to selectively pool out differential metabolites as diagnostic markers and outcome predictors. The following sections have been drafted with an objective to better understand ARDS mechanisms with predictive and precise biomarkers detected so far on the basis of underlying physiological parameters having close proximity to diseased phenotype. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in conducting more studies to help resolve the complex heterogeneity of ARDS with biomarkers of clinical utility and relevance.

AB  - Epidermolysis bullosa presents a wide range of clinical symptoms. In this case, a patient had recessive dys-trophic epidermolysis bullosa that required dental treatment. Standard protocol modifications and medical considerations were required in preparation for general anesthesia. Postop erative follow-up, including monitoring the relationship of the patient's disease state to dental health, is recommended Summary A patient with a debilitating disease, such as epidermolysis bullosa, is a challenge to the dentist wishing to provide optimal and comprehensive dental treatment. While tissue sloughing and bullae formation during treatment cannot be eliminated, the previously outlined protocol can limit the severity of it. Medical assessment of these patients is mandatory to determine their overall health status. If indicated, a combination medical and dental procedure can be performed under general anesthesia, thereby limiting the number of stressful operations a patient may have to undergo. Triannual dental examinations and continual re-evaluation are necessary to promote continued dental health and recognition of early pathosis. Aggressive preventive measures are necessary to ensure the patient's future dental needs are minimal.

AB  - Summary.? Recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) has become the best choice for treating bleeding of haemophilia A patients. A plasma- and albumin-free recombinant FVIII (rAHF-PFM, ADVATE?), as the third generation rFVIII, virtually eliminates the risk of blood-borne disease transmission by excluding all human blood derived additives throughout cell culture, purification and formulation. In this multicentre prospective clinical study we evaluated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ADVATE? in Chinese patients with haemophilia A. Fifty-eight patients enrolled and received ADVATE? treatment. Of the patients enrolled, eight (13.79%) had severe haemophilia, 45 (77.59%) had moderate haemophilia and five (8.62%) had mild haemophilia. Fifty-four patients completed 6?months of observation. A total of 781 bleeds occurred in these 58 subjects, all evaluable per-protocol. A total of 984 infusions were administered with a mean of 17.0?±?11.1 infusions per patient. On average, each patient received a mean of 15030.2?± 7972.7?IU ADVATE? (median 13?625?IU, range 9500?19?750?IU) during 6?months. The majority of bleeding episodes (95.9%) were successfully treated with one or two infusions of ADVATE?. Overall, response to the first ADVATE? treatment was rated as either ?excellent? (82.8%) or ?improved? (17.2%) in all subjects. All patients tolerated ADVATE? infusions well. One patient (1/58, 1.7%) developed an inhibitor of 4?Betheseda units at day 180 visit. The results of this clinical observational study support that ADVATE? is efficacious, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of Chinese patients with haemophilia A.
