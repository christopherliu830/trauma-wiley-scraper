AB  - Acute wounds caused by the severe and extensive infection such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci or MRSA may be life-threatening in immunocompromised hosts such as steroid users or those with venostasis in the lower legs. The principle of the treatment is the removal of the primary pathogens, however, difficulties of the lower leg reconstruction remain due to the tissue loss and the deficiency of the circulation system after extensive soft tissue debridement. For 10 immediately-developing extensive lower extremity cases, artificial skin substitutes composed of dried bilayer membranes of outer silicone membrane and inner porcine-tendon derived collagen layer (Pelnac?, Gunze Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were immediately after extensive and meticulous debridement. While the skin substitute integrated into the wound bed for maximally 3 weeks, total 20 micrograms of the basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)(Trafermin?, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were applied by the 27-Gage syringe daily. The outer membranes were removed and thin partial thickness skin grafting (9?10/1,000 inches) was performed and wound healed uneventfully. The bFGF-treated skin texture was significantly softer compared to control by a durometer (Teclock?, GS-701N, Tokyo, Japan)(p?<?0.01), which was a measuring device elastic hard products such as rubbers and polymers. Reconstruction using the porcine-derived artificial skin substitute in the lower extremities after extensive debridement was safe, easy, and reproducible. The quality of the wounds with bFGF significantly improves the healed skin texture.

AB  - Abstract Tacrolimus is a nonsteroidal alternative to treat noninfectious otitis externa (OE) in people. This 21-day study investigated whether twice daily application (0.2?mL/dose) of sterile olive oil based 0.1% tacrolimus suspension in ears of atopic beagle dogs without OE was associated with adverse local reactions, development of OE, change in otic cytology, vestibular dysfunction, or hearing loss detected by brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). The study was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Twenty-two dogs matched for age and sex were randomized to tacrolimus or vehicle control treatment groups. Two investigators independently evaluated dogs for signs of adverse effects including OE the first 4?days of treatment, then every 3?days. A logistic regression model was fit for each investigator?s clinical scores (SAS, 9.2, 2008). Time (P?=?0.0032) and group (P?=?0.0167) were always significant for OE. Inter-observer reliability of clinical scores was strong, measured using Kappa coefficients and proportion of agreement. All nine exclusions (7/10 control- and 2/12 tacrolimus-treated dogs) were excluded for yeast OE. Inter-observer agreement to exclude was 100%. All dogs not excluded had normal BAER assessments before treatment, weekly during treatment, and after 21?days of treatment. None showed vestibular abnormalities at these times. Tacrolimus blood concentrations (Abbott IMx Tacrolimus II) were below detection limits (3?ng/mL) at baseline and after 21?days of treatment. Results suggest otic application of olive oil based tacrolimus suspension to canine ears with intact tympanic membranes is unlikely to result in hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction but yeast OE is a possible risk.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.

AB  - Summary Reactions involving free radicals are an inherent feature of plant senescence and appear to contribute to a process of oxidative deterioration that leads ultimately to cell death. Radical species derived from molecular oxygen are the primary mediators of this oxidative damage, but non-radical excited states of oxygen, specifically singlet oxygen, may also be involved. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation of lipids in senescing membranes and the ensuing release of free fatty acids initiate oxidative deterioration by providing substrate for lipoxygenase. In some tissues, lipoxygenase activity increases with advancing senescence in a pattern that is consistent with its putative role in promoting oxidative damage. However, there are important exceptions to this which may be explained by the fact that the timing and extent of peroxidative reactions initiated by lipoxygenase are likely to be determined more by the availability of substrate for the enzyme than by changes in its activity. There are both membranous and cytosolic forms of lipoxygenase in senescing tissues, and peroxidation of membrane lipids appears to be initiated by the membranous enzyme once the appropriate fatty acid substrates, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, become available. Since lipid peroxidation is known to form alkoxy and peroxy radicals as well as singlet oxygen, these reactions in membrane bilayers are probably a major source of activated oxygen species in senescing tissues. Further-more, there are indications that activated oxygen from the lipoxygenase reaction can become substrate for the cytosolic form of the enzyme which, in turn, may raise the titre of activated oxygen during senescence. Additional possible sources of increased free radical production in senescing tissues include peroxidase, which shows greatly increased activity with advancing age, leakage of electrons from electron transport systems to oxygen, in particular from the photosynthetic electron transport system, and decompartmentalization of iron, which would facilitate formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from the less reactive superoxide anion. A variety of macromolecules can be damaged by activated oxygen. Unsaturated fatty acids are especially prone to attack, and this implies that membranes are primary targets of free radical damage. The manifestations of this damage in senescing tissues range from altered membrane fluidity and phase properties to leakiness that can be attributed to a destabilized and highly perturbed membrane bilayer. There is also a progressive breakdown of cellular protein with advancing senescence. Free radicals can inactivate proteins by reacting with specific amino acid residues, and a number of in zitro studies have indicated that such alteration renders the proteins more prone to hydrolysis by proteases. Thus, although there is no direct evidence linking enhanced proteolysis during senescence to free radical damage, there is reason to believe that this may be a contributing factor. Wounding of certain plant tissues also initiates a series of reactions that revolve around the breakdown of membrane lipids and their peroxidation. Indeed, as in the case of senescence, membrane deterioration follokving wounding appears to be facilitated by a self-perpetuating wave of free radical production emanating from peroxidation within the lipid bilayer. There is also recent evidence for activation of an O2? -producing NADPH oxidase in plant tissues following fungal infection that may be analogous to the well-characterized O2?-generating NADPH oxidase associated with the plasma membrane of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This raises the interesting possibility that plants and animals share a common defence response to invading organisms.

AB  - Background and purpose The influence of the immune system on seizures and epileptogenesis has been increasingly considered, in particular the role of autoantibodies. In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of intrathecal antibody synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment of patients with epilepsy. Methods In a retrospective cohort study trial in a university hospital neurology department, 164 well-characterized patients with different etiologies of seizures and epilepsies, and 77 control patients were included. Results CSF-specific immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and IgA) synthesis was significantly (P?<?0.0001) more frequent in patients with epilepsy (34.1%) compared with age- and sex-matched controls (2.6%). The highest incidence of intrathecal Ig synthesis was detected in patients with encephalitis-related acute symptomatic seizures (86.7%), but also in patients with focal epilepsy so far classified cryptogenic (45.2%). Antibody synthesis was not related to the number of CSF white blood cells. Conclusions Humoral immune activation in the CSF compartment was detected in one-third of patients with epilepsy, besides acute symptomatic seizures particularly frequent in cryptogenic epilepsy ? an etiology so far defined as not having a detectable cause. Systematic prospective clinical and experimental trials are required to identify antigenic targets and select appropriate patients for which immunotherapy might offer new causal therapeutic options.
