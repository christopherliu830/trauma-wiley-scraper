AB  - Abstract Background:? Surviving multi-trauma is strongly associated with emergent resuscitation and treatment in modern medical facilities. Multi-trauma survival before the advent of modern medicine is likely to have been extremely uncommon, particularly in primitive societies. The aim of this study was to investigate the case of an ancient Australian Aboriginal who appeared to have survived multi-trauma. Methods:? We investigated the skeletal remains of an adult Australian Aboriginal with healed fractures of the right femur and humerus. The time of death was assessed by carbon dating. The sex and approximate age of the subject were assessed from the skeleton's morphometry. The fractured bones were assessed by visual inspection, plain radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Results:? The remains were of a male aged approximately 50 years at the time of his death, approximately 1000 years ago, preceding European settlement. Analysis of the malunions indicated that all fractures occurred in one traumatic event, normally a life-threatening injury combination, and that the subject survived for years after this incident, despite no or failed active treatment of his fractures. Conclusions:? The survival of a man living in a primitive society after multi-trauma reflects an impressive depth of nursing and social support in a community of hunter gatherers.

AB  - Rather than assuming that psychological terms mirror natural categories in the world and that the task of the helping professions is to find ways to discover, diagnose and treat these categories, our goal is to inquire about the status of the categories as an aid to then focusing on therapeutic responses. To that end, we unsettle trauma by exploring its social ontology as a disorder as well as its grammar. Feminist and cultural critiques of PTSD illustrate the limitations of the dominant discourse of trauma, moving trauma from individual pathology to social pathology. We offer two illustrations from the family therapy literature that draw upon polyphony, inner dialogues and the creation of new narratives to expand beyond the pathologising potentials of the discourse of trauma. Practitioner points Understanding the concept of trauma as a socially embedded construction is a necessary first step towards recognising its different applications in therapeutic work The dialogic/constructionist stance taken here assumes that meaning and understanding are shaped by discourse and interaction The taken-for-granted meanings associated with trauma need to be questioned Practitioners may then assess when the use of a PTSD diagnosis might import individualising and objectifying assumptions that undermine the goals of systemic family therapy

Physical examination findings included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hind limb paresis in a laterally recumbent patient. Radiographs, laboratory evaluation, and abdominocentesis revealed the presence of hemoperitoneum, blunt hepatic trauma, pneumothorax, and a small abdominal hernia. The ferret was treated with resuscitative fluids, thoracocentesis, abdominal counterpressure, and blood transfusion. This is the first case report of multi-systemic trauma in a ferret. The ferret made a complete recovery and was discharged to the referring veterinarian three days after presentation. (Vet. Emerg. Crit. Care, 10:13?18, 2000)

AB  - Summary Clinicians know from experience that adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) are at risk for sub-optimal parental attachments and maltreatment from within and outside of the family. Until now, thinking about attachment in this population has been broad brush and has lacked a coherent conceptual framework to understand the role attachment plays in clinical problems. This has been largely due to a lack of reliable and valid attachment assessments for this population. This chapter addresses these issues using the first direct developmental adult attachment assessment that has demonstrated face and conceptual validity for this population: the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System. The chapter outlines some basic tenets of attachment theory as it pertains to trauma, including how trauma is related to mourning. It provides two case examples that exemplify the most common form of pathological mourning in the sample: unresolved chronic mourning.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To evaluate clinical presentation of pathologic fractures associated with suspected or confirmed osteosarcoma in dogs and to assess treatment and survival times. Study design: Case series. Animals: Dogs (n=25) appendicular pathologic fracture. Methods: Medical records (January 1997?May 2008) of dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a suspected or confirmed osteosarcoma were reviewed. Dogs were included if they had radiographic evidence of a pathologic fracture and a presumptive or definitive diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Radiographic details, histopathology, and/or cytology findings were recorded. Overall median survival time (MST) and MST of treated dogs were calculated. Age, sex, breed, and other concurrent treatment were evaluated. Results: Rottweilers, Irish Wolfhounds, and Greyhounds were the most common breeds represented. Most dogs had minor trauma and 60% had lameness preceding the fracture. Most commonly, fractures were nondisplaced with minimal comminution. None of the dogs had radiographic evidence of pulmonary metastases at admission. Immediate (13 dogs; 52%) and delayed (4; 16%) euthanasia were performed. One dog was not treated and died 90 days after diagnosis. Three dogs (12%) were treated by amputation alone, 1 (4%) with amputation and chemotherapy, and 3 (12%) with internal fixation using an interlocking nail. Overall MST was 1 day (range, 0?623 days) and MST of treated dogs was 406.5 days. Histologic confirmation of osteosarcoma was available in all treated dogs and 6 euthanatized dogs. Conclusions: Treatment of pathologic fracture associated with presumptive osteosarcoma should be considered as an option to amputation or euthanasia if owners desire other options.

AB  - Abstract:? In the discrimination of falls versus blows, the hat brim line (HBL) rule is mentioned in several textbooks as the most useful single criterion. Recent studies, however, have found that the HBL rule is only moderately valid and that its use on its own is not recommended. The purpose of this 6-year retrospective study was to find additional individually useful criteria in the distinction of falls from blows. Overall, the following criteria were found to point toward blows: more than three lacerations, laceration length of 7?cm or more, comminuted or depressed calvarial fractures, lacerations or fractures located above the HBL, left-side lateralization of lacerations or fractures, more than four facial contusions or lacerations, presence of ear lacerations, presence of facial fractures, and presence of postcranial osseous and/or visceral trauma. Based on the most discriminating criteria, a decision tree was constructed to be potentially applicable to future cases.

AB  - ABSTRACT A cat was presented in coma following severe trauma. The cat was alert and walking within 24 hours, after treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and mannitol. However, he subsequently began to show evidence of severe abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy revealed traumatic avulsion of the left limb of the pancreas. A sub-total pancreatectomy was performed and the cat recovered well. Two weeks post-operatively, the cat was re-presented with ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and upper motor neuron weakness in all four limbs. Radiographs revealed a fracture/luxation of C1?C2 which could not be adequately stabilized solely via a dorsal approach. A combined ventral and dorsal approach produced stabilization of the cervical spine which was clinically successful. Two months post-operatively there was stability but malalignment of C1?C2, and the cat appeared normal.

AB  - ABSTRACT Consensus has not been reached regarding the ability of pathologic fracture to predict local recurrence and survival in osteosarcoma. We aim to review the available evidence to examine the association between pathologic fracture and osteosarcoma prognosis. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies published until March 2014 was performed using PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science. The studies investigating pathologic fracture of osteosarcoma patients were systematically analyzed. The overall relative risk (RR) was estimated using a fixed-effect model or random-effect model according to heterogeneity between the trials. We included nine cohort studies involving 2,187 patients (311 with pathologic fracture and 1,876 without fracture) for the analysis of survival rate and local recurrence. Studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle?Ottawa Assessment Scale. In the fixed-effects model, the meta-analysis showed that pathologic fracture in osteosarcoma patients predicted poor 3-year overall survival (OS) (RR?=?1.86, 95% CI: 1.37?2.53, p?<?0.001) and 5-year OS (RR?=?1.34, 95% CI: 1.06?1.70, p?=?0.016). Similarly, pathologic fracture was significantly correlated with worse 3-year event free survival (EFS) (RR?=?1.52, 95% CI: 1.21?1.92, p?<?0.001) and 5-year EFS (RR?=?1.24, 95% CI: 1.03?1.49, p?=?0.021), whereas no significant association was noted with local recurrence (RR?=?1.30, 95% CI: 0.84?2.02, p?=?0.233). The meta-analysis confirmed that pathologic fracture in osteosarcoma was a prognostic marker for both OS and EFS but not for local recurrence. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Abstract Objective The trauma team process was recently implemented at the Colonial War Memorial (CWM) Hospital, Suva. This study audits the trauma call procedure at the hospital over a period of 12?months. Method Retrospective descriptive study of trauma calls from August 2015 to July 2016 at CWM Hospital. Data relating to patient demographics, time of presentation, time to team assembly and time to computed tomography (CT) scan were extracted from the ED trauma call database. Disposition from the ED and status at hospital discharge was extracted from the hospital patient information system. Results There were 38 trauma calls for 46 patients. Seventy-two per cent were male. Eighty-two per cent occurred when the CT radiographer was off site (16.00?08.00 h), including 47% that occurred between midnight and 08.00 h. Fifty-two per cent of patients were intubated, 43% went to ICU, 26% went directly to the operating theatre, and 37% died. Benchmarks for time to trauma team assembly and time to CT scan were met in 50% of cases. Conclusion This was a severely injured cohort of patients with a high mortality rate. The rate of missed calls was not assessed in this study. Time to CT scan could be improved with an onsite radiographer. Time to team assembly could be improved with trauma team training and early notification from pre-hospital providers. There is a need to continue to monitor and refine the trauma call process and to extend data capture to measure injury severity and outcomes.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Victoria's new trauma care system has been followed by reductions in preventable and potentially preventable deaths and in deficiencies contributing to death. This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - Abstract Twenty patients with osteosarcoma and pathologic fractures were treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum-II (CDP), Adriamycin (ADR) (doxorubicin) and high-dose methotrexate with citrovorum factor ?rescue? (MTX-CF). Before the introduction of the regimen, the primary tumor in two patients was treated by immediate amputation and in 13 with preoperative intraarterial CDP. Among these 13 patients, responses (healing) were observed in 11 (one required the addition of radiation therapy). In three patients, the responses were so dramatic that, at their request, surgery was deferred and treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was instituted. Based on this experience, treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was also administered to an additional five patients who were admitted without pathologic fractures. In the course of such treatment, pathologic fractures also developed; notwithstanding, chemotherapy was maintained and healing also occurred. One of the 20 patients had pulmonary metastases at diagnosis; these were resected after treatment and pathologic examination revealed no evidence of viable tumor. The remaining 19 patients were free of pulmonary metastases but these later developed in seven patients. These data were compared to a historical control series in which 16 of 21 patients with pathologic fractures developed pulmonary metastases. Three of the chemotherapy treated patients died of nonosteosarcoma related causes (leukemia, generalized varicella, and a metabolic complication). Overall, survival was improved in the chemotherapy treated patients as compared to the historical control series: 10 of 20 versus 6 of 21, respectively. Pathologic fractures in osteosarcoma may heal under treatment with chemotherapy, which also has a favorable impact on the eradication of pulmonary metastases and survival. Cancer 59:701-709, 1987.

Care across the continuum is provided by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals who are able to convey benefits such as continuity of care and formulate a comprehensive, holistic view of the patient's needs. In addition the multi-disciplinary team ensures the availability of a range of skills, support and education for the patient, patient's family/carer.

AB  - Summary Objective In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), pathologic high frequency oscillations (pHFOs, 200?600 Hz) are present in the hippocampus, especially the dentate gyrus (DG). The pHFOs emerge during a latent period prior to the onset of spontaneous generalized seizures. We used a unilateral suprahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) mouse model of TLE to characterize the properties of hippocampal pHFOs during epileptogenesis. Methods In awake head-fixed mice, 4?14 days after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE), we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) with 64-channel silicon probes spanning from CA1 alveus to the DG hilus, or with glass pipettes in the DC mode in the CA1 str radiatum. Results The pHFOs, are observed simultaneously in the CA1 and the DG, or in the DG alone, as early as 4 days post-SE. The pHFOs ride on top of DC deflections, occur during motionless periods, persist through the onset of TLE, and are generated in bursts. Burst parameters remain remarkably constant during epileptogenesis, with a random number of pHFOs generated per burst. In contrast, pHFO duration and spectral dynamics evolve from short events at 4 days post-SE to prolonged discharges with complex spectral characteristics by 14 days post-SE. Simultaneous dural EEG recordings were exceedingly unreliable for detecting hippocampal pHFOs; therefore, such recordings may deceptively indicate a ?silent? period even when massive hippocampal activity is present. Significance Our results demonstrate that hippocampal pHFOs exhibit a dynamic evolution during the epileptogenic period following SE, consistent with their role in transitioning to the chronic stage of TLE.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined how diverse and cumulated traumatic experiences predicted maternal prenatal mental health and infant stress regulation in war conditions and whether maternal mental health mediated the association between trauma and infant stress regulation. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers? CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers? higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.

AB  - Summary Most trauma and orthopaedic patients will require some form of rehabilitation and therefore the nurse needs to optimise their role and contribution to the rehabilitation process. This chapter provides an evidence-based discussion of the rehabilitation of the orthopaedic and trauma patient and the specific role of the nurse. This includes a critical application of research to approaches to rehabilitation, where robust evidence exists. The benefits of transdisciplinary team working are explored where nurses and therapists share and expand their collective repertoire of skills and underpinning knowledge.
