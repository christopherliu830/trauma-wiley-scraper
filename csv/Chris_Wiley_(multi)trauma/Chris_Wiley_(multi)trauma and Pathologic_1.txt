AB  - This study was performed primarily to clarify whether pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection is possible using postmortem imaging (PMI), and whether this is worthwhile. A total of 33 cadavers that underwent systematic anatomical dissection at our medical school also underwent PMI. Fixative solution was injected into the corpus 3?4 days after death. PMI was then performed using an 8-slice multi-detector CT scanner 3 months before dissection. Before dissection, a conference was held to discuss the findings of the PMI. First, two radiologists read the postmortem images without any medical information and deduced the immediate cause of death. Then, the anatomy instructor revealed the medical information available. Based on this information, the radiologist, anatomy instructor, and pathologists suggested candidate sampling sites for pathological examination. On the last day of the dissection period, the pathologists resected the sample tissues and processed them for pathological examination. In 12 of 33 cases, the presumed causes of death could be determined based on PMI alone, and revision of the cause of death described in the death certificate was considered in five (15.2%) cases, based on PMI and pathological analysis. This article presents a novel method of pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection using PMI without disturbing the anatomy education of medical students.

AB  - Objective. To reevaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography for detecting and classifying solid-organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma by comparing ultrasonography with computed tomography (CT) and laparotomy. Methods. Six hundred four patients with blunt abdominal trauma were examined by both B-mode ultrasonography and CT for a study period of 14 years. The ultrasonographic examiners were divided into 2 groups depending on their experience with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic results were then compared with CT and surgical findings. This was a retrospective study. Results. In 198 patients, solid-organ injuries were identified on CT, laparotomy, or both. Sensitivity values in group A (experts) were 87.5% for hepatic injuries, 85.4% for splenic injuries, 77.6% for renal injuries, and 44.4% for pancreatic injuries. Sensitivity values in group B were 46.2% for hepatic injuries, 50.0% for splenic injuries, and 44.1% for renal injuries. The detection rates in group A were 80% to 100% for different types of hepatic injuries except superficial injuries (20%) and 70% to 100% for different types of splenic injuries. The detection rates for renal parenchymal and pancreatic duct injuries were 53.3% and 80%, respectively. The detection rates for injuries requiring intervention were 86.1% in group A and 66.7% in group B. Conclusions. The sensitivity of ultrasonography with the use of CT and surgical findings as reference standards decreased compared with our prior study. However, ultrasonography was found to enable experienced examiners to detect and classify parenchymal injuries efficiently, despite disadvantages in detecting superficial and vascular injuries. Ultrasonography should be used to explore not only free fluid but also solid-organ injuries.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Abstract Medical imaging and emergency departments work collaboratively to interpret trauma radiographs. In addition to accurate radiographic interpretation, clear communication is crucial to ensure appropriate and timely management of musculoskeletal injuries. This two-step ?how to guide? provides the reviewer with a recipe for effectively evaluating trauma radiographs for traumatic pathology and succinctly documenting the findings. Step 1 is a systematic search of the radiograph: soft tissues, bones, alignment of joints and satisfaction of search (SBASS). Utilising SBASS increases reviewer confidence in identifying traumatic pathology of the appendicular and axial skeleton. Step 2 is a streamlined communication model for the documentation of pathological findings. The WWW acronym (What is it? Where is it? What is it doing?) can be adapted to describe simple or complex traumatic pathology.

AB  - International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry 2010; 20: 102?111 Purpose.? The purpose was to describe pathologic paediatric conditions associated with airway compromise adversely affecting dental treatment with sedation and general anaesthesia. Methods.? A review of available literature was completed, identifying pathologic paediatric conditions predisposing to airway compromise. Results.? Airway-related deaths are uncommon, but respiratory complication represents the greatest cause of morbidity and mortality during the administration of general anaesthesia. Differences in anatomy and physiology of the paediatric and adult airway contribute to the child?s predisposition to rapid development of airway compromise and respiratory failure; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, cervical spine injury, morbid obesity, and prematurity represent only a few conditions contributing to potential airway compromise of which the paediatric clinician needs to be aware. In all cases, thorough physical examination prior to treatment is mandated to affect a positive treatment outcome. Conclusions.? Successful management of children and adolescents with a compromised airway begins with identification of the problem through a detailed medical history and physical examination. Due to the likely fragile nature of many of these patients, and possibility of concomitant medical conditions affecting airway management, dental treatment needs necessitating pharmacological management are best treated in a controlled setting such as the operating room, where a patent airway can be maintained.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1 mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Summary For well over a 100 years, a diagnostic stew of trauma-related 'diseases' and syndromes has been simmering. This chapter explores the changing meanings of this diagnosis from both historical and theoretical perspectives. Before the advent of the borderline category, the primary division in psychopathology was between neurosis and psychosis. Kernberg (1984) viewed splitting as a 'primitive form' of dissociation. But he used the term to describe dichotomous and alternating aggressive and libidinal ego-states. Trauma disrupts a person's sense of continuity, not only by breaking apart the prior organization of experience but also by impeding the linking of states of mind in the course of development. Ryle (1997) argues that splitting in borderline personality (BPD) is the manifestation of internalized reciprocal role relationships, such as victim/bully, needy child/nurturing caregiver. The splitting in BPD can almost reach the level of delusions.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of patients with unexpected N2 non-small cell lung cancer and their early and late outcomes in the VATS lobectomy group versus the open thoracotomy lobectomy group. Results The overall survival time for all 358 patients was 33.26 ± 0.90 months. The overall survival time for 117 cases in the VATS lobectomy group was 36.02 ± 1.44 months. The overall survival time for 241 cases in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group was 31.92 ± 1.14 months. The survival rates for patients in the VATS lobectomy group were 92.31%, 36.75%, 5.13% at one, three, and five years, respectively. The survival rates for patients in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group were 92.12%, 21.58%, 2.49% at one, three, and five years, respectively. A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding this factor (, P = 0.049). Conclusions VATS lobectomy is feasible and safe to perform on patients with minimal N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Even if lymph node metastasis is unexpectedly detected during surgery, with rigorous preoperative evaluation and systematic lymph node dissection, there is no need to convert to open thoracotomy lobectomy.

AB  - Abstract The current project is a study of craniofacial trauma in a large sample (n?=?896) of Prehispanic Canary Islanders (PCIs). The possible causes and social implications of the trauma found are considered, with reference to archaeological and historical data. Variables include the island, period and ecology, the sex and age of the individuals, the distribution of lesions across the skull (by side and by individual bone) and ante-mortem tooth loss. The results show a fairly high trauma rate (16%), a low prevalence of peri-mortem trauma (3.8% of all lesions), higher prevalence of trauma in males than in females (25% vs. 13% of all individuals), more cranial than facial lesions (8.9% vs. 3.5% of all elements) and more lesions on the left side of the skull (6.7% vs. 4.5% of all elements) which suggests that the lesions were sustained through intentional rather than accidental agency. There was no correspondence between trauma prevalence and ecology. The archaeological and historical data support the assertion that the lesions may be the result of skirmishing between groups, using weapons such as slingshots, stones and staves. The presence of edged-weapon lesions on some individuals suggests that these may have been the victims of contact-period European groups. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract:? Suicide is a deliberate act of ending one?s life. Suicide by use of any explosive device, when not involved in a terrorist act, is quite rare in occurrence when compared with other methods routinely utilized. In this paper, we present to the medicolegal community a case of an adult male who committed suicide with blasting caps and the subsequent extensive damage to the cranial hard tissue. Although the cause and manner of death were relatively straightforward, consultation with forensic anthropologists was requested for an anthropological trauma assessment of the highly fragmented skull. After the skull was cleaned and reconstructed, the analysis revealed similarities between blasting cap trauma to the head and high velocity gunshot trauma to the head. Therefore, in a case where some evidence may have been removed or destroyed, forensic analysis involving trauma of this magnitude could result in a misinterpretation of the true mechanism responsible for the osseous damage. In this case, cooperation among the law enforcement agency, coroner?s investigators, the forensic pathologist, and forensic anthropologists provided a comprehensive death case analysis.

AB  - Abstract Tidal energy converters (turbines) are being developed in many countries as part of attempts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon fuels. However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose?response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2?6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.

The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and psychological characteristics of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients with trauma history. Materials and methods:? The clinical and psychological characteristics of 34 TMD patients with trauma history were compared with those of 340 TMD patients without trauma history. Craniomandibular index (CMI) was used for clinical characteristics of TMD patients. Symptom severity index (SSI) was used to assess the multiple dimensions of pain. Symptom checklist-90-revision (SCL-90-R) was used for psychological evaluation. Results:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed significantly higher CMI and palpation index. TMD patients with trauma history also exhibited higher values in duration, sensory intensity, affective intensity, tolerability, scope of symptom, and total SSI score. In addition, these patients showed significantly higher values in symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Among the symptom dimensions of SCL-90-R, somatization showed the most significant correlations with CMI and SSI. Conclusions:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed more severe subjective, objective, and psychological dysfunction than those without trauma history. Pain of myogenous origin, history of physical trauma, and psychosocial dysfunction were all closely related.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma is the most common cause of death and significant morbidity in childhood; abusive head trauma (AHT) is a prominent cause of significant morbidity and mortality in children younger than 2 years old. Correctly diagnosing AHT is challenging both clinically and radiologically. The primary diagnostic challenges are that the abused children are usually too young to provide an adequate history, perpetrators are unlikely to provide truthful account of trauma, and clinicians may be biased in their assessment of potentially abused children. The main radiological challenge is that there is no single imaging finding that is independently specific for or diagnostic of AHT. The radiological evaluation should be based on the multiplicity and severity of findings and an inconsistency with the provided mechanism of trauma. While the most common neuroimaging finding in AHT is subdural hemorrhage, other less well-known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as the ?lollipop sign? or ?tadpole sign,? parenchymal or cortical lacerations, subpial hemorrhage, cranio-cervical junction injuries including retroclival hematomas, as well as diffuse hypoxic brain injury have been identified and described in the recent literature. While AHT is ultimately a clinical diagnosis combining history, exam, and neuroimaging, familiarity with the typical as well as the less-well known MRI findings will improve recognition of AHT by radiologists.
