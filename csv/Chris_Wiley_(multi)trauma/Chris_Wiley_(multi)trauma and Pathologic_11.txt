AB  - Abstract Mind how you go: The current strategies for the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease are very diverse. Particular attention is given to the search for inhibitors (see picture for two examples) of the proteolytic enzyme ?- and ?-secretase, which inhibits the cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins into amyloid?? peptides, from which the disease-defining deposits of plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients originates. Research on senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease covers an extremely broad range of scientific activities. At the recent international meeting of the Alzheimer's Association (ICAD 2008, Chicago) more than 2200 individual scientific contributions were presented. The aim of this Review is to give an overview of the field and to outline its main areas, starting from behavioral abnormalities and visible pathological findings and then focusing on the molecular details of the pathology. The ?amyloid hypothesis? of Alzheimer's disease is given particular attention, since the majority of the ongoing therapeutic approaches are based on its theoretical framework.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

AB  - Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers, EV have beneficial effects, as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium (EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells (EV release).

AB  - Abstract Neuroimaging in pathological gambling (PG) allows studying brain structure independent of pharmacological/neurotoxic effects occurring in substance addiction. Because of high comorbidity of PG with substance use disorder (SUD), first results on structural deficits in PG are controversial. The current investigation is the first to examine gray matter (GM) volume alterations in PG controlling for the impact of SUD by comparing non-comorbid (PGPURE) and two comorbid (PGALCOHOL and PGPOLY) groups. Two hundred and five individuals were included in the analysis: 107 patients diagnosed with PG and 98 healthy controls (HCs). We employed voxel-based morphometry to look for GM volume differences between the groups controlling for age, smoking and depression. GM decreases in the superior medial and orbital frontal cortex occur independently of substance use in PGPURE compared with HCs. The frontal pattern of GM decrease was comparable with PGALCOHOL group where additionally GM volume was decreased in the anterior cingulate but increased in the amygdala. Moreover, regions in PGALCOHOL + POLY with reduced GM volume were the medial frontal, anterior cingulate and occipital lobe regions. PGALCOHOL + POLY not only exhibited structural deficits in comparison with HCs but also relative to PGPURE in the precuneus and post-central gyrus. We demonstrated specific frontal cortex GM deficits in PG without SUD comorbidities. Whereas some target regions reported in earlier studies might result from comorbid substance abuse, there seems to be a core set of frontal alterations associated with addicted gambling behaviour independent of toxic substance effects.

AB  - Abstract Alterations in cerebrovascular function are evident acutely in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although less is known about their chronic effects. Adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe TBI have been reported to demonstrate diffuse activation throughout the brain during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Because fMRI is a measure related to blood flow, it is possible that any deficits in blood flow may alter activation. An arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequence was performed on seven adolescents with chronic moderate to severe TBI and seven typically developing (TD) adolescents during the same session in which they had performed a social cognition task during fMRI. In the TD group, prefrontal CBF was positively related to prefrontal activation and negatively related to non-prefrontal, posterior, brain activation. This relationship was not seen in the TBI group, who demonstrated a greater positive relationship between prefrontal CBF and non-prefrontal activation than the TD group. An analysis of CBF data independent of fMRI showed reduced CBF in the right non-prefrontal region (p < .055) in the TBI group. To understand any role reduced CBF may play in diffuse extra-activation, we then related the right non-prefrontal CBF to activation. CBF in the right non-prefrontal region in the TD group was positively associated with prefrontal activation, suggesting an interactive role of non-prefrontal and prefrontal blood flow throughout the right hemisphere in healthy brains. However, the TBI group demonstrated a positive association with activation constrained to the right non-prefrontal region. These data suggest a relationship between impaired non-prefrontal CBF and the presence of non-prefrontal extra-activation, where the region with more limited blood flow is associated with activation limited to that region. In a secondary analysis, pathology associated with hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging over the whole brain was related to whole brain activation, revealing a negative relationship between lesion volume and frontal activation, and a positive relationship between lesion volume and posterior activation. These preliminary data, albeit collected with small sample sizes, suggest that reduced non-prefrontal CBF, and possibly pathological tissue associated with T2-hyperintensities, may provide contributions to the diffuse, primarily posterior extra-activation observed in adolescents following moderate to severe TBI.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius has been the predominant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolated from canine skin and mucosae and the most commonly reported staphylococcal pathogen in small animal practice for the last 35 years. Although microbiological tests have historically indicated variability in biochemical characteristics amongst S. intermedius isolates from animals, an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy for clinical purposes was readily achievable with routine phenotypic testing. However, three recent developments have changed our understanding of the term ?S. intermedius? and have challenged veterinary bacteriologists to ensure correct species identification of pathogenic staphylococci from small animals. First, the increasing recognition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in small animal practice and its human health implications demand accurate species identification. Secondly, the application of molecular techniques to analysis of staphylococcal isolates has led to a revised taxonomy and canine isolates of S. intermedius being re-named S. pseudintermedius. Thirdly, the recent, rapid emergence of meticillin- and multi-drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a major therapeutic challenge in veterinary practice worldwide, including the UK. This article discusses the background of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Staphylococcus and reviews the key features of MRSP and its implications for day-to-day laboratory diagnosis and small animal practice.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) is a serious and life-threatening condition. Many diagnostic procedures and tests are being used to detect the site of bleeding with different success rates. The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate accuracy of 64-slice multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of lower AGIB. Methods: Between September 2007 and January 2009, patients with presumed lower AGIB were referred to the radiology department of our institution for 64-slice MDCT examination as part of the investigation for the lower AGIB. Any abnormalities to account for bleeding, such as tumours, bowel wall enhancement and increased intraluminal density, were recorded. Results: Out of 139 patients with AGIB that were admitted to our casualty department, 27 patients (19 men and 8 women) in the age range of 24?88?years (mean age, 56?years) were suspected to have lower AGIB. Sixty-four-slice MDCT was performed and considered positive for bleeding in 19 (70%) cases, and in all the cases, the bleeding source was indentified in the arterial phase, showing a focal dense wall enhancement in 8 (42%) cases, circumferential wall enhancement in 4 (22%) cases and progressive increasing intraluminal density in 7 (36%) cases. The venous phase scan showed increased dispersion of the contrast within the lumen as an additional clue for active extravasation in 15 (79%) out of the 19 cases. Delayed 5-min scanning showed the same findings as venous phase in all the 19 positive cases and failed to depict any additional findings in the eight cases that were negative on arterial or venous phases. Conclusion: The study supports the high accuracy of 64-slice MDCT in locating the site of AGIB in patients thought to have a distal source of bleeding. Its accuracy in clinically proximal bleeding is not clear from this study, but MDCT is capable of showing such sources.

AB  - Objectives To report surgical technique, intra- and post-operative complications, and short- and long-term outcome following canine hepatobiliary surgery in which exposure of intra-abdominal hepatobiliary lesions was aided by diaphragmotomy. Materials and Methods Clinical records from four multi-disciplinary UK-based small animal referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed for dogs in which diaphragmotomy was performed between January 2014 and May 2019. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery performed, diaphragmotomy technique, management of diaphragmotomy and pneumothorax, intra- and post-operative complications, short-term outcome and long-term outcome were recorded. Results Thirty-one cases were identified. The most common hepatobiliary surgeries performed alongside diaphragmotomy were single hepatic lobectomy (14/31) and cholecystectomy (11/31). The most common diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (10/31), gall bladder mucocoele (7/31) and hepatic nodular hyperplasia (4/31). Peri-operative mortality rate was 9.7% (3/31 cases) though none of these deaths were considered attributable to diaphragmotomy. Post-operative complications were encountered in 67.9% (19/28) cases that survived the peri-operative period, of which 25.0% (7/28) suffered complications that were considered attributable or likely attributable to diaphragmotomy. These seven complications resolved following non-surgical intervention. Follow-up was available for 26 of 28 patients that survived to discharge at a median of 4-months (range 10?days to 24?months) following surgery and revealed no evidence of complications related to diaphragmotomy. Clinical Significance Diaphragmotomy appears safe and increases abdominal exposure of hepatobiliary lesions. The benefit of improved exposure must be carefully weighed up against the risks inherent in inducing pneumothorax.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

Methods Clinical data were collected from the records of three Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology services in South America and compared with those compiled from a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus). All cases were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD68 and S-100. Results The series comprised four females (80%) and one male (20%) with a mean age of 23.3 ± 10.9 years (range: 13-45 years). In four cases, there was involvement of the posterior region of the mandible (80%). The lesions presented radiographically as unilocular (60%) radiolucencies with punched-out margin (80%). All cases predominantly consisted of CD68-positive and S-100-negative xanthomatous cells. No recurrences were observed after curettage, with a median follow-up of 27 months. Conclusion Intraosseous xanthoma of the jaws is a rare benign disorder. We report here five additional cases affecting the mandible, for a total of 36 cases of the jaws reported in the literature. Overall, this lesion has predilection for posterior sites of the mandible of asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - Background:? There is a need for a better classification of the surgical pathology of diverticular disease treated by elective resection. Methods:? A prospective audit was conducted over a 25-year period, during which the surgeon studied the surgical pathology. The results of surgical treatment have been related to the pathology. Results:? Two hundred and six patients were managed by elective resection with a postoperative mortality of 1.0% and a total morbidity of 51.5%. The surgical pathology was classified as: non-inflammatory 25 (12.6%), localized diverticulitis 90 (43.7%) and extracolic diverticulitis 90 (44.2%). Conclusions:? This classification is useful to relate the technical requirements of surgery and the outcome to the surgical pathology. Postoperative morbidity is associated with the presence and severity of inflammatory pathology and therefore the casemix of any series will have a significant impact on this aspect.

AB  - Long-term survival was examined for 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID). The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a tentative understanding of the characteristics of the extreme traumas, elsewhere called ?complex PTSD?, that some refugees and asylum-seekers bring into therapy. It suggests that these kinds of traumas suffered during adulthood may involve a disintegration of the self and a loss of ?psychic skin?. This conceptualization is derived from the treatment of a refugee who survived multiple extreme traumas and with whom efforts were made in therapy to identify a complex methodology making use of supplementary therapeutic tools in addition to individual psychotherapy. The case demonstrates how the disintegration of self implies not only a deep somato-psychic dissociation, but also a loss of intrapsychic and interpersonal space. In the treatment this was worked through via repetition of the victim-aggressor dynamics at multiple levels. In the end, the therapeutic context was structured like a set of concentric layers, creating a ?bandage? over the patient's wounds whilst his ?psychic skin? was able to regenerate. The conditions triggered by extreme traumas in refugees challenge some of the cornerstones of individual psychoanalytic technique, as well as the idea that individual therapy may be thought of as existing in an environmental vacuum.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Aims Calcium dyshomeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. However, much of the previous research has focused on changes in neuronal calcium signalling. In a recent microarray study we identified dysregulation of several key signalling pathways including the Ca2+ signalling pathway in astrocytes as Alzheimer-type pathology developed. In this study we sought to determine the expression of calpain-10 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase alpha (CamKIIα) in relation to Alzheimer-type pathology in a population-based study. Methods Using post mortem temporal cortex samples derived from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) ageing brain cohort we examined calpain-10 and CamKIIα gene and protein expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Results We demonstrate that astrocytic expression of calpain-10 is up-regulated, and CamKIIα down-regulated with increasing Braak stage. Using immunohistochemistry we confirm protein expression of calpain-10 in astrocytes throughout the temporal cortex and demonstrate that calpain-10 immunoreactivity is correlated with both local and global measures of Alzheimer-type pathology. In addition, we identify a subpopulation of calpain-10 immunoreactive interlaminar astrocytes that extend processes deep into the cortex. CamKIIα is predominantly neuronal in localization and is associated with the presence of diffuse plaques in the ageing brain. Discussion Dysregulated expression of key calcium signalling molecules occurs with progression of Alzheimer-type pathology in the ageing brain, highlighting the need for further functional studies of astrocytic calcium signalling with respect to disease progression.
