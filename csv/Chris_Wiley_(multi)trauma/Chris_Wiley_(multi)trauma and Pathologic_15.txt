AB  - Abstract Aims Alcohol can induce diverse serious pathologies, yet this complexity may be obscured when alcohol-related deaths are classified according to a single underlying cause. We sought to quantify this issue and its implications for analysing mortality data. Design, Setting and Participants Cross-sectional study included 554 men aged 25?54 in Estonia undergoing forensic autopsy in 2008?09. Measurements Potentially alcohol-related pathologies were identified following macroscopic and histological examination. Alcohol biomarkers levels were determined. For a subset (26%), drinking behaviour was provided by next-of-kin. The Estonian Statistics Office provided underlying cause of death. Findings Most deaths (75%) showed evidence of potentially alcohol-related pathologies, and 32% had pathologies in two or more organs. The liver was most commonly affected [60.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?56.3?64.6] followed by the lungs (18.6%, 95% CI?=?15.4?22.1), stomach (17.5%, 95% CI?=?14.4?20.9), pancreas (14.1%, 95% CI?=?11.3?17.3), heart (4.9%, 95% CI?=?3.2?7.0) and oesophagus (1.4%, 95% CI?=?0.6?2.8). Only a minority with liver pathology had a second pathology. The number of pathologies correlated with alcohol biomarkers (phosphatidylethanol, gamma-glytamyl transpeptidase in blood, ethylglucuronide, ethylsulphate in urine). Despite the high prevalence of liver pathology, few deaths had alcoholic liver disease specified as the underlying cause. Conclusion The majority of 554 men aged 25?54 undergoing forensic autopsy in Estonia in 2008?09 showed evidence of alcohol-related pathology. However, the recording of deaths by underlying cause failed to capture the scale and nature of alcohol-induced pathologies found.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) trauma often occurs in combination with injury to the articular cartilage of the knee, this can result in earlier radiographic evidence of post traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee compared to the contralateral, ACL intact knee; however, the biomechanical and biological mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of this disease are not understood. We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms by determining the relationship between articular cartilage injury associated with ACL trauma and the expression of synovial fluid biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism, and to evaluate the relationship between these biomarkers and the patient's perspective of the outcomes. Synovial fluid samples were acquired from 39 ACL injured subjects at an average of 10 weeks after injury, and 32 control subjects with normal knees (documented with clinical exam and MRI assessment). Subjects in the ACL-injured group were classified as low-risk for future OA if they displayed an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grade 2 articular cartilage lesion or less and high-risk for future OA if they had an ICRS Grade 3A articular cartilage lesion. The patient's perspective of the injury was evaluated with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS). There were no significant differences in mean concentrations of the markers of type II collagen metabolism (CPII, C2C, and C1,2C) or the aggrecan breakdown Alanine?Arginine?Glycine?Serine (ARGS) -fragment between control subjects and the subjects in the low- and high-risk groups (p-value range: 0.80?0.43). Associations between ARGS-aggrecan concentration and KOOS subscales of symptoms and pain were significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.03 and p?=?0.01, respectively). Likewise, there was strong evidence in support of an association between the markers of type II collagen metabolism (C1,2C and CPII concentrations) and the KOOS subscale of pain between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.051 and 0.077, correspondingly). In ACL injured subjects with concomitant Grade 3A articular cartilage injuries, concentrations of synovial fluid ARGS-aggrecan were directly associated with improvements in KOOS symptoms and pain. These findings suggest the possible involvement of ARGS-aggrecan in a localized tissue repair response involving an increase in aggrecan turnover following severe knee trauma. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine the population of patients where patient transfer may be prevented by assessment of a senior ED registrar at the referring hospital. Methods Patients transferred from Caulfield Hospital, specialising in community services, rehabilitation, aged care and aged mental health to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre, an adult major referral centre within the same clinical network were identified from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016. Medical records were reviewed independently by two clinicians to determine preventability of transfer and whether attendance by a senior ED registrar could have prevented the transfer. Results There were 221 patients included with a mean age of 73.6(15.1) years. The median time spent in the ED was 4 h (interquartile range 2?8) and 197 (89.1%) were admitted. There were 107 (48.6%) transfers deemed preventable or potentially preventable, with 104 preventable by attendance of a senior ED registrar. The most common indication for transfer was acute trauma (n =?55; 24.9%), and the odds of a case being preventable or potentially preventable if transferred for the primary indication of trauma was 3.9 (95% confidence interval 2.1?7.1; P < 0.001). Among the preventable cases, the total cost of transfer was AU$105?984 over 6 months, not accounting for the costs of duplication of care. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study suggests that strategies to expand the provision of acute care to outreach within specialist networks and reduce patient transfers should be further explored. An outreach programme for improved acute assessment of patients at the referring hospital particularly after acute trauma may prevent transfers, improving care pathways.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Abdominal metastases (AM) from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are rare and prognosis is poor. The aims of the study were to (a) identify risk factors for the development of AM and to (b) investigate the outcome of AM-patients. Methods Seven-hundred-sixty-nine STS-patients with localised disease at diagnosis treated at three tumour centres (2000-2016) were retrospectively included (409 males; mean age, 55.6 years [range, 8-96 years]; median follow-up, 4.1 years [interquartile-range, 2.5-6.6 years]). Results Two-hundred-two patients (26.3%) developed secondary metastases, and 24 of them AM (3.1%). Ten patients developed first AM (FAM) after a mean of 2.4 years and 14 patients late AM (LAM, after being diagnosed with metastases to other sites) after a mean of 2.0 years. Patients with liposarcoma had a significantly higher risk of developing AM (P?=?.007), irrespective of grading. There was no difference in post-metastasis-survival (PMS) between patients with AM at any time point and those with metastases to other sites (P?=?.585). Patients with LAM or FAM showed no difference in post-abdominal-metastasis-survival (P?=?.884). Conclusions Survival in patients with AM is poor, irrespective of whether they develop secondarily to other metastases or not. Patients at high-risk of AM (ie, liposarcoma) may be followed-up regularly by abdominal-ultrasound/CT.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To describe the clinical signs, management, histopathologic findings, and outcome of three dogs with a corneocentric presentation of nodular granulomatous episcleritis (NGE). Methods Three dogs of varying breeds were presented for a unilateral, nonpainful, and infiltrative corneal lesion in the dorsal aspect of the eye. Clinical response to symptomatic topical treatment directed at a presumed inflammatory or immune-mediated cause was poor. Due to this, and concerns of neoplasia, ultrasonography (n = 1), incisional biopsy (n = 2), and/or enucleation (n = 2) were performed. Results The inflammatory infiltrate observed on histopathology was identical to that seen in nodular granulomatous episcleritis in all three cases. However, atypically the inflammation was confined to the cornea and limbus, without episcleral or conjunctival involvement. Inflammation of the cornea was full thickness to Descemet's membrane. Following enucleation (n = 2), there were no postoperative complications, and no reported ophthalmic disease in the remaining eye. Currently, the single non-enucleated case remains controlled with systemic and topical immunosuppression. Conclusion To the best of the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an NGE condition purely affecting the full thickness of the cornea, without episcleral or conjunctival involvement. The authors propose this to represent an atypical corneocentric variant of NGE. This clinical presentation can resemble neoplasia; incisional biopsy is recommended for a definitive diagnosis. Further research into the optimal treatment strategies for this variant of NGE is required.

In pathological forms of tremor one or more central oscillating generators are assumed and dysfunctioning of the neuronal motor circuits and the role of the cerebellum will be discussed. The pathophysiological mechanisms of myoclonus will be explained on the anatomical classification with a focus on the functional aspects. Differences between cortical and subcortical myoclonus will be discussed, as the spinal cord and peripheral types of myoclonus. Chorea originates probably from a dysfunction of complex neuronal networks consisting of the basal ganglia and different motor cortical areas. A review is given of latest findings of molecular pathological studies of HD.

AB  - In recent years, a number of family therapists have conceptualized psychotherapy as a dialogical activity. This view presents family therapy researchers with specific challenges, the most important of which is to find ways of dealing with the dialogical qualities of the multi-actor dialogues that occur, for example, in family therapeutic conversations. In this article, we propose some preliminary ideas concerning qualitative investigations of multi-actor dialogues. Our aim is to work toward an integration of Bakhtin?s theoretical concepts with good practices in qualitative research (e.g., dialogical tools and concepts of a narrative processes coding system) in order to make sense of family therapy dialogues. A specific method that we have called Dialogical Methods for Investigations of Happening of Change is described. This method allows for a general categorization of the qualities of responsive dialogues in a single session, and also for a detailed focus on particular sequences through a microanalysis of specific topical episodes. The particular focus is on the voices present in the utterances, the positioning of each speaker, and the addressees of the utterances. The method is illustrated via an analysis of a couple therapy session with a depressed woman and her husband.

Experimental Design: Healthy control subjects (n?=?17) were scanned at 7 T using a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence and susceptibility-weighted magnitude images, and QS maps were reconstructed. We defined a hippocampal subfield labeling protocol for the magnitude image produced from the average of all echoes and assessed reproducibility through volume and shape metrics. A group-wise diffeomorphic registration procedure was used to generate an average atlas of the subfields for the whole subject cohort. The quantitative MRI maps and subfield labels were then warped to the average atlas space and used to measure mean values of and QS characterizing each subfield. Principal Observations: We were able to reliably label hippocampal subfields on the multi-echo susceptibility images. The group-averaged atlas accurately aligns these structures to produce a high-resolution depiction of the subfields, allowing assessment of both quantitative susceptibility and across subjects. Our analysis of variance demonstrates that there are more apparent differences between the subfields on these quantitative maps than the normalized magnitude images. Conclusion: We constructed a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields for use in voxel-based studies and demonstrated in vivo quantification of susceptibility and in the subfields.

AB  - Abstract The current chapter aims to examine personality pathology across the life span within a developmental psychopathology framework. Specifically, the chapter covers multiple aspects and issues within the domain of personality disorder with a focus on childhood/adolescence and later life. We define and briefly review the life span development of normal-range personality. We then define and review longitudinal studies of personality disorder and summarize critical measurement issues for PDs in early and later life. We then review empirical literature (for early and later life) organized within four core components of personality pathology: traits, emotions, relationships, and identity. We review literature relevant for four critical developmental periods for personality pathology: infancy?toddlerhood, middle childhood?early adolescence, late adolescence?early adulthood, and later adulthood. Finally, we offer a general summary and highlight some future directions for the study of personality pathology in childhood and adolescence and in older adults.

Imaging TBI -? Focal and diffuse TBI: separate entities? ?? Pathophysiological mechanisms of focal injury -? The essentials: glutamate and Ca2+ ?? Pathophysiological mechanisms of diffuse injury -? A heterogeneous cascade of changes -? After axonal disconnection ?? Conclusions Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent and clinically highly heterogeneous neurological disorder with large socioeconomic consequences. TBI severity classification, based on the hospital admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ranges from mild (GCS 13?15) and moderate (GCS 9?12) to severe (GCS ≤ 8). The GCS reflects the risk of dying from TBI, which is low after mild (?1%), intermediate after moderate (up to 15%) and high (up to 40%) after severe TBI. Intracranial damage can be focal, such as epidural and subdural haematomas and parenchymal contusions, or diffuse, for example traumatic axonal injury and diffuse cerebral oedema, although this distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Study of the cellular and molecular post-traumatic processes is essential for the understanding of TBI pathophysiology but even more to find therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs to be eventually used in human beings. To date, studies in vitro and in vivo, mainly in animals but also in human beings, are unravelling the pathological TBI mechanisms at high pace. Nevertheless, TBI pathophysiology is all but completely elucidated. Neuroprotective treatment studies in human beings have been disappointing thus far and have not resulted in commonly accepted drugs. This review presents an overview on the clinical aspects and the pathophysiology of focal and diffuse TBI, and it highlights several acknowledged important events that occur on molecular and cellular level after TBI.

AB  - Abstract Aim Our primary aim was to calculate the head computed tomography (CT) scan rate in children with a minor head injury (MHI) when the Dutch National guidelines were followed in clinical practice. The secondary aim was to determine the incidence of CT abnormalities and the guideline predictors associated with traumatic abnormalities. Methods We performed a multi-centre, prospective observational cross-sectional study in the emergency departments of six hospitals in The Netherlands between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2016. Results Data on 1002 patients were studied and 69% of cases complied with the guidelines. The overall CT rate was 44% and the incidence of traumatic abnormal CT findings was 13%. CT scans were performed in 19% of children under two years of age, 48% of children between two and five years and 63% of children aged six years or more. Multivariate regression analysis for all age categories showed that CT abnormalities were predicted by a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, suspicion of a basal skull fracture, vomiting and scalp haematomas or external lesions of the skull. Conclusion Strict adherence to the Dutch national guidelines resulted in CT overuse. New guidelines are needed to safely reduce CT scan indications.

AB  - Abstract Degenerative sacroiliac joint disease is a cause of lumbosacral pain in dogs; however, published information on cross-sectional imaging characteristics is limited. Objectives of this retrospective, secondary analysis, methods-comparison study were to test hypotheses that CT lesions reported in humans with degenerative sacroiliac joint disease are also present in dogs, and that CT is comparable to gross pathology for detecting these lesions. Matched CT and gross pathology slice images of 30 sacroiliac joints were retrieved from a previous prospective, canine cadaver study. A veterinary radiologist interpreted randomized CT images for each joint based on previously published CT characteristics of lesions in humans with degenerative sacroiliac joint disease. A veterinary pathologist independently interpreted randomized gross pathology images using the same criteria. All joints had at least one CT lesion consistent with degenerative sacroiliac joint disease. A new CT lesion was also identified and termed ?subarticular cleft.? The CT and gross pathology methods agreed for detecting joints with subchondral sclerosis, subchondral erosion, and intra-articular ankylosis lesions (P > .05, McNemar's test), but disagreed for detection of joints with subchondral cyst, para-articular ankylosis, and subarticular cleft lesions (P ≤ .05). Using gross pathology as the reference standard, CT had 100% sensitivity for detection of subarticular cleft and subchondral cyst lesions, with 56% and 22% specificity, respectively. Para-articular ankylosis lesions were detected by CT but not by gross pathology. Findings supported the hypothesis that CT lesions reported in humans with degenerative sacroiliac joint disease are also present in dogs, and partially supported the hypothesis that CT is comparable to gross pathology for detecting joints with these lesions.

AB  - Abstract Physiological aging affects brain structure and function impacting morphology, connectivity, and performance. However, whether some brain connectivity metrics might reflect the age of an individual is still unclear. Here, we collected brain images from healthy participants (N?=?155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices, both data sets combined to obtain different connectivity features. We then calculated the brain connectome age?an age estimator resulting from a multi-scale methodology applied to the structure?function connectome, and compared it to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were twofold. First, we found that aging widely affects the connectivity of multiple structures, such as anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus, and temporal pole. Second, we found that the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas, also known as the fronto-striato-thalamic (FST) circuit, makes the major contribution to age estimation. In conclusion, our results highlight the key role played by the FST circuit in the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied to identify the structural?functional connectivity patterns correlating to other biomarkers than ChA.

AB  - Abstract Background The management of hepatic hemangiomas remains ill defined. This study sought to investigate the indications, surgical management and outcomes of patients who underwent a resection for hepatic hemangiomas. Methods A retrospective review from six major liver centres in the United States identifying patients who underwent surgery for hepatic hemangiomas was performed. Clinico-pathological, treatment and peri-operative data were evaluated. Results Of the 241patients who underwent a resection, the median age was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39?53] and 85.5% were female. The median hemangioma size was 8.5?cm (IQR: 6?12.1). Surgery was performed for abdominal symptoms (85%), increasing hemangioma size (11.3%) and patient anxiety (3.7%). Life-threatening complications necessitating a hemangioma resection occurred in three patients (1.2%). Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications occurred in 14 patients (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.8% (n = 2). Of patients with abdominal symptoms, 63.2% reported improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Conclusion A hemangioma resection can be safely performed at high-volume institutions. The primary indication for surgery remains for intractable symptoms. The development of severe complications associated with non-operative management remains a rare event, ultimately challenging the necessity of additional surgical indications for a hemangioma resection.

AB  - Background and Objectives Pathological and problem gambling may be common yet frequently undetected conditions in substance use treatment. This paper reports findings on the prevalence of gambling comorbidities in these clinical contexts that are generalizable across regions and settings. It indicates the implications of such conditions for treatment of substance use problems. Methods A U.S. representative sample of n?=?402 patients reporting past-year treatment for substance use problems was derived from wave 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Weighted prevalence estimates were produced and regression analyses used to examine correlates of gambling symptoms. Results Rates of lifetime pathological gambling (5+ DSM-IV symptoms) and problem gambling (3+ DSM-IV symptoms) were 4.3% (s.e.?=?1.3%) and 7.2% (s.e.?=?1.6%), respectively. Lifetime gambling symptoms were associated with Axis II disorders, but no Axis I diagnoses. There was limited evidence of associations with substance usage, mental or physical health and medical utilization. There were associations with financial crises and relationship breakdown, during and after treatment. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Gambling problems are elevated in substance use treatment but may be less common than previously thought; when considered nationally and across clinical settings. They may have modest associations with clinical characteristics given high levels of psychiatric severity that characterise treatment seeking samples overall. Notwithstanding, the results suggest that gambling comorbidities should be standard considerations in substance use treatment. They may signal complex conditions characterised by pervasive underlying psychopathology, and psychosocial difficulties that accumulate over time. (Am J Addict 2015;24:467 ?474)

AB  - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a non-invasive method in detecting abnormal spectra of various brain metabolites containing N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), Creatine (Cr), ?-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Glutamate. Technical processing of the MR-systems, improved automated shimming methods and further development of special shim coils increase the magnetic field homogeneity and lead to a better spectral quality and spectral resolution. The handling of the systems becomes more user-friendly and is more likely to be used in routine diagnostics. The 1H-MRS has become a diagnostic tool for assessing a number of diseases of the central nervous system mainly including epilepsies and brain tumours. The role of 1H-MRS in the assessment of epilepsies will probably increase in future. In the following article, the principles of 1H-MRS and an overview of it in the evaluation and treatment of epilepsies with special regard to temporal lobe epilepsies (TLE) has been illustrated.

AB  - Summary Interpretation of cervical radiographs can be challenging due to the complex anatomy and superimposition of osseous structures on either side of the vertebrae. This report describes the investigation of neck pain in a Thoroughbred gelding following a traumatic fall. Several imaging modalities were used to demonstrate the presence of a fracture of the left cranial articular process of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), including nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography, oblique radiographic projections and a novel cineradiographic technique. Oblique radiographs were superior to standard lateral-lateral radiographs in both the diagnosis and for monitoring the progression of healing of the articular process fracture in this case.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole in dogs with diagnosis of meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology. Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.
