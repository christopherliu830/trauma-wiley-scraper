AB  - Objectives To verify retrospectively the margin status and analyse the location and characteristics of positive surgical margins (PSMs) in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP), by a central pathology review, based on the consensus conference 2009 updated margin criteria from the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP). Patients and Methods The detailed PSM characteristics of 441 patients who underwent laparoscopic RP (LRP) between 1999 and 2007 were centrally reviewed with regard to location, number, Gleason score at the PSM and tumour width. Predictors of PSMs and the impact of several PSM characteristics on clinical outcomes were examined. Patient characteristics were compared using the chi-squared test. Differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were analysed using the log-rank test and presented as Kaplan?Meier survival curves. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis for the prediction of RFS was performed. Results Central pathology review using the updated PSM definition according to ISUP 2009, resulted in reclassification of a substantial number of patients with PSMs (n = 113, 26.6%) as R0. Several PSM characteristics with a higher risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) were identified as the strongest independent predictors of RFS: pathological stage; Gleason score; and the presence of multiple PSMs (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08?2.96; P = 0.025). Further analysis replacing the location of PSM by the width categories of PSM showed that a PSM >3 mm was an independent predictor of RFS (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.08?2.72; P = 0.022). Conclusions The impact of PSMs after LRP for prostate cancer remains unclear. PSMs in the present cohort of patients undergoing LRP had different characteristics and conferred different risks of BCR. A better understanding of PSM characteristics and a careful standardized pathological evaluation is needed to adequately counsel patients with respect to prognosis and adjuvant therapy after LRP.

To quantify the impact of edentulousness on residual ridge volume, denture stomatitis (DS), as well as oral health behaviours among geriatric denture-wearers. Background:? Residual ridge resorption (RRR) is the primary intraoral complication of complete edentulism, but individual variation among geriatric patients has been observed. Materials and methods:? Data collection relied upon a 10-year retrospective chart review of all complete denture-wearing geriatric patients presenting at the Removable Prosthodontics Clinic, Dental School of Athens, between 1993 and 2002. Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on ordinal logistic regression. Results:? A total of 873 records of geriatric patients (age mean?=?72; median?=?70; range?=?65?95) comprised our analytical sample. Subjects? mean (SD) time since edentulation was 7.7 (10.2) years. Eleven percent were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). While 28% of patients reported cleaning their dentures at least daily, 6% presented with denture stomatitis (DS). Each added year of edentulism increased the odds of mandibular RRR: OR (95% CI)?=?1.05 (1.03, 1.07). Nightly denture wear was the strongest risk factor for DS. Finally, independent of age and sex, each year of being edentulous increased the odds of presenting with TMD: OR (95% CI)?=?1.03 (1.01, 1.05). Conclusion:? Time since edentulation was strongly associated with mandibular but not maxillary RRR, as well as TMD development.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Polyheal compared with surgery in treating chronic wounds with exposed bones and/or tendons (EB&T) due to trauma in France, Germany and the UK, from the perspective of the payers. Decision models were constructed depicting the management of chronic wounds with EB&T and spanned the period up to healing or up to 1 year. The models considered the decision by a plastic surgeon to treat these wounds with Polyheal or surgery and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of Polyheal at 2010/2011 prices. Using Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to increase the probability of healing from 0·93 to 0·98 and lead to a total health-care cost of ?7984, ?7517 and ?8860 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Management with surgery is expected to lead to a total health-care cost of ?12 300, ?18 137 and ?11 330 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Hence, initial treatment with Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to lead to a 5% improvement in the probability of healing and a substantial decrease in health-care costs of 35%, 59% and 22% in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Within the models' limitations, Polyheal potentially affords the public health-care system in France, Germany and the UK a cost-effective treatment for chronic wounds with EB&T due to trauma, when compared with surgery. However, this will be dependent on Polyheal's healing rate in clinical practice when it becomes routinely available.

AB  - Ligneous conjunctivitis and gingivitis were diagnosed in three related Scottish terrier dogs presented for investigation of severe conjunctivitis and respiratory signs. Hypoplasminogenaemia was confirmed in one of the three affected dogs. Supportive treatment was not effective, and the dogs died or were euthanased because of the disease. Post-mortem analysis of two of the dogs revealed multiple abnormalities including severe proliferative fibrinous lesions affecting the conjunctiva, gingiva, trachea, larynx and epicardium and multiple fibrous adhesions throughout the thoracic and abdominal cavities. One dog had internal hydrocephalus and lacked a cerebellar vermis. Ligneous membranitis was confirmed on histopathology. This is a rare condition in dogs but an important differential diagnosis for severe conjunctivitis and gingivitis.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To identify the possible risk factors for implant failure and peri-implant pathology in a population of systemically compromised patients. Materials and Methods This retrospective clinical study included a total of 721 systemically compromised patients (422 women, 299 men), with an average age of 51 years (range: 20 to 87) rehabilitated with dental implants. The average follow-up time was 7.3 years. The patients? demographic variables (age and gender) and clinical variables (implant location, type of implant surface, and systemic conditions) were recorded. Outcome measures were implant failure and peri-implant pathology. Binary logistic regression models were performed to investigate the effect of the patients? demographic and clinical characteristics on the dependent variables implant failure and peri-implant pathology. A linear regression model was performed to correlate the patient's characteristics with the number of failed implants. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding levels of significance were estimated for each variable. Results Multivariate logistic regression disclosed increased age (patients over 40 years of age) as a risk factor for implant failure (OR = 2.63) and hepatitis as a risk factor for peri-implant pathology (OR = 3.74). Multivariate linear regression disclosed rheumatologic and cardiac diseases to be correlated with a higher number of failed implants. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, the results suggest no absolute contraindications for implant rehabilitation in a population of systemically compromised patients. Nevertheless, this study suggests that increasing age, rheumatological condition, cardiovascular condition, and hepatitis should be considered when performing implant-supported rehabilitations due to their negative influence on the outcome.

AB  - A case of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in a six-month-old male Maremma shepherd dog is reported. The dog was referred with a four month history of progressive weakness and depression with loss of trained habits. Tendency to recumbency, disorientation, visual impairment, bilaterally decreased menace response and hindlimb conscious proprioception deficits were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse hypointense signal involving the cerebral grey matter with enlargement of the cerebral sulci on T1-weighted and fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences consistent with a diffuse necrosis or atrophy of the cortical grey matter. Histological examination revealed severe inflammatory infiltration mainly composed of eosinophils and macrophages in the subarachnoid space and in the superficial layer of the cerebral cortex where parenchymal rarefaction and necrosis of neurones were also evident. No parasites, cysts or fungi were detected, and an immunologically mediated disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging may represent a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis from other inflammatory brain diseases of young dogs.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socioeconomic problem throughout the world. It is a complicated pathological process that consists of primary insults and a secondary insult characterized by a set of biochemical cascades. The imbalance between a higher energy demand for repair of cell damage and decreased energy production led by mitochondrial dysfunction aggravates cell damage. At the cellular level, the main cause of the secondary deleterious cascades is cell damage that is centred in the mitochondria. Excitotoxicity, Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Bcl-2 family, caspases and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) are the main participants in mitochondria-centred cell damage following TBI. Some preclinical and clinical results of mitochondria-targeted therapy show promise. Mitochondria- targeted multipotential therapeutic strategies offer new hope for the successful treatment of TBI and other acute brain injuries.

AB  - Abstract Mouse spinal cord (SC) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides important information on tissue morphology and structural changes that may occur during pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or SC injury. The acquisition scheme of the commonly used DWI techniques is based on conventional spin-echo encoding, which is time-consuming. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the use of echo planar imaging (EPI) would provide good-quality diffusion MR images of mouse SC, as well as accurate measurements of diffusion-derived metrics, and thus enable diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and highly resolved DWI within reasonable scan times. A four-shot diffusion-weighted spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) sequence was evaluated at 11.75?T on a group of healthy mice (n?=?10). SE-EPI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients of gray and white matter were compared with those obtained using a conventional spin-echo sequence (c-SE) to validate the accuracy of the method. To take advantage of the reduction in acquisition time offered by the EPI sequence, multi-slice DTI acquisitions were performed covering the cervical segments (six slices, six diffusion-encoding directions, three b values) within 30?min (vs 2?h for c-SE). From these measurements, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivities were calculated, and fiber tracking along the C1 to C6 cervical segments was performed. In addition, high-resolution images (74???94?µm2) were acquired within 5?min per direction. Clear delineation of gray and white matter and identical apparent diffusion coefficient values were obtained, with a threefold reduction in acquisition time compared with c-SE. While overcoming the difficulties associated with high spatially and temporally resolved DTI measurements, the present SE-EPI approach permitted identification of reliable quantitative parameters with a reproducibility compatible with the detection of pathologies. The SE-EPI method may be particularly valuable when multiple sets of images from the SC are needed, in cases of rapidly evolving conditions, to decrease the duration of anesthesia or to improve MR exploration by including additional MR measurements.

AB  - Abstract This article discusses critically the focus on stress symptoms when treating traumatized refugees. It describes common challenges that practitioners meet, when working with extreme trauma. It suggests three concepts that might help to understand the complicated dynamics of severe traumatization. These concepts deal as well with the nature of post-traumatic problems as with the way they might be treated. A clinical case is used to exemplify and discuss the concepts. Finally the article offers some thoughts on the special dynamics of the situation of refugees.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between farming and cancer risk was investigated in an integrated series of case-control studies conducted from 1985 to 1991 in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, north-east Italy. Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, thyroid gland, kidney and urinary tract, bladder, prostate, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myelomas, and controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, were interviewed. For males, a significantly elevated relative risk was seen for oral cavity and pharynx. Farming, however, was associated with a significant protection against cancer of the colon and rectum and bladder. In females, only one significant association emerged, for multiple myeloma. A few significant interactions between cancer risk and year of birth (i.e., before 1930 or 1930 and after) were observed. The risk of cancer of the larynx was significantly elevated in younger male farmers but not in older ones. Our multi-site case-control study confirms that farmers have, for some cancer sites, a distinctive pattern. Excesses of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in farmers are characteristic of the present study area and, possibly, of similar European rural populations who have in common high levels of alcohol consumption and, at least in the past, unbalanced diets.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective Yiqifumai injection is a compound Chinese medicine used to treat microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases clinically. Our previous study proved that Yiqifumai injection pretreatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced venular albumin leakage in rat mesentery. This study aimed to investigate whether Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability and corresponding contribution of its main ingredients. Methods Rats were challenged by lipopolysaccharide infusion (5 mg/kg/h) for 90 minutes. Yiqifumai injection (160 mg/kg/h), Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h), Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h), and Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h) + Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h) were infused 30 minutes before (pretreatment) or after (post-treatment) lipopolysaccharide administration. Results Both pretreatment and post-treatment with Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral venular albumin leakage during lipopolysaccharide infusion and cerebrovascular hyperpermeability at 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide infusion. Yiqifumai injection restrained the decreased junction protein expression, adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria complex I, II, IV, and V activities. Moreover, Yiqifumai injection inhibited toll-like receptor-4 expression, Src phosphorylation, and caveolin-1 expression. Its main ingredients Rb1 and Sch alone worked differently, with Rb1 being more effective for enhancing energy metabolism, while Sch attenuating toll-like receptor-4 expression and Src activation. Conclusion Yiqifumai injection exerts a protective and ameliorated effect on cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability, which is more effective than any of its ingredients, possibly due to the interaction of its main ingredients through a multi-pathway mode.
