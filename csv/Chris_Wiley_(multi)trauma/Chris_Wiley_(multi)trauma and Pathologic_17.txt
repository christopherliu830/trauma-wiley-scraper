AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its associated concussion are major causes of disability and death. All ages can be affected but children, young adults and the elderly are particularly susceptible. A decline in mortality has resulted in many more individuals living with a disability caused by TBI including those affecting vision. This review describes: (1) the major clinical and pathological features of TBI; (2) the visual signs and symptoms associated with the disorder; and (3) discusses the assessment of quality of life and visual rehabilitation of the patient. Defects in primary vision such as visual acuity and visual fields, eye movement including vergence, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements, and in more complex aspects of vision involving visual perception, motion vision (?akinopsia?), and visuo-spatial function have all been reported in TBI. Eye movement dysfunction may be an early sign of TBI. Hence, TBI can result in a variety of visual problems, many patients exhibiting multiple visual defects in combination with a decline in overall health. Patients with chronic dysfunction following TBI may require occupational, vestibular, cognitive and other forms of physical therapy. Such patients may also benefit from visual rehabilitation, including reading-related oculomotor training and the prescribing of spectacles with a variety of tints and prism combinations.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of multi-family therapy at reducing the addiction severity and at improving the psychological and family dynamics of opiate addicts receiving methadone treatment at a public treatment center. The study compares multi-family therapy with a reflecting team (MFT-RT) and a standard treatment following a methadone maintenance treatment program. The results show that multi-family therapy with a reflecting team effectively reduces the addiction severity in several of the areas evaluated and noted that this effect is superior to standard treatment. The psychotherapy patients showed improvement in the areas of employment and social support; their drug use diminished and their psychiatric condition improved. At the same time, they needed a lower daily dose of methadone. In addition, the group undergoing standard treatment showed a noteworthy deterioration in their medical condition. Both groups showed a significant increase in their alcohol use. When applied to family treatments, the systemic-constructivist approach by the reflecting team offers combined techniques that can help improve care for the families of patients with addiction problems.

AB  - Canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. A retrospective study was undertaken of all dogs that were presented between January 1999 and January 2004 to the Animal Health Trust for the treatment of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. Five cases were identified, and their median survival time was 211 days (95 per cent confidence interval 80 to 352) with two of the five dogs remaining alive at the end of the study, 826 and 1628 days from diagnosis with no clinical signs of disease. The protocol was well tolerated with only one of the five dogs showing toxicity associated with carboplatin and all dogs that started radiotherapy completing it. Compared with results of previous studies, these cases suggest that surgical cytoreduction followed by coarse fractionated radiotherapy together with carboplatin may be a useful way to treat this tumour. Carboplatin alone caused partial remission in the two cases where it was used as neo-adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the utility of multimodal quantitative MRI (qMRI) and atlas-based methods to identify characteristics of lesion-driven injury and neurodegeneration in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25?58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Purpose: The pathophysiology and clinical phenomenology of epileptic psychoses are wide and varied, and an internationally accepted classification system has yet to be established. A multi-axial classification should be developed to capture the complexity of clinicai situations and to describe the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis. We propose a new 5-axial classification system based on a review of the previous literature and evaluate its validity and applicability in Japan by a multi-institutional design. Methods: According to the ICD-10 guidelines, psychosis is defined as the presence of hallucination, delusions, or a limited number of behavioral abnormalities, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behavior, without disturbance of consciousness. Among the patients with epilepsy and psy- choses treated by the authors at 6 epilepsy clinics, 128 patients were randomly selected to participate as subjects. Those patients who developed epilepsy after the onset of their psychoses were excluded. The average age of the subjects was 39.4 years, average age of onset of epilepsy was 13.3 years, and average age of onset of psychoses was 27.9 years. Results: The first axis codes the type of epilepsy and laterality of epileptic focus. Temporal lobe epilepsy (48%) and other localization-related epilepsies (14%) were prevalent, but all types of epilepsy were seen. Left-sided (29%) and right-sided foci (27%) were in equal proportion, and bilateral foci (9%) also were found. The second axis codes the type of psychoses and clinical course. Paranoid schizophrenia-like disorder (41%) and delusional disorder (19%) were prevalent; whereas acute transient psychotic disorder (9%), catatonic disorder (7%), hallucinosis (6%), and hebephrenic schizophrenia-like disorder (4%) were relatively infrequent. Single episode (24%), recurrent episodes (34%), and chronic course (34%) were found in almost equal proportion. Therc were several cases with chronic course after recurrent episodes (3%). The third axis codes the temporal relationship between seizure occurrence and EEG changes during psychoses. lnterictal onset (69%) was most frequent followed by postictal (15%), para-ictal (6%), and other (5%). EEG changes during psychoses were seen in 38%, and normalization of the EEG was seen in 4%of patients. In 22%, EEG could not be recorded during psychoses (22%). The fourth axis codes the precipitating factors of psychoses. Specific personality trait (20%), changes in drug-regimen (l4%), co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders (12%), and psychosocial factors (10%) were seen. The fifth axis codes the organic background. Abnormal findings by brain imaging techniques (38%). mild intelligence deficiency (30%), and previous history of brain damage (27%) were noted. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate the heterogeneity of epileptic psychoses. We have proposed a 5-axial classification that appears to provide a convenient format for organizing and communicating clinical information to assist clinical practice and facilitate research. Using those guidelines, we may be able to improve our under- standing of the pathogenesis, develop suitable treatment, predict the prognosis, and ultimately establish appropriate intervention strategies.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been known to play an important role in pathological conditions, specifically in response to inflammation, infection and injury to cells. Recently, several research teams have been interested in investigating its association with cognition during the progression of pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that LCN2 is not correlated with cognitive function under normal physiological conditions, although LCN2 has been negatively associated with cognition and some neuropathologies. Increasing LCN2 production is associated with reduced cognitive performance in a rodent model. However, further studies are needed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms of LCN2 on cognitive dysfunction, as well as its clinical relevance. This review aims to summarise the evidence available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies concerning the possible role of LCN2 on cognitive function following the onset of pathological conditions. Any contradictory evidence is also assessed and presented.

AB  - We report five cases of illicit injections of filler-substances for cosmetic purposes in non-medical clinics. The first two patients, a mother and 30-year-old daughter, presented with skin lesions in both legs after calf-augmentation by paraffin injection 4 years prior. One week later calf hyperpigmentation and induration developed, with progression up the legs, and eventual purulent draining ulceration (daughter). The third patient, a 34-year-old female, presented with pink-brown macules on both buttocks after receiving silicone injections 9 months earlier. The fourth patient, a 31-year-old female, developed skin lesions on the buttocks after silicone injections. The fifth patient, a 43-year-old female, developed sclerodermoid plaques on the buttocks after silicone injection. The first two biopsies showed large spaces in tissue, calcinosis cutis, dermal sclerosis, granulation tissue, and lymphedema. The third biopsy revealed foreign body reaction to non-polarizing material, the fourth lipogranulomatous reaction, and the fifth microvacuolar change with scar. Biopsies post-injection of cosmetic filler materials typically show macrovacuolar ?swiss cheese? changes, and later microvacuolar changes with considerable granulomatous reaction. The reactions here were clinically severe, and may reflect adulteration of injected materials. We believe these cases augur a public health epidemic given a proliferation of non-medical cosmetic ?mills? which offer illicit cosmetic procedures.

AB  - Summary The cervical spine is approached in two separate anatomic and functional regions: the craniocervical junction (occiput, C1 and C2) and the subaxial spine (C3 to C7). Injury to the craniocervical junction or cervical spine trauma is usually indirect, related to forces transmitted through the head. Current recommendations for initial imaging in adults with suspected cervical spine injury is a thin slice CT of the cervical spine. The most common fracture of C1 is a bilateral vertical fracture through the neural arch. Fractures of C2 may occur in isolation or in association with additional cervical spine fractures. The most common fracture of C2 involves the odontoid, followed by Hangman's fracture, anteroinferior endplate (hyperextension teardrop) and least commonly, isolated C2 body or posterior element fractures. A burst fracture commonly results from combined axial loading and flexion vector in C5, C6, and C7 locations. Compression fractures are common in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

AB  - Pathological changes of spinal vascular disease due to dissecting aortic aneurysm, atheroma emboli, cardiac arrest and pencil-shaped softening are described. Spinal cord damage in four patients who developed paraplegia secondary to the dissecting aortic aneurysm varied significantly from case to case. The extent of aortic dissection, the level of radicular artery, the vascular supply pattern in the transverse section of the spinal cord, and the vulnerability to ischemia were suggested to be very important factors contributing to the spinal cord damage. Atheroma emboli of spinal cord vessels were found in 7/604 autopsied cases. Atheroma emboli of spinal cord vessels is one cause of myelopathy in aged persons with hypertension, renal failure, myocardial infarction, or diabetis mellitus. Atheroma emboli were often observed at the vessels of lumbosacral segmental level. Necrosis of the spinal cord was only observed in two cases of atheroma emboli. Ischemic changes of the spinal cord were observed in 7/15 cases in which the cerebral cortex showed lamellar necrosis due to cardiac arrest. The damaged areas were found more predominantly in the lumbosacral segment. In the cross section, the area from the mid-portion of gray matter to the base of the posterior horn was predominantly affected. Histological findings of 13 cases of pencil-shaped softening, in which the spinal cord showed transverse necrosis by compression of extradural metastatic tumors are described. The continuity between the cavity of pencil-shaped softening, the area of transverse necrosis was confirmed. For the pathogenesis of pencil-shaped softening, mechanical compression was considered to be an important factor.

AB  - After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R), many studies have reported a deficit of performance on the injured leg during multi-joint tasks. However, the total mechanical joint work (WTotal), parameter best related to the vertical displacement of the body mass center during vertical jumping, has not yet been studied. The aim of this research was to compare asymmetries between ACL-R subjects and healthy matched subjects, through the analysis of the kinematics and kinetics during a single-leg squat jump. Asymmetries are defined by the Limb Symmetry Index (LSI). A greater LSI was observed for WTotal in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. There was no difference in LSI for knee joint work between the two groups, while the LSI for hip and ankle joint work was significantly larger in the ACL-R group. This was explained by greater LSI for the hip and ankle joint range of motion in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. After ACL-R, patients exhibited greater asymmetries than healthy subjects during single-leg squat jump. Physiotherapists should focus on quality execution of multi-joint movement, especially on hip and ankle joints range of motion in order to reduce asymmetries and to improve vertical jumping performance.

AB  - Abstract? 1 The macroscopic and histological examination of the genital tracts of 179 bitches form the basis of this paper. 2 Group I comprised 24 bitches with a history of false pregnancy. (a).? Sub-group 1A was composed of 6 genital tracts removed at the height of clinical signs. The ovaries contained large corpora lutea. The uteri were increased in length and diameter. The endometrium was hyperplastic, particularly in the placenta-like zones. (b).? Sub-group IB was composed of 10 genital tracts removed after the subsidence of clinical signs. The ovaries contained regressing corpora lutea and many Graafian follicles, some of which showed sinusoidal thecal capillaries. The uteri were slightly increased in length and diameter with slight endomctrial hyperplasia and intense congestion. No placenta-like bands were observed. (c).? Sub-group 1C was composed of 8 genital tracts removed after the subsidence of clinical signs. Unlike sub-group IB the ovaries only contained regressing corpora lutea. The uteri in 4 cases showed a fibrotic endometrium with marked vascular hyperplasia and perivascular fibrosis. In 3 cases they showed uterine atrophy and in one case metoestral changes. No placenta-like bands were observed. (3.).? Group II comprised 155 genital tracts removed from bitches with a clinical diagnosis of Hormonal Pyometra. Twenty of these cases had a history of false pregnancy. The changes in these 20 uteri were similar to those found in the remaining 135 cases of Hormonal Pyometra without a history of false pregnancy. The differences between the cases of hormonal pyometra and uncomplicated false pregnancy (sub-group 1A) are detailed. (4.).? The aetiology of false pregnancy is discussed and it is suggested that there is a basic hyper-function of the anterior pituitary which is responsible for the persistence of the corpus luteum. The continued secretion of progesterone is responsible for the changes that occur in the uterus in false pregnancy. Résumé? 1 L'examen macroscopique et histologique de l'appareil génital de 179 chiennes, forme la base de ce rapport. 2 Le groupe 1 comprenait 24 chiennes avec des antécédents de fausse grossesse. (a)? Le sous-groupe IA était composé de 6 appareils génitaux enlevés à l'apogée de signes cliniques. Les ovaires contenaient des larges corps jaunes. Les utérus étaient augmentéd en longeur et diamètre. L'endomfètre était hyperplastique, particulièrement dans les zones ayant l'aspect de placenta. (b)? Le sous-groupe 1B était composé de 10 appareils génitaux enlevés après l'apaisement de signes cliniques. Les ovaires contenaient des corps jaunes en voie de règression et des nombreux follicules de Graaf, quelques-uns ayant des capillaires thécaux d'aspect sinusoidal. Les utérus étaient modérément augmentés en longeur et diamètre avec légère hyperplasie endométriale et congestion intense. Pas de présence de bandeaux ayant l'aspect de placenta. (c)? Le sous-groupe IC était composé de 8 appareils génitaux enlevés après l'apaisement de signes cliniques. En contraste avec le sous-group 1B, les ovaires contenaient seulement du corps jaune en voie de régression. Dans 4 cas les utérus montraient un endomètre fibreux avec hyperplasie vasculairc marquée et fibrose perivasculaire. Dan 3 cas ils montraient une atrophie utérine et dans un cas de altérations metoestrales. Pas de présence de bandeaux ayant l'aspect de placenta. 3 Le 2me groupe comprenait 155 appareils génitaux enlevés de chiennes, avec un diagnostique clinique de pyométrie hormonale. Vingt de ces cas avaient de antécédents de fausse grossesse. Les altérations dans ces 20 utérus étaient similaires à celles trouvées dans le groupe de 135 cas de pyométrie hormonale, mais sans antécédents de fausse grossesse. Les différences entre les cas de pyométrie hormonale et de fausse grossesse (le sous-groupe IA) sont décrites. 4 L'étiologie de la fausse grossesse est discutée et il est suggére qu'il s'agit d'une hyperfonction basique de la glande pituitaire antérieure qui est responsable pour la pérsistance du corps jaune. La sécrétion continuelle de progestérone est responsable pour les changements qui se produisent dans l'utérus dans la fausse grossesse. Zusammenfassung? 1 Die makroskopische und histologische Untersuchung des Genital-traktes von 179 Huendinnen sind der Gegenstand dieser Arbiet. 2 Gruppe I unfasste 24 Huendinnen mit einer Anamnese von Pseudo-Schwangerschaft. (a).? Die Untergruppe IA bestand aus 6 Genitaltrakten, die auf der Hoehe der klinischen Symptome enfernt worden waren. Die Ovarien enthielten grosse Corpora lutea. Die Uteri waren der Laenge nach und im Durchmesser vergroessert. Das Endometrium war hyper-plastisch, besonders in den Plazenta-aehnlichen Zonen. (b).? Die Untergruppe 1B bestand aus 10 Genitaltrakten, die nach dem Abklingen der klinischen Symptome entfernt worden waren. Die Ovarien enthielten Corpora lutea in der Rueckbildung und viele Graafsche Follikel, von denen einige Sinus-artige scheidenartige Kapillaren zeigten. Die Uteri waren der Laenge nach und im Durchmesser leicht vergroessert mit leichter Hyperplasie des Endometriums und intensiver Stauung. Keine Plazenta-aehnliche Streifen waren ersichtlich. (c).? Die Untergruppe IC bestand aus 8 Genitaltrakten, die nach dem Abklingen der klinischen Symptome entfernt worden waren. Im Gegensatz zu der Untergruppe 1B enthielten die Ovarien nur Corpora lutea in der Rueckbildung. In 4 Faelzen zeigten die Uteri ein fibrotisches Endometrium mit deutlicher vaskulaerer Hyperplasie und perivaskulaerer Fibrose. In 3 Faellen bestand Uterus-Atrophie und in einem Falle metoestrale Veraenderung. Keine Plazenta-aehnliche Streifen waren ersichtlich. 3 Gruppe 2 umfasste 155 Genitaltrakte, die von Huendinnen mit einer klinischen Diagnose von hormonalem Pyometrium entfernt worden waren. In 20 Faellen war eine Anamnese von Pscudo-Schwangerschaft. Die Veraenderungen in diesen 20 Uteri waren aehnlich wie die anderen in den uebrigen 135 Faellen von hormonalem Pyometrium ohne eine Anamnese von Pseudo-Schwangerschaft. Die Unterschiede zwischen den Faellen von hormonalem Pyometrium und unkomplizierter Pseudo-Schwangerschaft (Untergruppe 1A) werden beschrieben. 4 Die Aetiologie der Pseudo-Schwangerschaft wird eroertert; es wird angenommen, dass eine basische Ueberfunktion des Hypopysenvorderlappens vorliegt, die fuer das Fortbestehen des Corpus luteum verantwortlich ist. Die anhaltende Sekretion von Progesteron ist verantwortlich fuer die Veraenderungen, die im Uterus bei Pseudo-Schwangerschaft auftreten.

AB  - Summary? The advent of selective internal urethrotomy under direct vision has enabled precision endoscopic surgery to be undertaken on a wide range of urethral strictures. A multi-centre survey of 197 cases involving 322 urethrotomy procedures from 5 urological departments in England is reported. The overall results after a follow-up of up to 4 years suggest that there is no indication for further procedures currently existing in 160 (81%) of those cases subjected to selective internal urethrotomy. The additional injection of triamcinalone acetate into the strictured area prior to urethrotomy is recommended in resistant cases The procedure of selective internal urethrotomy is, in our opinion, the best primary method for the treatment of urethral stricture, and it is hoped this will reduce the indications for anastomotic or substitution urethroplasty.

AB  - Objective Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is the most commonly employed surgical technique for treating cervical spondylosis. Although autologous bone grafts are considered the gold standard in achieving fusion, associated short- and long-term morbidities have led to a search for alternative materials. These have included carbon-fiber, titanium alloy (Ti) and ceramic and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) based implants. Recent attempts to optimize cage implants through using composite designs have combined Ti and PEEK. However, there are few published reports on the clinical and radiological outcomes of commercially available composite cages. Our study aimed to provide and evaluate initial outcomes of a composite Ti/PEEK cage. Methods In this prospective single senior surgeon cohort study, 31 consecutive patients underwent a modified Smith?Robinson technique under general anesthesia and relevant data were collected. The study patients were aged between 18 and 75 years and underwent surgery from November 2013 to May 2014. Indications for surgery included traumatic and degenerative cervical disease that was unsuitable for or unresponsive to conservative management. All cages were between 5 and 8 mm and packed with super critical fluid sterilized allograft and bone marrow aspirate before insertion. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months. Fusion was assessed using fine cut CT and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Clinical outcomes were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale, Neck Oswestry Disability Index and Patient's Satisfaction Index. Results Six of the original cohort were unavailable for adequate follow-up. The remaining 25 patients (17 men, 8 women; 33 operative levels) were observed for a mean of 14.6 months (range, 12?16 months). All operation levels were between C4 and C7. Single-level operations were performed in 19 patients and additional plating in 14 patients. A fusion rate of 96% was achieved. Patients in both plated and non-plated groups experienced statistically significant improvements; good to excellent outcomes being seen in 92% of patients. There was one complication, namely recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, which had partially resolved at 6 months follow-up. Conclusion The present study shows that enhancement of PEEK cages with Ti endplates is a safe and effective treatment with the potential for early osseointegration and early radiological evidence of fusion.

AB  - Objectives: To retrospectively review the first treatment response of dogs with mycotic rhinosinusitis to commonly utilised treatment techniques. Methods: Medical records of dogs treated for mycotic rhinosinusitis were obtained retrospectively via a manual review of the clinical databases of six veterinary referral centres for the period of January 1998 to June 2008, and first treatment outcome was evaluated. Historical and clinicopathological findings were also reviewed to evaluate their impact on treatment success or failure. Results: There was no significant difference in first treatment outcome between treatment groups (P=0·21). When all topical treatments were considered together (n=85), 39 dogs (45·8%) had a successful first treatment. Initial treatment success was associated with a younger age (56·3 versus 75·8 months; P=0·02) and was 2·7 times more likely in dogs with unilateral disease, although this was not significant (P=0·07). Adjunctive therapy with systemic antifungal agents was associated with treatment failure (PÄ0·01). Fifty-nine dogs (69·4%) responded successfully following multiple treatments. Clinical Significance: Treatment of mycotic rhinosinusitis remains challenging, and multiple treatments are frequently required for adequate treatment. Reasons for first treatment failure are likely multifactorial in origin, making it difficult to predict those dogs that are likely to have a superior prognosis, regardless of the treatment type used.
