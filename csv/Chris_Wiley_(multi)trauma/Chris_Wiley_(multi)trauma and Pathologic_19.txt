AB  - Hypertrophic scarring is a pathological process characterized by a fibroblastic hyperproliferation and by an excess of deposition of extracellular matrix components. Hypothesis of abnormalities in epidermal-dermal cross talk has been laid down to explain this pathology. To check this affirmation, we used a tissue-engineered model of self-assembly reconstructed skin in order to mimic interactions between dermal and epidermal cells in normal or pathological skin. We performed those skin equivalents with three dermal cell types : normal wound (Wmyo) or hypertrophic wound (Hmyo) myofibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts (Fb). Epidermis was reconstructed with normal skin keratinocytes (NK), hypertrophic scars keratinocytes (HK), or without any keratinocytes. In the absence of epidermis, Hmyo formed a thicker dermis than Wmyo. When seeded with NK, the dermal thickness of Hmyo and Fb dermis was significantly reduced while that of Wmyo was increased. However, the presence of HK always induced thicker dermis formation than observed with NK. HK also increase the production of extracellular matrix and reduce its degradation in comparison with NK. In addition, HK have more influence on dermal cells proliferation than NK. In conclusion, HK may play a more important role on fibrosis development than NK. The keratinocytes have distinct secretory patterns depending on their skin source. Wmyo and Hmyo do not react the same way to the presence of keratinocytes. These observations strongly suggest that HK have a more important role on pathological fibrosis development by influencing dermal cells behavior. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in adult patients with traumatic brain injury is not fully understood. The historical use of therapeutic hypothermia at extreme temperatures was associated with severe complications and led to it being discredited. Positive results from animal studies using milder temperatures led to renewed interest. However, recent studies have not convincingly demonstrated the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia in practice. Aim This review aims to answer the question: in adults with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), does the use of therapeutic hypothermia compared with normothermia affect neurological outcome? Design Systematic review. Method Four major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The studies were appraised using a systematic approach, and four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. Results A total of eight peer-reviewed studies were found, and the results show there is some evidence that therapeutic hypothermia may be effective in improving neurological outcome in adult patients with traumatic brain injury. However, the majority of the trials report conflicting results. Therapeutic hypothermia is reported to be effective at lowering intracranial pressure; however, its efficacy in improving neurological outcome is not fully demonstrated. This review suggests that therapeutic hypothermia had increased benefits in patients with haematoma-type injuries as opposed to those with diffuse injury and contusions. It also suggests that cooling should recommence if rebound intracranial hypertension is observed. Conclusion Although the data indicates a trend towards better neurological outcome and reduced mortality rates, higher quality multi-centred randomized controlled trials are required before therapeutic hypothermia is implemented as a standard adjuvant therapy for treating traumatic brain injury. Relevance to clinical practice Therapeutic hypothermia can have a positive impact on patient outcome, but more research is required.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and other cognitive functions in the elderly. The social and financial impacts of AD are overwhelming and are escalating exponentially as a result of population aging. Therefore, identifying AD-related risk factors and the development of more efficacious therapeutic approaches are critical to cure this neurological disorder. Current epidemiological evidence indicates that life experiences, including chronic stress, are a risk for AD. However, it is unknown if short-term stress, lasting for hours, influences the onset or progression of AD. Here, we determined the effect of short-term, multi-modal ?modern life-like? stress on AD pathogenesis and synaptic plasticity in mice bearing three AD mutations (the 3xTg-AD mouse model). We found that combined emotional and physical stress lasting 5 h severely impaired memory in wild-type mice and tended to impact it in already low-performing 3xTg-AD mice. This stress reduced the number of synapse-bearing dendritic spines in 3xTg-AD mice and increased A? levels by augmenting A?PP processing. Thus, short-term stress simulating modern-life conditions may exacerbate cognitive deficits in preclinical AD by accelerating amyloid pathology and reducing synapse numbers.

AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relationship between mother and infant within multiproblem, so-called ?hard to reach? families. In an effort to understand factors contributing to problems in caring for the young children of these parents, a group of 47 families was recruited for study by the Clinical Infant Development Program of the National Institute of Mental Health. Serious social pathology was found within 75 percent of families. The lives of mothers in these families was marked by long term disruptions: 64 percent were from families characterized by recurring poverty and psychiatric illness, and 69 percent reported disruptions in parental care prior to age twelve, while more than two-thirds reported a history of being physically and/or sexually abused as children. More than 75 percent of this group of women presently showed psychiatric distress. Many of these women have difficulty in providing adequately for their young children and require innovative intervention programs in order to facilitate parenting.

Outcome A 70-year-old male showed infarctions in the cerebellum bilaterally and the right hypothalamus on the sixth day after an injury with no fracture of the cervical spine, and bilateral dissection of the vertebral arteries was diagnosed. A 74-year-old male showed infarctions in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery 2 days after injury with fractures of the cervical spine (C2 and C3) and was diagnosed as having artery-to-artery embolism based on dissection of the right vertebral artery. Conclusion Head and neck injury is a very common presentation in the emergency department. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography is an effective screening imaging method for vertebral artery dissection that should be carried out on arrival in every patient with fracture of the cervical spine, and even considered in doubtful cases with no fracture.

AB  - Abstract??? Background:? Apical barrier formation and root strengthening procedures have been extensively described in the literature. This systematic review attempts to establish where the effects of interventions using multi-visit apexification, single visit apical plug techniques and root strengthening procedures are consistent and where they may vary significantly. Objectives:? To evaluate the relative effectiveness of apexification and apical plug techniques as well as root strengthening procedures for treating traumatized necrotic immature permanent anterior teeth through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Reported immediate and/or long-term adverse events and effects of the materials and techniques are also evaluated. Search strategy & selection criteria:? Structured electronic and hand search was performed with no restriction on the language of publication. Only randomized controlled trials comparing different apical barrier formation techniques and root strengthening procedures in traumatized necrotic immature anterior teeth were assessed. Results:? Two hundred studies were identified but only two were suitable for inclusion. Included studies investigated multi-visit apexification techniques using calcium hydroxide and tricalcium phosphate. There were no eligible studies investigating root strengthening procedures or any other intervention for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth. No reliable information was available on long-term adverse effects of the reported interventions or cost implications. Conclusions:? Based on two included studies, there is weak evidence supporting the use of either calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth employing multi-visit apexification techniques. The evidence is insufficient to provide guidelines for practice. There was no reliable evidence on adverse events or long-term effects after the use of calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate justifying caution in their use in apical barrier formation techniques.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bioarchaeologists have long noted two unusual trends in the dentitions of prehistoric Native Californian populations: high rates of wear and low prevalence of caries. The Central California site of CA-CCO-548 offers a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between oral pathology and extreme dental wear in a large (n?=?480), ancient (4,300?3,100 BP), and temporally well-defined population sample. This study specifically examines three interrelated processes of the oral cavity in this population: dental wear, dental caries, and periodontal disease. The results show high levels of dental wear (average of 6.1, Smith system), low frequencies of carious lesions (2.5%), low frequencies of periodontal disease (17.8%), and high frequencies of periapical abscesses (10.7%). The pathological processes examined here have complicated multifactorial etiologies. However, they all share the common primary etiological agents of facultative pathogenic bacteria proliferation in the oral biofilm. Integration of the current etiological explanations for infections of the oral cavity, information from the ethnographic record pertaining to subsistence and activity patterns in Native Californian populations, and statistical analysis of specific disease and wear patterns leads to a novel explanation for the observed pattern of oral pathology in this population sample. Specifically, the introduction of antibacterial compounds through dietary items and non-alimentary tooth use is suggested as the most likely explanation for the unusually low prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma can result in tooth loss despite best efforts at retaining and maintaining compromised teeth (Dent Traumatol, 24, 2008, 379). Upper anterior teeth are more likely to suffer from trauma, and their loss can result in significant aesthetic and functional problems that can be difficult to manage (Endod Dent Traumatol, 9, 1993, 61; Int Dent J 59, 2009, 127). Indeed, teeth of poor prognosis may not only present with compromised structure but trauma may also result in damage to the support tissues. Injury to the periodontium and alveolus can have repercussions on subsequent restorative procedures (Fig. 19). Where teeth are identified as having a hopeless prognosis either soon after the incident or at delayed presentation; planning for eventual tooth loss and replacement can begin at the early stages. With advances in both adhesive and osseointegration technologies, there are now a variety of options for the restoration of edentate spaces subsequent to dental trauma. This review aims to identify key challenges in the provision of tooth replacement in the traumatized dentition and outline contemporary methods in treatment delivery.

AB  - Objective The current study investigated the role of cognitive, affective, and behavioural information in the prediction of overall attitudes towards asylum seekers. Method A sample of 98 Australian adults participated in an online self-report questionnaire where participants generated their cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors towards asylum seekers and then rated those factors on a continuum from ?positive? to ?negative?. Results Multiple regression analysis confirmed the primary role of cognitive, then affective, factors in predicting attitudes towards asylum seekers. Cognitive information accounted for a moderate, significant 31.92% of the variance in overall attitudes towards asylum seekers. The unique variance contributed by affective information accounted for a small but significant 3.46% of the variance in overall attitudes; the unique variance contributed by behavioural information was not significant. Conclusions The results provide a holistic theoretical basis for the assertion that community attitudes towards asylum seekers are based primarily on cognitive evaluations of the minority group. These findings have implications for changing community attitudes towards people seeking asylum in Australia.

AB  - Systemic adenosine has been shown in earlier case reports and a small placebo-controlled study to reducepathological sensory dysfunction such as tactile allodynia in neuropathic pain. To evaluate this further, the effects of systemic adenosine infusion (50 ?g/kg/min for 60 min) on tactile sensory dysfunction and pain was evaluated in 26 patients suffering peripheral neuropathic pain characterized by dynamic tactile allodynia. A randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled technique was used in this multi-centre study. Psychophysical methods were used to evaluate sensory dysfunction and spontaneous pain. The area of dynamic tactile allodynia was significantly reduced by adenosine compared with placebo (p=0.043), but spon-taneous pain and tactile pain threshold were not significantly improved compared with the effects of placebo treatment. As a secondary outcome, a higher incidence of positive subjective effects on the clinical pain condi-tion, in a few cases with long duration (several months), following adenosine treatment was found when theglobal effect of respective treatment was assessed (p=0.028). The results demonstrate involvement of adenosine receptor-sensitive pain mechanisms in some aspects of the sensory dysfunction often found in neuropathic pain.

AB  - Background Hospital-acquired anemia is commonly described in people but limited information currently is available regarding its prevalence in animals. Hypothesis/objectives Assess the prevalence of hospital-acquired anemia in hospitalized critically ill dogs and cats, and examine its relationship with phlebotomy practices, transfusion administration, and survival to discharge. Animals Eight hundred and fifty-one client-owned animals (688 dogs and 163 cats). Methods A multicenter, observational study was conducted in which packed cell volume (PCV) was recorded at the time of admission and on subsequent hospitalization days. Signalment, number of blood samples obtained, underlying disease, whether or not blood products were administered, duration of hospitalization, and survival to discharge were recorded. Results Admission anemia prevalence was 32%, with overall prevalence during the hospitalization period of 56%. The last recorded PCV was significantly lower than the admission PCV for both dogs (admission PCV, 42% [range, 6?67%]; last recorded PCV, 34% [range, 4?64%], P < .0001) and cats (admission PCV, 31% [range, 6?55%]; last recorded PCV, 26% [range, 10?46%], P < .0001). Patients that developed anemia had significantly more blood samples obtained (nonanemic, 5 blood samples [range, 2?54]; anemic, 7 blood samples [range, 2?49], P < .0001). Hospitalized cats were significantly more likely to develop anemia compared to dogs (P < .0001), but anemic dogs were significantly less likely to survive to discharge (P = .0001). Surgical patients were at higher risk of developing hospital-acquired anemia compared to medical patients (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.4?0.9; P = .01). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Hospital-acquired anemia occurred frequently, especially in surgical patients. Additional studies focused on the direct effect of phlebotomy practices on the likelihood of anemia development in hospitalized animals are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Pareiasaurs were a group of herbivorous reptiles that lived during the middle to late Permian (265?252 Ma). About 20 species are currently recognized from a fossil record spanning Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. All pareiasaurs have a peculiar vertebral anatomy characterized by ?swollen? neural arches. Some species grew to large body size (e.g., 600 kg) and evolved up to five sacral vertebrae, but the detailed anatomy of the sacral region is poorly documented. Vertebral elements referable to the derived pareiasaur subclade Velosauria were recently recovered from the upper Madumabisa Mudstone Formation (Luangwa Basin) of Zambia and are described here. The specimen exhibits an abnormal morphology: the neural arches of the second, third, and fourth sacral vertebrae share a single, elongate centrum that is fused anteriorly with a ?normal? first sacral vertebra, and articulates posteriorly with a slightly disarticulated first caudal vertebra. We suggest two distinct pathologies are responsible for this morphology: (1) spondyloarthropathy (re-ossified intervertebral joint) and (2) congenital block vertebra. The processes of development of neural arches and centra, while evolutionarily independent in origin, have been found to be conserved in all amniotes. While paleopathological morphologies can provide insight into environmental and disease-based etiologies, pathological congenital malformations are particularly rare in fossil record and have the potential to be informative for understanding the evolution of vertebral development. The anatomy described here sheds light on pareiasaurian sacral morphology and provides insight into the pathology in one of the earliest clades of large-bodied reptiles near the base of the amniote tree.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the hypothesis that disordered eating in second- and third-generation women would be related to their levels of Holocaust exposure and family dysfunction. Method One hundred eight mother-daughter dyads were ascertained through the daughters, all Israeli college students 18--35 years of age. Mothers and daughters assessed themselves on family function, Holocaust exposure and disordered eating. Results The disordered eating of women of the third generation was partially predicted by their mothers' disordered eating and by their mothers' Holocaust exposure. The second generation reported more maternal over-protection and emotional over-involvement than did the third generation. Contrary to expectation, the third-generation women were more Holocaust exposed than were the second generation. Discussion The nature of Holocaust exposure for second and third generations needs further study and clarification in relation to disordered eating. There is considerable disparity between the results of clinical and qualitative studies which tend to find a strong relationship between Holocaust exposure and psychopathology, and population-based quantitative studies which tend to find a much weaker relationship.
