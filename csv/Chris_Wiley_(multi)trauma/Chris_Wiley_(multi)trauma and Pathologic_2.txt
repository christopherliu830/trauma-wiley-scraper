AB  - Abstract??? Traumatized teeth present a clinical challenge with regard to their diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis. Recent developments in imaging systems have enabled clinicians to visualize structural changes effectively. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cone beam computed tomography are among the most commonly used systems for dental and maxillofacial surgery. The purpose of this review is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the clinical application for dento-alveolar trauma. Three clinical cases are described to illustrate the potential use of the NewTom 3G for diagnosis and treatment plan of dento-alveolar traumatic injuries.

AB  - Clinicians are charged with being diligent in gaining competency in the latest trauma-informed interventions when working with relational trauma. This may invest therapists with an overresponsibility that is not only overwhelming and unrealistic, but serves to reduce autonomous functioning in family members. Therefore, clinicians need to become clear about what they are responsible for and what they are not, particularly when family members present as irresponsible or too anxious to think and act more effectively. Using a case vignette, this paper discusses how a clinician's focus on increasing their differentiation of self, a concept embeded in Bowen family systems theory, protects against vicarious traumatisation, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout whilst contributing to more autonomous functioning and better wellbeing outcomes for both clinicians and clients alike.

AB  - Abstract Background Trauma and its sequelae is recognised as a major morbidity factor in people with intellectual disabilities, however, a lack of inquiry into how health care professionals address trauma in this adult population exists. Aims To explore specialist intellectual disability practitioners perspectives on current health provision and developments to address trauma. Methods Twenty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with practitioners across 6 health service areas in the UK. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings Seven central themes emerged: (a) unmasked trauma; (b) trauma informed care; (c) person-centred care and support; (d) multi-disciplinary working; (e) reasonable adjustments; (f) barriers to treatment and (g) awareness, training and education. Conclusion Trauma-informed care and multi-disciplinary working are essential components for future service development. Advances in the evidence-base for effective psychological interventions for PTSD and training and education of health care staff are needed in order to improve service provision amongst this population.

AB  - Objective To describe the technique and findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? protocol in dogs suffering from trauma. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Objective To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma. Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.

AB  - As with all areas of medicine, high-quality clinical research is essential to improving the care of trauma patients. This research is crucial in developing evidence-based treatments that decrease cost, decrease morbidity, and improve mortality. Trauma continues to extract a significant toll on society and is the single largest cause of years of life lost in the United States. The need to conduct high-quality clinical research in trauma is not disputed. However, significant challenges and barriers unique to the field of trauma make performing this research more difficult. It is critical to be aware of these challenges and barriers to performing clinical research involving trauma patients so these challenges can be accounted for and solutions implemented to minimize their impact on research. This review will focus on the barriers and challenges that are encountered while performing clinical research in trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Audit is the evaluation of patient care. The care of the injured patient commences at the accident scene and involves prehospital triage and management, emergency hospital assessment and resuscitation, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, operative surgery, intensive care unit management, acute hospital care and rehabilitation. Audit assesses the delivery of trauma care and clinical management and through identification of inadequacies facilitates the introduction of appropriate improvements. Both the American National Academy of Sciences?National Research Council and the Australian National Health & Medical Research Council have recommended the establishment of an audit process to evaluate the quality of trauma management and to obtain quality assurance. They have advised that this process would be assisted by the development of regional trauma registries and a uniform approach to the grading of injuries. Reduction in the preventable death rate, frequency of complications and duration of hospitalization has followed audits as a result of changes in the organization and quality of trauma care. In the United States, for example, the preventable death rate after injury was reduced from 35 to 15% in Orange County, California and from 14 to 3% in San Diego County, California. Studies from Great Britain, The Netherlands, Canada, Australia and elsewhere have further supported the view that trauma audit modifies practice leading to reductions in mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Summary Comorbidity of trauma and PTSD with addictive disorders is common in adolescents. The interrelationship between the two conditions is complex with addictive behaviors following the trauma, as well as preceding it. While there are established treatments for each of the conditions separately, few treatments addressing the comorbidity have been developed and tested. Little is known about the impact of the comorbid addictive disorders and trauma-related disorders on the adolescent developmental trajectory, the ability of the adolescents to acquire crucial psychosocial skills in the face of these twin disorders. In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated.

AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives Large scale data on the treatment of pathologic proximal femur fractures (PPFFs) are lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in patient demographics, complication rates, and relative utilization rates of various techniques associated with PPFFs. Methods The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for PPFFs from 2009 to 2017. Patient demographics, 30-day complications, and utilization rates were recorded. Trends in these variables were determined over the study period. Results Most patient demographics did not change during the study period. There were no trends toward decreasing rates of major complications (P?=?.82), reoperations (P?=?.65), non-home discharges (P?=?.17), readmissions (P?=?.07), or deaths (P?=?.75); transfusion rates significantly decreased (P?<?.001). Rates of hemiarthroplasty decreased (P?=?.03) and rates of intramedullary nailing increased (P?=?.001). Discussion Despite advances in cancer therapeutics, the average PPFF patient has not significantly changed over the past decade. Similarly, most short-term outcomes after PPFF surgery have not improved, demonstrating a need for improved perioperative protocols. Finally, rates of IMN fixation are increasing while rates of HA are falling at NSQIP hospitals. Given that orthopedic oncologists favor endoprosthetic reconstruction in most cases, there may be a need for increased communication between orthopedic oncologists and other members of the orthopedic community treating PPFFs.

AB  - Australia?s population is ageing. Statistics predict that by the year 2021, 17.8% of our population will be over the age of 65 years.1 These statistics are reflected in most Western nations. The elderly represent an increasing proportion of emergency department patients. They are generally more acute on presentation, they get admitted more frequently, and account for an increasing proportion of admissions to intensive care units.2 The elderly trauma patient will increasingly consume more resources than patients from any other age group. There are significant differences in physiology and response to trauma between the elderly patient and the young. Airway compromises, a decrease in lung compliance, a change in cardiovascular haemostasis and the prevalence of pre-existing disease all contribute to increase morbidity and mortality in a patient with an already limited physiological reserve. Many studies demonstrate an increased mortality in hospitalized elderly trauma patients. For those who die from traumatic insult, death is mainly due to multi- organ system failure.3 The long-term functional outcome of the elderly trauma patient has been investigated by a number of authors. One study showed that only 8% of survivors returned to independent living 1 year post-polytrauma.4 Another more encouraging study showed that 89% of survivors of blunt multiple trauma after 38 months were independent and living at home.5 Ethical issues have been raised regarding the appropriateness of care for the severely injured elderly patient given today?s ever-shrinking hospital finances and bed shortages. Today?s environment is very challenging as frequently, the clinician is forced to make an economic decision on who will take the last critical care bed, which is a far from optimal situation.
