AB  - Abstract Objective To test the hypothesis that disordered eating in second- and third-generation women would be related to their levels of Holocaust exposure and family dysfunction. Method One hundred eight mother-daughter dyads were ascertained through the daughters, all Israeli college students 18--35 years of age. Mothers and daughters assessed themselves on family function, Holocaust exposure and disordered eating. Results The disordered eating of women of the third generation was partially predicted by their mothers' disordered eating and by their mothers' Holocaust exposure. The second generation reported more maternal over-protection and emotional over-involvement than did the third generation. Contrary to expectation, the third-generation women were more Holocaust exposed than were the second generation. Discussion The nature of Holocaust exposure for second and third generations needs further study and clarification in relation to disordered eating. There is considerable disparity between the results of clinical and qualitative studies which tend to find a strong relationship between Holocaust exposure and psychopathology, and population-based quantitative studies which tend to find a much weaker relationship.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the recently developed Eye Movement Desensitization (EMD) procedure on traumatic memory symptomatology. Twenty-two subjects suffering from symptoms related to traumatic memories were used in the study. All had been victims of traumatic incidents concerning the Vietnam War, childhood sexual molestation, sexual or physical assault, or emotional abuse. Memories of the traumatic incident were pivotal to the presenting complaints which included intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, and relationship problems. Dependent variables were (1) anxiety level, (2) validity of a positive self-statement/assessment of the traumatic incident, and (3) presenting complaints. These measures were obtained at the initial session and at 1- and 3-month follow-up sessions. The results of the study indicated that a single session of the EMD procedure successfully desensitized the subjects' traumatic memories and dramatically altered their cognitive assessments of the situation, effects that were maintained through the 3-month follow-up check. This therapeutic benefit was accompanied by behavioral shifts which included the alleviation of the subjects' primary presenting complaints.

AB  - Aims To verify the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravesical administration of 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride compared to its oral administration for treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multi-center trial in 35 adult patients. Methods NDO was confirmed within the previous 24 months by urodynamic studies (UDS). Group 1 (n?=?18) received 10?ml 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride intravesically three times per day and group 2 (n?=?17) 5?mg oxybutynin hydrochloride orally three times per day for a period of 28 days. Primary efficacy criterion was the change in the maximum bladder capacity between the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks as assessed by UDS. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were collected and an evaluation of anticholinergic effects was conducted. Results The increase in maximum bladder capacity was 117?ml with intravesical application (P?=?0.0002) versus 18?ml with the oral application (P?=?0.51). The difference was statistically significant (P?=?0.0086). ADR were reported by 10 (55.6%) of patients with intravesical administration, and by 14 (82.4%) of patients with oral administration. Significant differences in favor of the intravesical application were observed in ADR affecting vision (1/10 vs. 9/14), gastrointestinal tract (8/10 vs. 14/14), nervous system (2/10 vs. 8/14), and skin and subcutis (1/10 vs. 6/14). No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Conclusions This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of intravesical 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride in the treatment of NDO with respect to the increase in maximum bladder capacity. Neurourol.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) reconstruction at two different slice thicknesses (1?mm, ?high resolution? vs. 5?mm, ?routine?) with respect to the detection of blebs and bullae (BBs) in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

Abstract:? Introduction:? Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand IgG fusion protein, rPSGL-Ig (YSPSL), a fusion protein of human P-selectin ligand and IgG1-Fc, blocks leukocyte adhesion and protects against ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in animal models. Patients and Methods:? This randomized 15-center, double-blind, 59-patient Ph2a study assessed YSPSL?s safety in recipients of deceased-donor kidney allografts and its potential efficacy in improving early graft function. Two doses and two dosing modalities were evaluated. Results:? No drug-specific toxicities or increased adverse event rates were noted. Two YSPSL-treated patients died of causes determined as unrelated to study drug. YSPSL did not reduce the incidence of dialysis within the first week post-transplant (41% in treated vs. 20% in placebo patients). Renal function endpoints scored at post-operative days 1 & 2 were also not impacted by YSPSL. However, at day 5, the fraction of patients with serum creatinine above 6?mg/dL was lower in the YSPSL vs. placebo group (26% vs. 55%, p?=?0.043). Large variations in the dialysis-delayed graft function (DGF) rates were observed between centers, independently of treatment assignment, indicating subjectivity of this endpoint. Conclusion:? In this first Ph2a study in kidney transplantation, YSPSL was safe but did not impact the dialysis-DGF rate. Further studies with more objective efficacy endpoints are required to define the impact of YSPSL on early renal allograft function.

AB  - Families of gender nonconforming children need to negotiate the interactions between two gender systems: a rigid gender binary imported from familial, social, and cultural experiences and a fluid gender spectrum articulated by their child. This article reviews parental reactions to nonconforming gender developments and poses that the parental mandates of protection and acceptance are problematized by the difference of gender norms between the child and the family, as well as the child and the environment. Through multiple therapeutic modalities?parental coaching and education, parent support group, and child and family therapy?the author illustrates interventions supporting both parents and prepubescent children in their negotiation of safety, connection, and fluidity. Case vignettes illustrate the method in action.

AB  - Abstract Whilst the importance of mutations in a wide range of keratins in skin fragility disorders is now well established, there is much less evidence for simple epithelial keratin involvement in disease. Some simple epithelial keratin mutations have been reported in liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis patients, and recently mutations in the simple epithelial keratin K8 were identified in a group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis). In comparison with the mutations seen in epidermal keratins, these simple epithelial mutations would be predicted to have mild consequences, although analysis shows that they do have a distinct effect. This review article discusses the evidence that these mutations are a predisposing factor for inflammatory bowel disease. Copyright ? 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - Aims The SUCCESS trial is a phase III study of the Vesair? balloon in the United States for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The purpose of this manuscript is to present the 3 month primary efficacy and tolerability outcome data. Methods The SUCCESS trial is a multi-center, prospective, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. Subjects were randomized on a 2.33:1 basis to either Vesair balloon placement or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of both a >50% reduction from baseline on 1?h provocative pad weight test and a ≥10-point improvement in symptoms on the Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) questionnaire assessed at the 3 month study visit. Results A total of 221 subjects were randomized, including 157 treatment arm subjects and 64 controls. The 3 month composite primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 42.1% of treatment group subjects compared with 28.1% of controls on intention-to-treat analysis (p?=?0.046). Treatment arm subjects were significantly more likely to report at least a 50% reduction in incontinence frequency on 7-day voiding diary (55.2% vs 32.3%, P?=?0.002, ITT) and more commonly reported their incontinence was improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Incontinence (PGI-I) at 3 months compared with controls (58.0% vs 37.7%, P?=?0.007, ITT). No device- or procedure-related serious adverse events nor unanticipated adverse events were reported and no cases of urinary retention were observed. All adverse events fully resolved following balloon removal. Conclusions In this phase three trial, the Vesair intravesical balloon achieved 3 month primary and secondary endpoints both objectively and subjectively.

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

AB  - Abstract PSD-95 inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in stroke, but have only to a very limited extent been evaluated in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that has pathophysiological mechanisms in common with stroke. The aims of the current study were to assess the effects of a novel dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, UCCB01-147, on histopathology and long-term cognitive outcome after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rats. As excitotoxic cell death is thought to be a prominent part of the pathophysiology of TBI, we also investigated the neuroprotective effects of UCCB01-147 and related compounds on NMDA-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons. Anesthetized rats were given a CCI or sham injury, and were randomized to receive an injection of either UCCB01-147 (10 mg/kg), the non-competitive NMDAR-receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline immediately after injury. At 2 and 4 weeks post-trauma, spatial learning and memory were assessed in a water maze, and at 3 months, brains were removed for estimation of lesion volumes. Overall, neither treatment with UCCB01-147 nor MK-801 resulted in significant improvements of cognition and histopathology after CCI. Although MK-801 provided robust neuroprotection against NMDA-induced toxicity in cultured cortical neurons, UCCB01-147 failed to reduce cell death and became neurotoxic at high doses. The data suggest potential differential effects of PSD-95 inhibition in stroke and TBI that should be investigated further in future studies taking important experimental factors such as timing of treatment, dosage, and anesthesia into consideration.

AB  - Background Porcine ulcerative dermatitis syndrome (PUDS) is a rare disease of breeding sows with an unknown pathogenesis. Objective To describe the evolution of clinical and histopathological lesions over the course of the disease and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Animal A 24-month-old, pluriparous, large white sow presented during gestation with ulcerations around the teats compatible with PUDS. Methods and results Clinical and histopathological lesions were monitored over the course of the disease (i.e. during and after the subsequent pregnancy). A clear gestation-dependent flare of the lesions was observed with partial resolution occurring postpartum. The histological pattern presented as a lymphocytic interface dermatitis. Conclusions and clinical importance The findings in this case report link gestation with the development of clinical signs and histological changes. Multiparity appears to enhance severity and may finally result in a self-perpetuating disease. Therefore, it seems advisable to cull breeding sows after they have developed PUDS.
