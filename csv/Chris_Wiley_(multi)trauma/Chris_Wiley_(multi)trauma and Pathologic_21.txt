AB  - Background Porcine ulcerative dermatitis syndrome (PUDS) is a rare disease of breeding sows with an unknown pathogenesis. Objective To describe the evolution of clinical and histopathological lesions over the course of the disease and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Animal A 24-month-old, pluriparous, large white sow presented during gestation with ulcerations around the teats compatible with PUDS. Methods and results Clinical and histopathological lesions were monitored over the course of the disease (i.e. during and after the subsequent pregnancy). A clear gestation-dependent flare of the lesions was observed with partial resolution occurring postpartum. The histological pattern presented as a lymphocytic interface dermatitis. Conclusions and clinical importance The findings in this case report link gestation with the development of clinical signs and histological changes. Multiparity appears to enhance severity and may finally result in a self-perpetuating disease. Therefore, it seems advisable to cull breeding sows after they have developed PUDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND Blood platelets (PLTs) are a valuable commodity. Management of their inventory has implications both for patient care and for the cost of health care delivery. There are a variety of different methods of managing PLT inventory currently in practice and multiple theoretical models aimed at improving PLT inventory metrics. In this study we evaluate the ability of a novel electronic dashboard system that monitors and displays both PLT inventory and patient data to improve transfusion metrics at a quaternary health care center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Capital District Health Authority is a quaternary health care center that transfuses approximately 2500 PLT units annually. To improve PLT discard rates a novel, low-overhead system that interfaces with the laboratory information system and displays real-time data between transfusion sites on PLT inventory and orders was implemented in November 2011. This study examines the transfusion quality metrics data from the 24 months before and after implementation. RESULTS A significant reduction in mean monthly PLT outdate rate was observed after the implementation of the PLT dashboard suite from 24.5% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%) to 15.1% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%; p?<?0.001). PLT age at time of transfusion was also reduced from 3.60 days (n?=?4796, SD?±?0.97 days) to 3.46 days (n?=?4881, SD?±?1.00 days; p?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the implementation of a novel PLT dashboard suite. This suite significantly reduced PLT outdate rates at our institution over the 48-month study period.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common combat injury, often through explosive blast, and produces heterogeneous brain changes due to various mechanisms of injury. It is unclear whether the vulnerability of white matter differs between blast and impact injury, and the consequences of microstructural changes on neuropsychological function are poorly understood in military TBI patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques were used to assess the neurocircuitry in 37 US service members (29 mild, 7 moderate, 1 severe; 17 blast and 20 nonblast), who sustained a TBI while deployed, compared to 14 nondeployed, military controls. High-dimensional deformable registration of MRI diffusion tensor data was followed by fiber tracking and tract-specific analysis along with region-of-interest analysis. DTI results were examined in relation to post-concussion and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The most prominent white matter microstructural injury for both blast and nonblast patients was in the frontal fibers within the fronto-striatal (corona radiata, internal capsule) and fronto-limbic circuits (fornix, cingulum), the fronto-parieto-occipital association fibers, in brainstem fibers, and in callosal fibers. Subcortical superior-inferiorly oriented tracts were more vulnerable to blast injury than nonblast injury, while direct impact force had more detrimental effects on anterior-posteriorly oriented tracts, which tended to cause heterogeneous left and right hemispheric asymmetries of white matter connectivity. The tractography using diffusion anisotropy deficits revealed the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar-cortical (CSTCC) networks, where increased post-concussion and PTSD symptoms were associated with low fractional anisotropy in the major nodes of compromised CSTCC neurocircuitry, and the consequences on cognitive function were explored as well.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in primary and recurrent pterygia samples collected from different ethnic groups in the equatorial Malay Peninsula. Methods DNA was extracted from 45 specimens of freshly obtained primary and recurrent pterygia from patients and from 11 normal conjunctival swabs from volunteers with no ocular surface lesion as control. The presence of HPV DNA was detected by nested PCR. PCR-positive samples were subjected to DNA sequencing to determine the HPV genotypes. Real-time PCR with HPV16 and HPV18 type-specific TaqMan probes was employed to determine the viral DNA copy number. Results Of 45 pterygia samples with acceptable DNA quality, 29 (64.4%) were positive for HPV DNA, whereas all the normal conjunctiva swabs were HPV negative. Type 18 was the most prevalent (41.4% of positive samples) genotype followed by type 16 (27.6%). There was one case each of the less common HPV58 and HPV59. Seven of the samples harboured mixed infections of both HPV16 and HPV18. All the four known recurrent pterygia samples were HPV-positive, whereas the sole early-stage pterygium sample in the study was HPV-negative. There was no significant association between HPV-positive status with gender or age. A high proportion of patients from the Indian ethnic group (five of six) were HPV-positive, whereas the Malay patients were found to have higher HPV positivity than the Chinese. The viral load of HPV18 samples ranged between 2 ? 102 and 3 ? 104 copies per ?g, whereas the viral load of HPV16 specimen was 4 ? 101 to 102 copies per ?g. Conclusion This report describes for the first time the quantitative measurement of HPV viral DNA for pterygium samples. The high prevalence of oncogenic HPVs in our samples suggests a possible role for HPV in the pathogenesis of pterygia. Moreover, the relatively low HPV viral load is concordant with the premalignant nature of this ocular condition.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury can cause extensive damage to the white matter (WM) of the brain. These disruptions can be especially damaging in children, whose brains are still maturing. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most commonly used method to assess WM organization, but it has limited resolution to differentiate causes of WM disruption. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields spectra showing the levels of neurometabolites that can indicate neuronal/axonal health, inflammation, membrane proliferation/turnover, and other cellular processes that are on-going post-injury. Previous analyses on this dataset revealed a significant division within the msTBI patient group, based on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT); one subgroup of patients (TBI-normal) showed evidence of recovery over time, while the other showed continuing degeneration (TBI-slow). We combined dMRI with MRS to better understand WM disruptions in children with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). Tracts with poorer WM organization, as shown by lower FA and higher MD and RD, also showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal and axonal health and myelination. We did not find lower NAA in tracts with normal WM organization. Choline, a marker of inflammation, membrane turnover, or gliosis, did not show such associations. We further show that multi-modal imaging can improve outcome prediction over a single modality, as well as over earlier cognitive function measures. Our results suggest that demyelination plays an important role in WM disruption post-injury in a subgroup of msTBI children and indicate the utility of multi-modal imaging.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between an initial mechanical event causing brain tissue deformation and delayed neurodegeneration in vivo is complex because of the multiplicity of factors involved. We have used a simplified brain surrogate based on rat hippocampal slices grown on deformable silicone membranes to study stretch-induced traumatic brain injury. Traumatic injury was induced by stretching the culture substrate, and the biological response characterized after 4?days. Morphological abnormalities consistent with traumatic injury in humans were widely observed in injured cultures. Synaptic function was significantly reduced after a severe injury. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 attenuated neuronal damage, prevented loss of microtubule-associated protein 2 immunoreactivity and attenuated reduction of synaptic function. In contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonists 3-[(R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and GYKI53655, were neuroprotective in a moderate but not a severe injury paradigm. Nifedipine, an L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist was protective only after a moderate injury, whereas ?-conotoxin attenuated damage following severe injury. These results indicate that the mechanism of damage following stretch injury is complex and varies depending on the severity of the insult. In conclusion, the pharmacological, morphological and electrophysiological responses of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to stretch injury were similar to those observed in vivo. Our model provides an alternative to animal testing for understanding the mechanisms of post-traumatic delayed cell death and could be used as a high-content screen to discover neuroprotective compounds before advancing to in vivo models.
