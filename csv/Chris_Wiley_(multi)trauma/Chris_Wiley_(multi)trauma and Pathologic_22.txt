AB  - Aims Schwann cells myelinate axons of the peripheral nervous system. This process of myelination is regulated by various transcription factors. c-Jun and Sox-2 are negative regulators of myelination and control Schwann cell differentiation and plasticity. Schwannoma cells within tumours no longer express myelin markers, and show increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. We have shown previously that several signalling pathways are activated in schwannoma cells in situ, in particular the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo we have demonstrated that c-Jun and Sox-2 are co-regulated in Schwann cells and evidence shows that both these proteins regulate myelination negatively. In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma and traumatic neuroma. Methods and results Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to c-Jun and Sox-2 was applied to six schwannomas, and the results were compared with those seen in traumatic neuroma and normal nerve. Increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 was seen in schwannoma. Conclusions We have demonstrated increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma compared to traumatic neuroma. There was no expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in a histologically normal peripheral nerve.

AB  - ABSTRACT Subluxation of a vertebra secondary to an injury (ie, traumatic spondyloptosis) is most commonly seen in the lumbosacral joint. This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the incidence and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) in children. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years of age treated for DFSP over a period of 11 years (2000?2011) in Madrid, Spain. The sample consisted of 13 children. The average annual incidence of DFSP in the pediatric population corresponded to 1.02 cases per million person-years (95% confidence interval 0.55, 1.73). Sites of involvement were diverse, with 15.3% of tumors found in acral locations. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm ? 3 cm and the median time from apparent onset to diagnosis was 36 months. Histopathologic examination revealed conventional (77.0%), pigmented (15.4%), and myxoid (7.6%) variants. The mitotic index was consistently <5 per 10 high-power fields. All lesions were removed using surgical excision. One patient developed a local recurrence because of initial affected margins; none developed metastases. The median duration of clinical follow-up was 70.5 months. This study estimated the average annual incidence rate of DFSP in a population of patients younger than 18 years and reviewed the experience of several hospitals in the management of this tumor.

Conversations between the author and ?Gabrielle? explore two areas not regarded as priorities by Winnicott: the transgenerational transmission of pathology/trauma, and the ways that language, in general ? and given names, in particular ? organize individual subjectivity. The question raised is to what degree Winnicott ? who described the treatment as ?psychoanalysis partagé [shared]? due to the parents? involvement ? thought of the pathology itself as ?shared.? The goal is not to supplant but to expand Winnicott's understanding of the case, borrowing insights from the work of Lacan and others.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with various neurocognitive deficits, and rapid assessment of the damage is potentially important for the prevention and treatment of these deficits. Imaging assessment of mild or moderate damage outside the primary lesion area after TBI, however, remains challenging. Magnetization transfer (MT) has clearly been underutilized in imaging the damage caused by TBI. Here, we applied the MT ratio (MTR) using sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) to study microstructural tissue damage in the thalamocortical pathway outside the primary lesion in a lateral fluid percussion injury rat model of TBI, 5 months after injury. MTR was decreased in layers VIb-IV of the barrel cortex and related subcortical areas, mainly indicating demyelination, which was verified by histology. The largest MTR change in the cortex was in layer VIb (?8.2%, pFDR = 0.01), and the largest MTR change in the subcortical areas was in the caudal-most portion of the internal capsule (?11.0%, pFDR < 0.005). These areas exhibited the greatest demyelination and substantial cellularity attributed to gliosis. Correlation analysis of group-averaged results from the subcortical areas revealed an excellent correlation of MTR with myelin (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001), but no correlation with increased cellularity as detected by Nissl staining. Thus, MTR using SWIFT can be a valuable tool for the assessment of subtle changes after TBI in both cortical and subcortical areas.

AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose. This article constitutes the first effort to consider debasement employing the Millon Clinical Multi-axial Inventory III (MCMI-III) in a forensic clinical population and incorporating the recommendations of Van Denburg and Choca (1997). It considers the proposition (Rogers, 1990a) that the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering can be rejected in favour of the adaptional model. Methods. A total of 142 MCMI-III profiles were collected over a 17-month period by a forensic psychology service. Of these, 47 had Debasement scale scores greater than 74. From the remaining 75, a group of 47 were randomly selected for comparative purposes. Of the total sample there were 75 males and 19 females, 68 were out-patients and 26 were in-patients, the latter having been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, applicable to England and Wales. The two groups were compared on personality variables, offending history, presenting problems and referral circumstances. Results. There is tentative support for Rogers (1990a) in that situational variables appear to have a significant impact on debasement as would be predicted by the adaptional model of malingering. However, this was insufficient evidence to reject the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering. Conclusions. It is suggested that a longitudinal study examining the impact of different stages of the mental health or criminal justice system on debasement, and other validity scales, would illuminate the adaptional model further. Factors that influence the inclination to exaggerate psychopathology and which could be manipulated experimentally are also noted. Some speculation about the possible combined use of Debasement and Histrionic, Narcissistic and Compulsive scales in distinguishing between malingerers is offered.

AB  - Objective To better characterize intrastent pathology using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients presenting with late and very late stent thrombosis (LST/VLST). Background The contribution of specific intrastent pathologies to the development of LST/VLST is not well understood. Methods In this single-center, retrospective, observational study of 796 consecutive patients treated for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with primary PCI we identified 57 patients (7.2%) in whom STEMI resulted from LST/VLST. Of the patients with LST/VLST, 21 patients (37%) had OCT performed at the discretion of the operator during PCI for LST/VLST. Independent reviewers performed qualitative offline analysis of OCT images to determine the cause of stent thrombosis defined as the specific intrastent pathology associated with thrombus deposition. Results The principal intrastent pathology causing LST/VLST was determined to be stent malapposition in 11 patients (55%), of which 5 (25% of all LST/VLST patents) had findings suggestive of positive vessel remodeling. Neoatherosclerosis was determined to be the cause of LST/VLST in 7 patients (35%). LST/VLST resulted from uncovered stent struts in 2 patients (10%). Among all LST/VLST patients, in-hospital mortality (12.3%) and post-hospital target vessel failure (TVF) or cardiac death (21.7%, median follow-up 1.6 years) remained high. There was a trend towards decreased TVF or cardiac death (7.7% vs. 27.3% P?=?0.24) in patients who underwent OCT-guided therapy. Conclusions LST/VLST remains a significant cause of STEMI and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. OCT use at the time of PCI consistently identifies significant intrastent pathology with potentially meaningful clinical impact. (J Interven Cardiol 2015;28:439?448)

AB  - Abstract Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multi-functional growth factors belonging to the transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) superfamily. BMPs are expressed in a large variety of tissues and organs, where they exhibit pleiotropic functions during development as well as in the adult organism. Thus maintenance of the BMP signaling pathways requires strict control and regulation by antagonists, co-receptors and inhibitors. BMPs exert their signals by binding to hetero-oligomeric signaling complexes composed of type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity. They play a decisive role in the development of several diseases but are also involved in self-renewal of stem cells and tissue regeneration. These insights may lead to the design of future therapeutic treatments. This review focuses on the differential BMP signaling pathways initiated at distinct oligomerized signaling complexes as well as on the pathological aspects of BMP signaling in diseases and their potential for tissue regeneration.

AB  - Dr John Paul Stapp was not only the ?fastest human on earth;? he was also the quickest to stop. In 1954, Dr Stapp attained a then world record land speed of 632?mph (1020?km/h), going from a stand still to a speed faster than a .45 bullet in 5?s on a rocket sled, and then to a dead stop in 1.4?s, all in the name of safety. Stapp pioneered research on the effects of mechanical forces on living tissues during aircraft crashes. Stapp planned a series of tests on humans and set out to develop a harness to hold them. First, he used a dummy to perfect the harness and after 32 sled runs, he was ready to try it out on a human crash test dummy, himself. By 1954, Stapp had volunteered for 29 deceleration and windblast experiments. On his last run he sustained more than 40?g?s. He suffered fractured ribs and wrist, and retinal haemorrhages which left him temporarily blind. Whilst at the Air Force Stapp also began a car-crash study program to investigate fatalities in auto accidents. From this program, safety recommendations for the car industry were established including fastening seats more securely to the car body, improving bumper design and proving the effectiveness of seat belts. Stapp?s work resulted in the 3-point restraint system of today?s belts which has saved millions of lives. Stapp is also credited with coining one of the most famous phrases in history. One of his assistants, Capt E. Murphy, rigged a harness incorrectly yielding no data on the forces Stapp was subjected to. After discovering what happened, Stapp observed, ?If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.? It has been called ?Murphy?s Law? ever since.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.
