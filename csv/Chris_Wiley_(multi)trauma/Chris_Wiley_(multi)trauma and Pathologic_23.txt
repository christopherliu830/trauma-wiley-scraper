Acta Neurol Scand: 2010: 122 (Suppl. 190): 51?57. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective??? To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to clarify the actual therapeutic potential of a new transdermal drug delivery system (electromotive drug administration; EMDA) for selected patients with Peyronie's disease. Forty patients with Peyronie's disease were treated by electromotive administration of the 3-drug association orgotein-dexamethasone-lidocaine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial crossover study (study 1). Another 25 patients were treated by EMDA with a combination of verapamil-dexamethasone in an uncontrolled study (study 2). Treatment sessions lasted 20 minutes each and took place 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a current of 3 mA. Patients were assessed before treatment and at 1-and 3-month follow-up examinations. Assessments were based on sexual history, physical examination, and dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic results. Adverse effects of EMDA were not reported. In study 1, the clinical results observed after treatment proved to be significantly better than those of the placebo. Penile pain disappeared in all patients in both studies. Penile lesion (nodule or plaque) either disappeared or significantly improved in 79% and 90% of patients treated by the 3-and 2-drug association, respectively. The improvement of penile deformity also was notable although it did not match the effect observed on penile nodules or plaque (62% and 88%, in studies 1 and 2, respectively). In both studies, more than 80% of patients reported a definite amelioration of penile rigidity, which paralleled the improvement of penile dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic parameters. Overall, the combination of verapamil-dexamethasone achieved better clinical results than the 3-drug combination. Electromotive drug administration is a novel technique capable of safely achieving satisfactory results in selected patients with Peyronie's disease not only in terms of improvement of patient's symptoms but also due to the reduced need for penile surgery.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the incidence of spinal fractures and their outcomes in the elderly who fall from low-levels in a suburban county. Design Retrospective county-wide trauma registry review from 2004 to 2013. Setting Suburban county with regionalized trauma care consisting of 11 hospitals. Participants Adult trauma patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted after falling from <3 feet. Measurements Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Results Spinal fractures occurred in 18% of 4,202 older adult patients admitted following trauma over this 10-year time period, in the following distribution: 43% cervical spine, 5.7% thoracic, 4.9% lumbar spine, 36% sacrococcygeal, and 9.6% multiple spinal regions. As compared to non-spinal fracture patients, more spinal fracture patients went to acute/subacute rehabilitation (47% vs 34%, P < .001) and fewer were discharged home (21% vs 35%, P < .001). In-hospital mortality rate in spinal and non-spinal fracture patients was similar (8.5% vs 9.3%, P = .5). Conclusion Low-level falls often resulted in a spinal fracture at a variety of levels. Vigilance in evaluation of the entire spine in this population is suggested.

AB  - A three-year-old neutered female Labrador cross was presented for investigation of two corneal epithelial inclusion cysts affecting the left eye. The aetiopathogenesis of the cyst formation was suspected to be traumatic. The cysts were removed successfully by superficial keratectomy, followed by a third eyelid flap. Histologically, both lesions were represented by cystic formations lined with multi-layered squamous epithelium, consistent with stromal inclusion of surface corneal epithelium. Complete recovery was achieved, and there was no recurrence at six month follow-up.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the feasibility of T2W-SPACE technique in early detection of WD, the signal evolutions of degenerated corticospinal tract (CST) on T2W-SPACE, and their underlying pathological changes. Materials and Methods The WD model of the CST was established in 23 cats through excision of cortical origins of the tract. Eight cats were scanned with the T2W-SPACE technique at 8 sequential time points, i.e. 0 (before modeling), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 30 days after modeling, and then they were pathologically examined. The remaining 15 cats (3 per group) also underwent pathological examination at 2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 days after modeling, respectively. The ratios of T2 signal intensity (rT2s) between the affected and unaffected sides of CST were analyzed. Results During the first 4 days, SPACE could not detect any significant changes of the affected CST, although axonal degeneration was pathologically observed at the second day. From 6 to 10 days, the rT2s decreased monotonously, which is corresponded to histological findings of myelin degeneration and phagocyte proliferation. From 10 to 20 days, rT2s kept relatively stable at a low level and started to recover after that; the pathological changes of this period was characterized by marked phagocytizing activities. Conclusion SPACE technique can detect Wallerian degeneration at an early stage, and the signal evolution is consistent with the pathological processes. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;42:1134?1143.

AB  - Summary Multidetector-row computed tomographic contrast angiography (MDCTA) is routinely employed to investigate vascular masses in human patients but, to date, the use of this technique to investigate an aneurysmal mass has not been reported in an equine case. The potential of MDCTA to investigate a right-sided parapharyngeal mass in a 6-week-old Thoroughbred foal was therefore investigated. A 4-slice helical computed tomography scanner was used on a superficial, firm, ovoid mass yielding arterial blood on fine needle aspiration. MDCTA enabled identification of the vessels involved thus assisting in forming a diagnosis based on the morphology of the lesion and aided surgical planning. Histology confirmed the presence of mural thrombus and calcification within the smooth muscle wall consistent with a true aneurysm. MDCTA provided additional information to conventional imaging in this case of vascular masses of the head and neck. The technique therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis and assist in the management of such lesions.

AB  - Hip fractures in the elderly are a serious problem for the health service due to the high rate of complications. One of these complications is pressure ulcers that, according to the literature, occur in 8.8% to 55% of patients and mainly arise in the sacral area. The present randomised controlled trial tests whether applying a new innovative multi-layer polyurethane foam dressing (ALLEVYN LIFE?), reduces the onset of pressure ulcers in the sacral area. From March to December 2016, 359 fragility hip fracture patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 182 in the control group and 177 in the experimental group. Pressure ulcers occurred overall in 36 patients (10%): 8 patients (4.5%) in the experimental group compared to 28 (15.4%) in the control group: P = 0.001, relative risk 0.29 (95% CI 0.14-0.61) with NNT of 9 (95% CI 6-21). In the experimental group the onset of pressure ulcers occurred on average on the 6th day compared to the 4th day in the control group (HR 4.4). Using polyurethane foam is effective at reducing the rate of pressure ulcers in the sacrum in elderly patients with hip fracture. The adhesiveness of this device also enables costs to be kept down.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant inflammation which contributes to the evolving pathology. Previously, we have demonstrated that cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule involved in inflammation, is down-regulated after TBI. To determine the mechanism by which cAMP is down-regulated after TBI, we determined whether TBI induces changes in phosphodiesterase (PDE) expression. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (FPI) or sham injury, and the ipsilateral, parietal cortex was analyzed by western blotting. In the ipsilateral parietal cortex, expression of PDE1A, PDE4B2, and PDE4D2, significantly increased from 30 min to 24 h post-injury. PDE10A significantly increased at 6 and 24 h after TBI. Phosphorylation of PDE4A significantly increased from 6 h to 7 days post-injury. In contrast, PDE1B, PD4A5, and PDE4A8 significantly decreased after TBI. No changes were observed with PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4B1/3, PDE4B4, PDE4D3, PDE4D4, PDE8A, or PDE8B. Co-localization studies showed that PDE1A, PDE4B2, and phospho-PDE4A were neuronally expressed, whereas PDE4D2 was expressed in neither neurons nor glia. These findings suggest that therapies to reduce inflammation after TBI could be facilitated with targeted therapies, in particular for PDE1A, PDE4B2, PDE4D2, or PDE10A.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Aims Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness, spasticity, paralysis and death usually within 2?5 years of onset. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS pathology characterized by activation of glial cells, which respond by upregulating small heat shock proteins (HSPBs), but the exact underlying pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the association between ALS disease duration, lower motor neuron loss, TARDNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, neuroinflammation and HSPB expression. Methods With immunohistochemistry, we examined HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB6, HSPB8 and HSP16.2 expression in cervical, thoracic and sacral spinal cord regions in 12 ALS cases, seven with short disease duration (SDD), five with moderate disease duration (MDD), and ten age-matched controls. Expression was quantified using ImageJ to examine HSP expression, motor neuron numbers, microglial and astrocyte density and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43+) inclusions. Results SDD was associated with elevated HSPB5 and 8 expression in lateral tract astrocytes, while HSP16.2 expression was increased in astrocytes in MDD cases. SDD cases had higher numbers of motor neurons and microglial activation than MDD cases, but similar levels of motor neurons with pTDP-43+ inclusions. Conclusions Increased expression of several HSPBs in lateral column astrocytes suggests that astrocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. SDD is associated with increased microgliosis, HSPB5 and 8 expression in astrocytes, and only minor changes in motor neuron loss. This suggests that the interaction between motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes determines neuronal fate and functional decline in ALS.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND To assess whether the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) detection via a multi (≥12)-core prostate biopsy. METHODS From January 2004 to May 2011, 3,107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 3 and 20?ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the potential association of LUTS and PCa detection via biopsy. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve. RESULTS The median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 11, and the mean PSA was 6.81?ng/ml. Of the total subjects, PCa was detected from biopsy in 931 (30.0%) patients. In a comparison of 1,465 patients with IPSS ≥11 and 1,642 patients with IPSS <11, those with a higher IPSS were older, had higher PSA and had a larger prostate, but there were no significant differences in the PCa detection rates. However, in multivariate analysis incorporating other associated variables, a higher IPSS was significantly associated with lower odds of PCa detection (P?=?0.016). Nevertheless, addition of the IPSS did not significantly increase the accuracy of the multivariate model devised for the detection of PCa (P?=?0.098). CONCLUSIONS Although PCa was detected less commonly among men with higher LUTS, LUTS may not provide additional prognostic information beyond that which can be obtained via previously established prognostic factors.

AB  - Abstract Warfare impacts how people and populations can move about the landscape. Ethnographers have posited that internal warfare, conflict that takes place within a single society, is strongly associated with female abduction. In contrast, external warfare, combat between different societies, is often accompanied by the in-migration of men for purposes of defence. To test this assertion, we evaluate human remains from one of the most violent eras in Andean prehistory, the Late Intermediate Period (ad 1000?1400). In the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru, this era witnessed the coalescence of two formidable polities, the Chanka and the Quichua. Ethnohistoric accounts describe internal warfare among the Chanka and external warfare between the Quichua and their neighbours. In this study, bioarchaeological and biogeochemical methods are marshalled to elucidate ancient patterns of violence and mobility with greater nuance. We employ strontium isotope analysis of tooth enamel apatite to inform on residential origin, and we reconstruct patterns of violent conflict through analysis of cranial trauma. In all, 265 crania were excavated from 17 cave ossuaries at two Chanka sites and one Quichua site. Data were collected on age, sex and cranial modification?an indicator of social identity and cranial trauma. A representative subsample of molars from 34 individuals subjected to strontium isotope analysis demonstrates that among the Chanka, violence was significantly directed towards social groups within society, marked by modified crania. The presence of two nonlocal women with signs of increased morbidity and mistreatment points to possible mobility-by-abduction. In contrast, among the Quichua, men have significantly more trauma, and wounds are concentrated on the anterior. Trauma on women is lower, nonlethal, and concentrated on the posterior. This divergent pattern is commonly observed in external warfare (raids and community defence), where men face attackers and women escape them. The presence of two nonlocal men supports a mobility model of strategic in-migration. In sum, osteological and isotopic data sets are shown to reveal divergent life-course experiences not captured by the archaeological data or historic records alone.

AB  - Abstract Any discussion of the regulation of effector class must include feedback control on the magnitude of the response. The induced effector activities are biodestructive and ridding. They are, in and of themselves, unspecific with respect to self and nonself. Consequently all responses include some level of innocent bystander pathology. The regulation of magnitude is essential to keeping this level of pathology at an evolutionarily acceptable level. This is my postulated role of suppressor T-cells, more popularly referred to as Treg. In order to perform this function they must be somatically selected to be anti-nonself like all other T/B-cells. If correct, any role that they might play in determining normal tolerance is excluded. As the commentary of Ellestad illustrates, their function to regulate autoimmunity is the consensus view today and, therefore, this competing concept and my analysis of suggested papers should invite a wide ranging debate.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - Objective The identification of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among natural disaster survivors is remarkably challenging, and there are no reliable objective signatures that can be used to assist clinical diagnosis and optimize treatment. The current study aimed to establish a neurobiological signature of PTSD from the connectivity of large-scale brain networks and clarify the brain network mechanisms of PTSD. Methods We examined fifty-seven unmedicated survivors with chronic PTSD and 59 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We extracted the node-to-network connectivity and obtained a feature vector with a dimensionality of 864 (108 nodes ? 8 networks) to represent each subject?s functional connectivity (FC) profile. Multivariate pattern analysis with a relevance vector machine was then used to distinguish PTSD patients from TEHCs. Results We achieved a promising diagnostic accuracy of 89.2% in distinguishing PTSD patients from TEHCs. The most heavily weighted connections for PTSD classification were among the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VIS), somatomotor network, limbic network, and dorsal attention network (DAN). The strength of the anticorrelation of FC between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in DMN and the VIS and DAN was associated with the severity of PTSD. Conclusions This study achieved relatively high accuracy in classifying PTSD patients vs. TEHCs at the individual level. This performance demonstrates that rs-fMRI-derived multivariate classification based on large-scale brain networks can provide potential signatures both to facilitate clinical diagnosis and to clarify the underlying brain network mechanisms of PTSD caused by natural disasters.

AB  - Abstract Objectives One of the hallmarks of contemporary osteoporosis and bone loss is dramatically higher prevalence of loss and fragility in females post-menopause. In contrast, bioarchaeological studies of bone loss have found a greater diversity of age- and sex-related patterns of bone loss in past populations. We argue that the differing findings may relate to the fact that most studies use only a single methodology to quantify bone loss and do not account for the heterogeneity and complexity of bone maintenance across the skeleton and over the life course. Methods We test the hypothesis that bone mass and maintenance in trabecular bone sites versus cortical bone sites will show differing patterns of age-related bone loss, with cortical bone sites showing sex difference in bone loss that are similar to contemporary Western populations, and trabecular bone loss at earlier ages. We investigated this hypothesis in the Imperial Roman population of Velia using three methods: radiogrammetry of the second metacarpal (N?=?71), bone histology of ribs (N?=?70), and computerized tomography of trabecular bone architecture (N?=?47). All three methods were used to explore sex and age differences in patterns of bone loss. Results The suite of methods utilized reveal differences in the timing of bone loss with age, but all methods found no statistically significant differences in age-related bone loss. Discussion We argue that a multi-method approach reduces the influence of confounding factors by building a reconstruction of bone turnover over the life cycle that a limited single-method project cannot provide. The implications of using multiple methods beyond studies of bone loss are also discussed.
