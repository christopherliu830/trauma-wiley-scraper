AB  - Aim To determine which factors relate to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, in adult patients who are admitted to critical care units. Background Patient survival rates from critical care areas are improving each year and this has led to interest in the long-term outcomes for patients who have been discharged from such environments. Patients typically require invasive and extensive treatment, which places a stress on physical and mental health. Prevalence estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder in the critical care discharge population vary from 5?63%, yet it remains unclear what the predisposing factors are. Design A systematised review. Method Subject heading and keyword searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect, with 23 articles identified that examined the relationship between critical care and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Results Three main themes were identified; Critical Care Factors, Patient Factors and Experience Factors. Eight key and three potential causative factors were found: younger age, female, previous psychiatric history, length of ICU stay, benzodiazepine sedation, use of stress hormones, delusional memory and traumatic memory, delirium, GCS score of ≤9 on admission & use of mechanical restraint. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress reactions can be strongly related to the development and presence of traumatic and delusional memories. Younger patients may exclude themselves from research to avoid their traumatic thoughts. The role of prior psychiatric illness is unknown. Distinction between ?factual? and ?false? or delusional memory as occurs in the literature maybe unhelpful in understanding trauma reactions. Relevance to clinical practice There are around 38,000 occupied critical care beds each year in England. The scale of the issue is therefore substantial. Risk factors can be isolated from available evidence and provide a rudimentary risk assessment tool to inform practice development in this area.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - This paper sets out to examine the relationship between ?the inner?, ?the outer?, and ?the issue of pathology? in the family therapy field. It begins with the observations that ?pathology? has become a rarely mentioned issue in family therapy, and ?what is wrong? is increasingly located in ?the outer?: the family ?game?, ?linguistic activity? or ?the cultural discourse?. At the same time, family therapy often hosts forums in which presenters are ?attacked? for not seeming to hold the ?correct view?. The paper considers these phenomena in tandem, looks at the matter of ?method?, and applies James Hillman's critique of psychoanalysis to family therapy. The suggestion is that family therapy has been blinded by its own metaphor of ?seeing?, symbolised and literalised in the one way screen. Alternative metaphors privileging intuition, feeling and aesthetics are put forward, before discussion points are raised, and before this paper on therapy concludes poetically, or this paper concludes that therapy may be poetry.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (CE-MDCT) is used routinely in evaluating human patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) continues to be in its infancy as it relates to evaluation of the acute abdomen. The purpose of this study was to compare survey radiography, B-mode ultrasound, CEUS, and CE-MDCT findings in canine patients presenting with acute abdominal signs; with a focus on the ability to differentiate surgical from non-surgical conditions. Nineteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Inclusion required a clinical diagnosis of acute abdominal signs and confirmed surgical or non-surgical causes for the clinical signs. Agreement for the majority of recorded imaging features was at least moderate. There was poor agreement in the identification of pneumoperitoneum and in the comparison of pancreatic lesion dimensions for B-mode vs. CEUS. The CT feature of fat stranding was detected in cases including, but not limited to, gastric neoplasia with perforation, pancreatitis, and small intestinal foreign body. Ultrasound underestimated the size and number of specific lesions when compared with CE-MDCT. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was successful in detecting bowel and pancreatic perfusion deficits that CE-MDCT failed to identify. Accuracy for differentiation of surgical vs. non-surgical conditions was high for all modalities; 100%, 94%, and 94% for CE-MDCT, ultrasonography and survey radiography respectively. Findings indicated that CE-MDCT is an accurate screening test for differentiating surgical from non-surgical acute abdominal conditions in dogs. Focused CEUS following CE-MDCT or B-mode ultrasonography may be beneficial for identifying potentially significant hypoperfused lesions.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs at a high frequency in severe orthopaedic extremity injuries; however, the etiology of traumatic HO is virtually unknown. Osteogenic progenitor cells have previously been identified within traumatized muscle. Although the signaling mechanisms that lead to this dysregulated differentiation pathway have not been identified, it is assumed that inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute to an osteoinductive environment, are necessary for the development of HO. The hypothesis of this study was that cytokines related to chronic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and osteogenesis become up-regulated following severe muscle trauma where HO forms. Classification of these cytokines by their differential expression relative to control muscle will provide guidance for further study of the mechanisms leading to HO. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant up-regulation of cytokines typically associated with HO (e.g., BMP-4, as observed in the genetic form of HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva). Instead, the cytokine gene expression profile associated with the traumatized muscle included up-regulation of cytokines associated with osteogenesis and fibrosis (i.e., BMP-1 and TGF-?1). Using immunohistochemistry, these cytokines were localized to fibroproliferative lesions, which have previously been implicated in HO. This study identifies other cell and tissue-level interactions in traumatized muscle that should be investigated further to better define the etiology of HO. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a member of the metzincin family of mostly extracellularly operating proteases. Despite the fact that all of these enzymes might be target promiscuous, with largely overlapping catalogs of potential substrates, MMP-9 has recently emerged as a major and apparently unique player in brain physiology and pathology. The specificity of MMP-9 may arise from its very local and time-restricted actions, even when released in the brain from cells of various types, including neurons, glia, and leukocytes. In fact, the quantity of MMP-9 is very low in the naive brain, but it is markedly activated at the levels of enzymatic activity, protein abundance, and gene expression following various physiological stimuli and pathological insults. Neuronal MMP-9 participates in synaptic plasticity by controlling the shape of dendritic spines and function of excitatory synapses, thus playing a pivotal role in learning, memory, and cortical plasticity. When improperly unleashed, MMP-9 contributes to a large variety of brain disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, brain injury, stroke, neurodegeneration, pain, brain tumors, etc. The foremost mechanism of action of MMP-9 in brain disorders appears to be its involvement in immune/inflammation responses that are related to the enzyme's ability to process and activate various cytokines and chemokines, as well as its contribution to blood?brain barrier disruption, facilitating the extravasation of leukocytes into brain parenchyma. However, another emerging possibility (i.e., the control of MMP-9 over synaptic plasticity) should not be neglected. The translational potential of MMP-9 has already been recognized in both the diagnosis and treatment domains. The most striking translational aspect may be the discovery of MMP-9 up-regulation in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, quickly followed by human studies and promising clinical trials that have sought to inhibit MMP-9. With regard to diagnosis, suggestions have been made to use MMP-9 alone or combined with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor as disease biomarkers. MMP-9, through cleavage of specific target proteins, plays a major role in synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation, and by those virtues contributes to brain physiology and a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Background Reversed enddiastolic Doppler flow velocity waveforms on umbilical velocimetry is regarded to be associated with catastrophical perinatal outcome with a high perinatal mortality ranging from 35% to 100%. This study focused on the differences of fetal morbidity and mortality between the cases with reverse flow and other Doppler flow velocity waveforms. Method During a 10-year period we found 30 cases with reverse flow in the umbilical artery or fetal aorta (gr. I), we selected 30 cases with absent end diastolic velocities (gr. II), 30 cases with high A/B-ratio (gr. III) and 30 cases with normal A/B-ratio (gr. IV). All cases in this study were patients with similar para, gravida, maternal age and gestational ages by delivery (≤?36?weeks). Results The fetuses with reverse flow showed the highest perinatal mortality of 27% (7% in the gr. II, 10% in the gr. III and 0% in the gr. IV). In the gr. I the neonatal morbidity of 78% was also the highest (59% in the gr. II, 36% in the gr. III and 30% in the gr. IV). 80% of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) were within this group, while no IUFD has been found in the gr. IV. Furthermore, the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage by the neonates in the gr. I (28%) was also much higher than those in the gr. III (4%) and IV (0%). Conclusions Our study suggests that reverse flow represents severe fetal condition with the highest perinatal mortalities. The fetal outcome in cases with reverse flow is further worse than those with absent end diastolic flow velocity waveforms. A highest morbidity was also observed by those fetuses, especially high incidences of cerebral haemorrhage. Colour Doppler-sonography is a very useful tool to identify high risk pregnancy leading worse perinatal outcome and allows to select worst perinatal prognosis if reverse end diastolic flow is detected.

AB  - Records were reviewed of 477 patients who had diaphragm pacemakers implanted for treatment of chronic hypoventilation. Three groups were established for comparison. (1) Center group: 165 patients operated on in six medical centers participating in a cooperative study; (2) Noncenter group, sufficient data available: 203 patients operated on by surgeons with experience limited to a few cases; (3) Nonstudy group, minimal data available: 109 patients operated on as in group 2; vital statistics only were contributed. The protocol for data gathering was comprised of 154 major variables. Basic data on age, sex, diagnosis and etiology were analyzed for homogenicity of data among the groups. A comprehensive analysis of the pacing methods, complication and results fom the Center group yielded information on the early experience with diaphragm pacing important to its future application.

However, numerous extra-cardiac conditions indirectly convey changes to the echocardiographic appearance through alterations in the governing physiology. Pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary arterial pressure if a sufficient cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is occluded. This may result in dilatation of the right ventricle and, in severe cases, concomitant early diastolic septal collapse into the left ventricle. Acute respiratory failure has been shown to yield a similar echocardiographic appearance in experimental conditions due to the resultant pulmonary vasoconstriction. Echocardiography in the presence of pulmonary disease can reveal underlying cardiac pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension that contribute to the clinical severity of respiratory distress. Positive pressure ventilation affects preload, afterload, and compliance of both ventricles. The echocardiographic net result cannot be uniformly anticipated, but provides information on the deciding physiology or pathophysiology. Mediastinal pathology including tumors, herniation of abdominal content, and pleural effusion can often be visualized directly with echocardiography. Mediastinal pathologies adjacent to the heart may compress the myocardium directly, thus facilitating echocardiographic and clinical signs of tamponade in the absence of pericardial effusion. In conclusion, many pathologies of extra-cardiac origin influence the echocardiographic appearance of the heart. These changes do not reflect properties of the myocardium but may well be mistaken for it. Hence, these conditions are essential knowledge to all physicians performing echocardiography across the spectrum from advanced cardiological diagnostics to rapid point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasonography.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of warm-supplementing kidney yang (WSKY) capsule added on risperidone on cognition in chronic schizophrenic patients. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted. All 200 patients who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with WSKY capsule (n?=?100) or placebo (n?=?100) added on risperidone for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the cognitive function assessment assessed by the classic form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) at baseline and week 8. The secondary outcome measures were assessed including the positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS), the social disability screening schedule (SDSS), and the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D-17) at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. The extrapyramidal side effects were assessed each week using the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) and rating scale for extrapyramidal side effects (RSESE), while adverse events were assessed using treatment emergent symptoms scale (TESS) as additional indicators of tolerability throughout the trial. Results The response rates of the WSKY group for the number of completed categories (CC), errors responses number (ER), perseveringly errors responses number (PER), and conceptual level (CL) of WCST assessment were significantly higher than those of placebo. The reduction in the SDSS score from baseline to endpoint was significantly greater in the WSKY group than those in the placebo. There were no significant differences in the response rates for the correct responses number, perseveringly responses number (PR) of WCST between the treatment groups. The improvements in the WCST indexes, PANSS score, HAM-D-17 score were no significant differences from baseline to endpoint between the two groups at week 8.There were no significant differences in AIMS, RSESE, and TESS compared patients treated with WSKY capsule with those in placebo during treatment. Conclusion WSKY capsule added on risperidone may improve cognitive function, social function of the chronic schizophrenic patients, and the WSKY safely during treatment.
