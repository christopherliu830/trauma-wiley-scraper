AB  - A team of therapists from Minnesota and New York workied with labor union families of workers gone missing on September 11, 2001, after the attack on the World Trade Center, where they were employed. The clinical team shares what they did, what was learned, the questions raised, and preliminary evaulations about the multiple family meeting that were the major intervention. Because of the vast diversity, training of therapists and interventions for families aimed for cultural competence. The community-based approach, preferred by union families, plus family therapy using the lens of ambiguous loss are proposed as necessary additions to disaster work.

AB  - Most indications for performing echocardiography focus on the evaluation of properties intrinsic to the heart. However, numerous extra-cardiac conditions indirectly convey changes to the echocardiographic appearance through alterations in the governing physiology. Pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary arterial pressure if a sufficient cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is occluded. This may result in dilatation of the right ventricle and, in severe cases, concomitant early diastolic septal collapse into the left ventricle. Acute respiratory failure has been shown to yield a similar echocardiographic appearance in experimental conditions due to the resultant pulmonary vasoconstriction. Echocardiography in the presence of pulmonary disease can reveal underlying cardiac pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension that contribute to the clinical severity of respiratory distress. Positive pressure ventilation affects preload, afterload, and compliance of both ventricles. The echocardiographic net result cannot be uniformly anticipated, but provides information on the deciding physiology or pathophysiology. Mediastinal pathology including tumors, herniation of abdominal content, and pleural effusion can often be visualized directly with echocardiography. Mediastinal pathologies adjacent to the heart may compress the myocardium directly, thus facilitating echocardiographic and clinical signs of tamponade in the absence of pericardial effusion. In conclusion, many pathologies of extra-cardiac origin influence the echocardiographic appearance of the heart. These changes do not reflect properties of the myocardium but may well be mistaken for it. Hence, these conditions are essential knowledge to all physicians performing echocardiography across the spectrum from advanced cardiological diagnostics to rapid point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasonography.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of warm-supplementing kidney yang (WSKY) capsule added on risperidone on cognition in chronic schizophrenic patients. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted. All 200 patients who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with WSKY capsule (n?=?100) or placebo (n?=?100) added on risperidone for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the cognitive function assessment assessed by the classic form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) at baseline and week 8. The secondary outcome measures were assessed including the positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS), the social disability screening schedule (SDSS), and the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D-17) at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. The extrapyramidal side effects were assessed each week using the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) and rating scale for extrapyramidal side effects (RSESE), while adverse events were assessed using treatment emergent symptoms scale (TESS) as additional indicators of tolerability throughout the trial. Results The response rates of the WSKY group for the number of completed categories (CC), errors responses number (ER), perseveringly errors responses number (PER), and conceptual level (CL) of WCST assessment were significantly higher than those of placebo. The reduction in the SDSS score from baseline to endpoint was significantly greater in the WSKY group than those in the placebo. There were no significant differences in the response rates for the correct responses number, perseveringly responses number (PR) of WCST between the treatment groups. The improvements in the WCST indexes, PANSS score, HAM-D-17 score were no significant differences from baseline to endpoint between the two groups at week 8.There were no significant differences in AIMS, RSESE, and TESS compared patients treated with WSKY capsule with those in placebo during treatment. Conclusion WSKY capsule added on risperidone may improve cognitive function, social function of the chronic schizophrenic patients, and the WSKY safely during treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - The identification and interpretation of brain damage resulting from a non-missile head injury is often not easy with the result that the most obvious structural damage identified postmortem may not be the most important in trying to establish clinico-pathological correlations. For example patients with a fracture of the skull, quite severe cerebral contusions or a large intracranial haematoma that is successfully treated can make an uneventful and complete recovery if no other types of brain damage are present. However, not infrequently more subtle forms of pathology are present and ones that can only be identified microscopically. A systematic and pragmatic approach through the autopsy is therefore required and one that recognises the need for tissue to be retained in ways that are appropriate for cellular and molecular studies.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among young adults. Substance abusers constitute a disproportionate percentage of these patients. A history of substance abuse predicts increased disability, poorer prognosis, and delayed recovery. While consensus in the literature indicates that substance-abuse rates decline following injury, conflicting literature shows a significant history of brain injury in addicts. We reviewed the literature on substance abuse after TBI to explore the state of knowledge on TBI as a risk factor for substance abuse. While recent reviews regarding substance abuse in TBI patients concur that substance-abuse rates decline even after mild TBI, an emerging literature suggests mild TBI may cause subtle impairments in cognitive, executive, and decision-making functions that are often poorly recognized in early diagnosis and treatment. When combined with difficulties in psychosocial adjustment and coping skills, these impairments may increase the risk for chronic substance abuse in a subset of TBI patients. Preliminary results from veterans indicate these patterns hold in a combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder population with TBI. This increasingly prevalent combination presents a specific challenge in rehabilitation. While this comorbidity presents a challenge for the successful treatment and rehabilitation of both disorders, there is sparse evidence to recommend any specific treatment strategy for these individuals. Mild TBI and substance abuse are bidirectionally related both for risks and treatment. Further understanding the neuropsychiatric pathology and different effects of different types of injuries will likely improve the implementation of effective treatments for each of these two conditions.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Summary Eight horses (mean weight 438 kg) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were studied for clinical signs, ventilation/perfusion relationships (V?A/Q?) and lung morphology. Four horses were killed and necropsied after the study. In horses with COPD, minute ventilation was almost twice as high as normal, whereas PaO2 was significantly decreased. Cardiac output was normal, but pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly increased. The V?A/Q? distribution was abnormal with an increased scatter of V?A/Q? ratios. However, shunt (V?A/Q?=0) was increased in one horse only. Ventilation of dead space and high V?A/Q? regions (V?A/Q?>10) were increased markedly and comprised 74 per cent of minute ventilation. On lung biopsy, all horses showed chronic bronchiolitis with epithelial hyperplasia and metaplasia. Diffuse acinar hyperinflation also was evident at necropsy. There was a significant inverse correlation between the respiratory rate and the fractional ventilation of normal V?A/Q? regions. Also, there was a significant agreement between the extent of bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia in necropsy specimens of lungs and the degree of ventilation of high V?A/Q? regions and dead space. The findings suggest that hyperinflation of the lung due to obstructed airways may be the common denominator of increased ventilation of high V?A/Q? regions and dead space ventilation and of elevated pulmonary artery pressure in horses with COPD from chronic bronchiolitis.

AB  - Impaired white matter integrity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to deficits in various neurological functions. The differentiation of the underlying pathological processes, e.g. edema, demyelination, axonal damage, to name a few, is of key clinical interest for the assessment of white matter injury. In this study, a combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI was used to study the spatiotemporal changes in white matter at 1?h, 3?h, and 1, 2, 7 and 14?days following TBI, using a rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. Based on radial diffusivity (RD), the rats were divided into two groups: group 1 showed widespread increases in RD along the corpus callosum of the ipsilesional hemisphere at day 2, and group 2 showed normal RD. Based on this group separation, group 1 also showed similar widespread changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2 at day 2, and group 2 showed normal FA and T2. The widespread changes in RD and T2 in group 1 on day 2 were apparently dominated by edema, which obscured possible myelin and axonal damage. In contrast, the susceptibility of group 1 showed more localized increases near the impact site on day 2, and otherwise similar contrast to the contralesional hemisphere. The localized susceptibility increase is probably a result of demyelination and axonal injury. The extent of brain damage between the two groups revealed by MRI was consistent with behavioral results, with the first group showing significantly increased forelimb asymmetry and increased forelimb foot fault deficits. Our results suggest that the combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI may provide an opportunity for the differential assessment of edema and axonal damage in TBI.

AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

AB  - Summary Background Previous studies investigating factors associated with survival following endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursa are limited. Objectives To investigate the factors associated with survival in horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated endoscopically and to describe the bacterial isolates involved in the synovial infections. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods Medical records from 128 horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated by endoscopic lavage at seven equine hospitals were reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine survival and return to athletic performance. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards survival models were used to determine factors associated with survival. Results Horses underwent one (n = 107), two (n = 19), or three (n = 2) surgeries. Survival to hospital discharge was 84.4%. Univariable survival analysis revealed that administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.18?0.91, P = 0.03). Increased mortality was associated with bone fracture/osteomyelitis (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12?5.26, P = 0.03), tendon involvement (≥30% cross sectional area) (HR 3.78 95% CI 1.78?8.04, P = 0.001), duration of general anaesthesia (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00?1.02, P = 0.04), post-operative synoviocentesis (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.36?7.43, P = 0.006) and post-operative wound dehiscence (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.08?5.65, P = 0.04). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed reduced mortality after systemic antimicrobial administration prior to referral (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11?0.60, P = 0.002) and increased mortality with tendinous involvement (≥30% cross-sectional area) (HR 7.92, 95% CI 3.31?19.92, P<0.001). At follow-up (median 30 months, range 0.25?13 years, n = 70) 87.1% horses were alive, 7.1% had been euthanised due to the calcaneal injury and 5.7% had been euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses with athletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the same/higher level of exercise, 5.3% to a lower level and 3.5% were retired due to persistent lameness of the affected limb. Main limitations Retrospective study and incomplete follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae has an 84% survival rate to hospital discharge. Tendinous involvement reduced survival whilst systemic antimicrobials administration prior to referral improved survival.

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.

AB  - Abstract Background Steady increase in computed tomography (CT) utilisation in the ED was observed in countries such as the USA, Canada, China and Korea; however, limited empirical data are available regarding Taiwan. Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify and compare trends in CT utilisation in the ED over a 5 year period in a medical centre in Taiwan. Methods Electronic chart review was performed in a medical centre with an annual ED census of 80 000 patients. Subjects >20 years of age who underwent CT scans during ED visits from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were identified. Results Among the 333 673 adult ED visits, 43 635 received CT scans, with a utilisation rate of 131 per 1000. Within the 5 year span, patient volume increased by 7.7%, whereas CT utilisation increased by 42.7%. The rates of increase in patient volume and CT utilisation were 5.0% and 32.4% in non-trauma; 19.7% and 97.8% in trauma. CT scans were mostly performed on the head (47%), abdomen (36%), followed by chest (10%) and miscellaneous (7%). An increase of 168% in spinal CTs for trauma patients was observed. An increase in CT utilisation was found in all age groups with a proportionate increase with increasing age in both trauma and non-trauma. Conclusion ED CT utilisation has increased at a rate far exceeding the growth in ED patient volume. This may be attributed to the improved utility of CT in diagnosing serious pathology, more diagnostic indications for CT, ready availability and the necessity for diagnostic certainty in the ED.

AB  - SUMMARY Observations on the structural changes in experimental hydronephrosis due to complete obstruction of the lower ureter of pigs have suggested that the mechanism of renal substance loss is primarily due to a direct pressure effect on and within the papillae. As a consequence of extensive tubular rupture, disintegration or atrophy, there is a progressive loss of pyramid tissue. Initial cortical changes are secondary to changes in the papillae because of interference with segments of individual nephron units, and consist predominantly of tubular atrophy, although tubulorrhexis also occurs. The distribution of the early cortical changes is related to an anatomical fact frequently overlooked?-Henle loops are distributed within pyramids according to glomerular zones. Compression of the pelvic renal vein branches by the distending pelvis increases abnormal intra?renal pressure gradients as does focal thrombosis of peritubular capillaries and veins, and may be a contributory factor to furthering and maintaining tubular damage. There is no evidence of a major segmental ischasmic effect. Although compression of the interlobar arteries would be expected to produce general ischaemia in obstructed kidneys, the best preserved cortical areas are furthest from the blood supply, and in post?obstructed kidneys there is no evidence of a previous general ischaemic effect. During the fourth week the rate of cortical atrophy is increased, for with dilatation of the pelvis an increased effective compression force is exerted upon the lateral portions of renal lobules. When ureteric obstruction is relieved and the kidneys are allowed to repair for six months, there is a progressive reduction in kidney size in proportion to the period of obstruction. One kidney became contracted with surface scars, but there is no evidence of chronic pyelonephritis. The histological appearances of these kidneys are of amazing reconstruction of the cortex with minimal fibrosis. One incompletely obstructed kidney became larger than the contralateral kidney in the six?month post?obstructive period, although of reduced mass. Further studies on back pressure atrophy due to incomplete ureteric obstruction are required to resolve conflicting views on pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Using a quasi-experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of a standardized intervention model designed to build resiliency in children of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders and histories of interpersonal abuse. The children and mothers who participated in this study were a subset of the sample used for the Women, Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS). The children's intervention model consisted of three components: clinical assessment, service coordination and advocacy, and a psychoeducational skills-building group. Children in the comparison group received individual, group, and family services. Six-month and 12-month outcomes were examined among 253 children. Children in the intervention group improved significantly more than children in the comparison group. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comm Psychol 35: 823?843, 2007.
