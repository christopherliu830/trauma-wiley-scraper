AB  - Abstract Identifying differential responses between sexes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can elucidate the mechanisms behind disease pathology. Peripheral and central inflammation in the pathophysiology of TBI can increase sleep in male rodents, but this remains untested in females. We hypothesized that diffuse TBI would increase inflammation and sleep in males more so than in females. Diffuse TBI was induced in C57BL/6J mice and serial blood samples were collected (baseline, 1, 5, 7 days post-injury [DPI]) to quantify peripheral immune cell populations and sleep regulatory cytokines. Brains and spleens were harvested at 7DPI to quantify central and peripheral immune cells, respectively. Mixed-effects regression models were used for data analysis. Female TBI mice had 77%?124% higher IL-6 levels than male TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, whereas IL-1? and TNF-α levels were similar between sexes at all timepoints. Despite baseline sex differences in blood-measured Ly6Chigh monocytes (females had 40% more than males), TBI reduced monocytes by 67% in TBI mice at 1DPI. Male TBI mice had 31%?33% more blood-measured and 31% more spleen-measured Ly6G+ neutrophils than female TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, and 7DPI, respectively. Compared with sham, TBI increased sleep in both sexes during the first light and dark cycles. Male TBI mice slept 11%?17% more than female TBI mice, depending on the cycle. Thus, sex and TBI interactions may alter the peripheral inflammation profile and sleep patterns, which might explain discrepancies in disease progression based on sex.

AB  - Abstract Optic nerve atrophy represents the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathies leading to vision impairment. The recently described Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy (BBSOA) syndrome denotes an autosomal dominant genetic form of neuropathy caused by mutations or deletions in the NR2F1 gene. Herein, we describe a mouse model recapitulating key features of BBSOA patients?optic nerve atrophy, optic disc anomalies, and visual deficits?thus representing the only available mouse model for this syndrome. Notably, Nr2f1-deficient optic nerves develop an imbalance between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes leading to postnatal hypomyelination and astrogliosis. Adult heterozygous mice display a slower optic axonal conduction velocity from the retina to high-order visual centers together with associative visual learning deficits. Importantly, some of these clinical features, such the optic nerve hypomyelination, could be rescued by chemical drug treatment in early postnatal life. Overall, our data shed new insights into the cellular mechanisms of optic nerve atrophy in BBSOA patients and open a promising avenue for future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the relationship between spirituality, science and therapy was explored. In this paper spirituality is discussed in a more clinical context. Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed. There appear to he commonalities in response to different types of trauma. However in the area of ABI, positive outcomes have been under-reported in the literature which has focussed for various reasons on maladaptation. In viewing response to trauma as involving both the potential for positive transformation as well as suffering and burden, concepts of Frankl and Jung, spiritual belief and ?near death experience? are discussed. Examples of how families find meaning and positively appraise their experience of ABI are given.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Several theoretical models describe the structure of eating disorders (EDs), and a burgeoning empirical literature has sought to identify whether eating pathology is conceptualized best as categorical (presence or absence of disorder), dimensional (continuous), or a hybrid of categories and dimensions. Methods This study used structural equation mixture modeling (SEMM) to identify the latent structure of EDs. Items from the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) were administered to individuals with EDs (N?=?344). Select EPSI scales and body mass index were indicators in subsequent SEMM analyses. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), ED diagnoses, and select demographic variables were used as validators using chi-square or MANOVA. Results Categorical models fit the data better than latent dimensional or hybrid models. Latent profile 1 (LP1) was non-fat-phobic restricting anorexia nervosa; LP2, an obese, binge-eating class; LP3, non-purging bulimia nervosa; LP4, fat-phobic restricting anorexia nervosa; and LP5, multiple purging bulimia nervosa. External validation analyses indicated that LP4 and LP5 had the highest non-ED-related psychopathology. Discussion These findings indicate that there is substantial variability in the phenomenology of traditional DSM-based ED categories across latent profiles, and highlight the salience of certain ED phenotypes that have been debated in the literature. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:542?550)

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatic granuloma is an uncommon condition considered to be a benign, reactive lesion that usually affects the tongue. The exact pathogenesis implicated in the development of this lesion is not clear. However, trauma has been found to be a contributing factor in a majority of the cases. Clinically, it often presents as an ulceration or an indurated submucosal mass. Microscopically, it is characterized by a diffuse polymorphic cell infiltrate composed predominantly of eosinophils extending deep into the submucosa causing degeneration of the underlying muscle. Recognition of the lesion is important because it often mimics oral squamous cell carcinoma. But traumatic granuloma is self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously. This paper describes a case of traumatic granuloma on the dorsal surface of tongue in a 62-year-old woman. The clinical aspects, pathogenesis and histopathology of this uncommon lesion are discussed with an emphasis on its benign, self-limiting nature.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Patients with severe, multiple, traumatic injuries are challenging to manage in critical care. Early identification of injuries and optimal resuscitation is essential for favourable outcomes. Trauma-related haemorrhage can lead to the lethal triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis. Many trauma patients require urgent haemorrhage control and structural fixation through operative intervention. However, metabolic derangement and cardiovascular instability may delay surgery, resulting in an ongoing cycle of deterioration. Damage control surgery (DCS) may be used as a temporizing measure until the patient is stabilized in critical care. The aim of this case study is to discuss the complex issues faced in the critical care management of a severely injured patient. Design We conducted a patient case study, with analysis of care using published evidence. The key terms used to search for evidence were trauma, injury, damage control surgery, spinal fixation, critical/intensive care and nurse. Results We report the care of a trauma patient with complex, conflicting injuries requiring management of the lethal triad and DCS. The delay in subsequent definitive repair of spinal column fractures provided many challenges for critical care nurses including restricted patient mobilization, positioning and pressure ulcer prevention. A review of contemporary evidence relating to DCS reveals that whilst this technique is used increasingly in trauma, the research focuses on single system injuries. Conclusion Evidence and guidelines are required to support DCS for critical care patients with multiple, conflicting injuries including spinal fractures. For patients with delayed surgical intervention, rotational bed therapy may assist critical care nurses in meeting needs.

AB  - Abstract Data from Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD) were analyzed from 1999 to 2006 to examine the effects of different induction strategies at the time of cardiac transplantation. A total of 2090 primary heart transplants were categorized by induction with interleukin-2 receptor blocker (IL-2RB), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or no induction (NI). Probabilities for rejection and infection were estimated with parametric time-related models. Using these models, hazard was calculated for two theoretical patient profiles, one at lower risk for rejection and higher risk of infection (Profile 1) and higher risk for rejection and lower risk of infection (Profile 2). Of the 2090 transplants, 49.8% (1095) did not receive induction, 27.3% (599) received IL-2RB, and 18.0% (396) received ATG. Profile 1 patients had lower hazard for rejection with IL-2RB compared to ATG and NI (p < 0.01), but at the cost of increased risk of infection (5.0 vs. 1.8 vs. 1.6, respectively, at four wk, p < 0.01). Profile 2 patients experienced a fivefold decreased hazard for rejection when treated with IL-2RB compared with ATG and NI (p < 0.01). In patients at high risk of infection, IL-2RB reduced risk of rejection but at the expense of increased hazard for infection.

AB  - Severe variants of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) affect <2% of all FOP patients worldwide, but provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the phenotype?genotype relationships that propel the pathology of this disabling disease. We evaluated two unrelated children who had severe reduction deficits of the hands and feet with absence of nails, progressive heterotopic ossification, hypoplasia of the brain stem, motor and cognitive developmental delays, facial dysmorphology, small malformed teeth, and abnormal hair development. One child had sensorineural hearing loss, microcytic anemia, and a tethered spinal cord and the other had a patent ductus arteriosus and gonadal dysgenesis with sex reversal (karyotype 46, XY female). Both children had an identical mutation in ACVR1 c.772A>G; p.Arg258Gly (R258G), not previously described in FOP. Although many, if not most, FOP mutations directly perturb the structure of the GS regulatory subdomain and presumably the adjacent αC helix, substitution with glycine at R258 may directly alter the position of the helix in the kinase domain, eliminating a key aspect of the autoinhibitory mechanism intrinsic to the wild-type ACVR1 kinase. The high fidelity phenotype?genotype relationship in these unrelated children with the most severe FOP phenotype reported to date suggests that the shared features are due to the dysregulated activity of the mutant kinase during development and postnatally, and provides vital insight into the structural biology and function of ACVR1 as well as the design of small molecule inhibitors. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Fragility fracture accounts for a large percentage of hospital attendances and admissions in orthopaedic trauma settings. Such fractures occur as a result of weakened bone mainly due to osteoporosis. The majority of this type of fracture occurs in older people who have sustained the injury following minimal trauma or following a fall. The most common reason for hospital admission is following a hip fracture. This chapter considers fragility fracture generally and then focusses on the care of the older following hip fracture. This type of injury presents numerous challenges for the orthopaedic practitioner because it often occurs in frail older people and necessitates surgery followed by a protracted period of rehabilitation. The chapter considers how evidence based practice can be applied to ensuring that this vulnerable group of patients can receive care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes.

The most recent 545 cases from the Brain Bank for Aging Research (BBAR) were studied, with a mean age of 80.7?years and male?:?female ratio of 324?:?221. Cases with clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) 0.5 were retrieved as the best substitute of MCI. CDR was retrospectively determined from clinical charts. Pathological examinations followed the BBAR protocol (JNEN 2004). Post mortem assessment of CDR was possible for 486 cases, and was 0 in 201 cases, 0.5 in 57 cases and 1?3 in 228 cases. CDR 0.5 group was clinicopathologically classified into 33 cases with degenerative changes, nine cases with vascular changes, four cases with combined degenerative and vascular changes, two with hippocampal sclerosis, two with trauma, one with metabolic disease and six with unremarkable changes. The degenerative group was further subclassified into groups with pure and combined pathology. The former consisted of six cases each with Alzheimer change (AC), argyrophilic grain change (AGC) and neurofibrillary tangle predominant change (NFTC), three each with Lewy body disease change without parkinsonism (DLBC) or Parkinson's disease (PDMCI) and one case with progressive supranuclear palsy. The latter consisted of three cases with AC plus AGC, two with AGC plus NFTC and one each with AC plus DLBC, DLBC plus amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AGC plus DLBC. The pathological backgrounds of patients of class CDR 0.5 were varied and not restricted to AC.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Summary: We surveyed the treatment of 1 04 patients admitted to 27 out of the 46 departments of neurology (64.5%), neurosurgery (23.0%), and child neurology (12.5%) of Lombardy, the largest Italian Region (population, 9,000,000). Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy. RÉSUMÉ 1104 Patients admis dans 27 des 46 départements de neurologie (64,5%), de neurochirurgie (23,0%) et neurologie pédiatrique (12,5%), de Lombardie, la plus grande région d'ltalie (9.000.000 d'habitants), ont été inclus dans une enquête dont le but principal était d'apprécier la pénétration d'un diagnostic et d'une information clinico-pharmacologique corrects dans la pratique de routine. Une analyse detaillee et une discussion des donnees suivantes sont rapportees: les raisons de 1'hospitalisation (ajustement therapeutique, 27,3%, affirmation du diagnostic, 53,8%); les caracteristiques de la maladie, selon sa duree, ses manifestations cliniques et le type des crises; les troubles as-socies; la prevalence et les criteres d'utilisation des procedes instrumentaux de diagnostic (EEG, radio du crane, scanographie, etc ?); les modalites de prescription des medicaments antiepileptiques à l'entree et à la sortie, en mettant l'accent sur les choix par specialite; la fréquence de la monothérapie (41%à l'entrée, 47,0% a la sortie) par rapport à la polythérapie; le degré de correspondance entre les doses prescrites et les doses prises par le patient (les patients tendent plus souvent à diminuer les doses qu'à les augmenter); l'observation des effets collatéraux. Tout en confirmant certains résultats d'études récentes, ce travail illustre la possibilite de mise au point d'un programme régulier de contrôle des résultats de l'ensemble d'un systeme sanitaire dans le traitement de l'épilepsie. RESUMEN Con el fin de determinar la penetración de la información clinica y clinicofarmacológica correcta en el ejercicio médico rutinario se ha realizado un análisis en 1104 pacientes ingresados en 27 de los 46 Departamentos de Neurologia (64.5%), Neurocirugia (23.0%) y Neurología Infantil (12.5%) de Lombardia, la región italiana más poblada (población: 9.000.000). Se muestra un detallado análisis y discusión de la información que se refiere a las razones que motivaron el ingreso hospitalario: ajuste terapeiitico (27.3%); certeza diagnostica (53.8%); caracteristicas de la en-fermedad (segiin la duracion, las manifestaciones clfnicas y patron de los ataques); procesos asociados; prevalencia y criterios para uso de procedimientos diagnosticos instrumentales (EEG, isotopos radiac-tivos, CAT, etc.); patron de las recetas de anticonvulsivos en el ingreso y en el aita con enfasis particular en la seleccion especifica de la medicacion segiin la especialidad; prevalencia de medicacion unica (41% en ingreso y 47.0% en alta) en relacion a politerapia; grado de correspondencia entre dosis re-comendadas y cumplidas (siendo el infratratamiento mas comiin que la sobredosis); registrar los efectos secundarios. Este trabajo, a la vez que confirma al-gunos de los datos que, en estudios recientes, documentan que es factible llevar a cabo un programa regular de auditoria sobre los resultados de sistemas sanitarios completes concernientes al tratamiento de la epilepsia. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG 1104 Patienten, die zu 27 von 46 neurologischen (64,5%), neurochirurgischen (23%) und kinderneuro-logischen (12,5%) Abteilungen der Lombardei, der größten italienischen Provinz (9 Millionen Einwohner) überwiesen wurden, wurden in dieser Übersicht zusammengefasst, deren Hauptanliegen die Feststel-lung der Weitergabe von korrekter Diagnose und klin-isch pharmakologischer Information in die Routine-praxis war. Es wird eine detaillierte Analyse und Dis-kussion der Griinde dargestellt, die zur Uberweisung in ein Krankenhaus führten: Therapeutische Einstel-lung 37,3%, die diagnostische Uberpriifung in 53,8%, Charakteristika der Erkrankung bezuglich Dauer, klinischer Manifestation, Art der Anfalle, assoziierte Erkrankungen; Prävalenz und Kriterien für den Ge-brauch von diagnostischen Hilfsmitteln wie EEG, Komputertomogramm usw.; Art der medikamentosen Behandlung bei Einweisung und bei Entlassung mit spezieller Beriicksichtigung von spezifischer Medi-kamentenwahl; Pravalenz von Monotherapie-Behand-lung (41% bei Aufnahme, 47% bei Entlassung) gegen Polytherapie; Ubereinstimmung zwischen empfohlener und tatsachlichen Medikamenteneinnahme, wobei Unterdosierung ein häufigeres Problem als Über-dosierung war; Bericht über Nebenwirkungen. Die Ergebnisse stimmen mit anderen Untersuchungen liberein, so daß dieser Bericht die Durchführbarkeit eines regulären Priifprogrammes für das Funktionieren eines Gesundheitssystems bei der Behandlung der Epilepsie dokumentiert.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The chronic effects of neurotrauma consortium (CENC) observational study is a multisite investigation designed to examine the long-term longitudinal effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). All participants in this initial CENC cohort had a history of deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and/or their follow-on conflicts (Operation Freedom's Sentinel). All participants undergo extensive medical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments and either meet criteria for any lifetime mTBI or not. These assessments are integrated into six CENC core studies?Biorepository, Biostatistics, Data and Study Management, Neuroimaging, and Neuropathology. Methods The current study outlines the quantitative neuroimaging methods managed by the Neuroimaging Core using FreeSurfer automated software for image quantification. Results At this writing, 319 participants from the CENC observational study have completed all baseline assessments including the imaging protocol and tertiary data quality assurance procedures. Conclusions/Discussion The preliminary findings of this initial cohort are reported to describe how the Neuroimaging Core manages neuroimaging quantification for CENC studies.

AB  - Abstract Perception of our environment entirely depends on the close interaction between the central and peripheral nervous system. In order to communicate each other, both systems must develop in parallel and in coordination. During development, axonal projections from the CNS as well as the PNS must extend over large distances to reach their appropriate target cells. To do so, they read and follow a series of axon guidance molecules. Interestingly, while these molecules play critical roles in guiding developing axons, they have also been shown to be critical in other major neurodevelopmental processes, such as the migration of cortical progenitors. Currently, a major hurdle for brain repair after injury or neurodegeneration is the absence of axonal regeneration in the mammalian CNS. By contrasts, PNS axons can regenerate. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain this paradox but recent studies suggest that hacking neurodevelopmental mechanisms may be the key to promote CNS regeneration. Here we provide a seminar report written by trainees attending the second Flagship school held in Alpbach, Austria in September 2018 organized by the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) together with the Journal of Neurochemistry (JCN). This advanced school has brought together leaders in the fields of neurodevelopment and regeneration in order to discuss major keystones and future challenges in these respective fields.
