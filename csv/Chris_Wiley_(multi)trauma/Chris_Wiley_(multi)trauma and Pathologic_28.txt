AB  - Over the last decade the age of liver transplant (LT) recipients and the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) in this population have increased. There are no multicenter studies that have examined the impact of CAD on LT outcomes. In this historical cohort study, we identified adult LT recipients who underwent angiography prior to transplantation at seven institutions over a 12-year period. For each patient we recorded demographic data, recipient and donor risk factors, duration of follow-up, the presence of angiographically proven obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis) and post-LT survival. Obstructive CAD was present in 151 of 630 patients, the CAD(+) group. Nonobstructive CAD was found in 479 patients, the CAD(?) group. Patient survival was similar for the CAD(+) group (adjusted HR 1.13, CI = [0.79, 1.62], p = 0.493) compared to the CAD(?) group. The CAD(+) patients were further stratified into severe (CADsev, >70% stenosis, n = 96), and moderate CAD (CADmod, 50?70% stenosis, n = 55) groups. Survival for the CADsev (adjusted HR = 1.26, CI = [0.83, 1.91], p = 0.277) and CADmod (adjusted HR = 0.93, CI = [0.52, 1.66], p = 0.797) groups were similar to the CAD(?) group. We conclude that when current CAD treatment strategies are employed prior to transplant, post-LT survival is not significantly different between patients with and without obstructive CAD.

AB  - Background: Unplanned readmissions serve as a marker for health care quality. Risk factors associated with unplanned readmission after microvascular free tissue transfer have never been examined. In this study, we sought to identify perioperative predictors of 30-day unplanned readmission in free flap patients. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients who underwent microvascular free tissue transfer in 2011. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate independent predictors of unplanned readmission. Results: Among free flap patients, unplanned readmission rate was 7.9%. In multivariate analysis, the only factor that significantly predicted unplanned readmission (P?<?0.05) was open wound/wound infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.71). Postoperative variables significantly associated with unplanned readmission included surgical complications (OR 5.43), medical complications (OR 5.62), and unplanned reoperation (OR 3.94). Flap failure was not associated with unplanned readmission. Conclusions: In our study, the presence of either open wound/wound infection, development of surgical complications, medical complications, and unplanned reoperations were associated with unplanned readmissions. Further research in predictive factors is suggested to avoid costly, unnecessary, and preventable readmissions. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 35:13?20, 2015.

AB  - Hair and bone samples procured from the remains of Tycho Brahe were analysed by several analytical techniques. In segmented hair samples, concentrations of Fe, As, Ag and Au at the tips exceeded values for the contemporary population; however, they decreased towards the hair bulbs, similarly to Hg, indicating that recent exposure that was discontinued ~2?months prior to Brahe's death. Several other elements did not follow this pattern. Analyses of bones revealed signs of long-term exposure to Au, while many other elements were within expected ranges. Histopathological examination of bone sections yielded no signs of severe bone metabolic disorders.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Standing magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used to evaluate the distal aspect of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of lame horses. There is paucity of information comparing interobserver agreement of this imaging modality. Objectives To determine the interobserver agreement for assessment of the DDFT on sMRI using a newly developed grading system. It was hypothesised that different lesion types would be more frequently observed at different anatomical locations of the DDFT, and that interobserver agreement would be better for the presence of a lesion compared to lesion grading. Study design A retrospective study assessing interobserver agreement. Methods sMRI studies of 40 equine front feet were retrospectively graded by 2 observer teams using a newly developed grading system based on previous studies. Individual DDFT parameters and an overall DDFT grade were scored. A Pearson's Chi-square test quantified the association between anatomical location and lesion type and interobserver agreement was quantified by calculating weighted-kappa statistic. Results Observer team B found a statistically significant association between anatomical location and lesion type but observer team A did not. Interobserver agreement was fair to moderate for the majority of individual DDFT parameters. For most parameters, better interobserver agreement was found for presence of a lesion than for lesion grading. Interobserver agreement was fair for the overall DDFT grade. Conclusions Interobserver agreement was acceptable for overall DDFT grade and was better for the presence of an overall grade. Interobserver agreement was also acceptable for most DDFT parameters and was better for assessing whether a lesion was present compared to the grading of lesions. This study highlights the value of a standardised grading system for assessing the DDFT on sMRI, and provides a method to improve the repeatibilty and reliability of future studies using sMRI.

AB  - Abstract White matter damage is an important consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. Unlike rodents, ferrets have a substantial amount of white matter and a gyrencephalic brain; therefore, they may represent an ideal small mammal model to study human-pertinent consequences of TBI. Here we report immunohistochemical and behavioral results after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to the sensorimotor cortex of adult male ferrets. We assessed inflammation in the neocortex and white matter, and behavior at 1 day post injury and 1, 4, and 16 weeks post injury (WPI). CCI in the ferret produced inflammation that originated in the neocortex near the site of the injury and progressed deep into the white matter with time. The density of microglia and astrocytes increased in the neocortex near the injury, peaking at 4WPI and remaining elevated at 16WPI. Microglial morphology in the neocortex was significantly altered in the first 4 weeks, but showed a return toward normal at 16 weeks. Clusters of microglial cells in the white matter persisted until 16WPI. We assessed motor and cognitive behavior using the open field, novel object recognition, T-maze, and gait tests. A transient deficit in memory occurred at 4WPI, with a reduction of rearing and motor ability at 12 and 16WPI. Behavioral impairments coincide with features of the inflammatory changes in the neocortex revealed by immunohistochemistry. The ferret represents an important animal model to explore ongoing damage in the white matter and cerebral cortex after TBI.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multi-faceted, often chronic syndrome that may develop following an exposure to a highly-traumatic event. Given the complexity, heterogeneity, and incomplete theoretical description of this disorder, computational models of PTSD are an important tool to help understand the mechanisms, and course, of symptom presentation and maintenance in PTSD. This chapter reviews several computational modeling approaches and their implications for PTSD, including models focused on fear learning and expression, changes in arousal and reactivity, avoidance, changes in cognition and mood and intrusive recollection. It also discusses the limitations of each approach, and suggests possible directions for future research that could both advance our understanding of PTSD and help move toward a comprehensive computational account of this disorder.

AB  - Abstract Since 2007, 96 wild Queensland groupers, Epinephelus lanceolatus, (Bloch), have been found dead in NE Australia. In some cases, Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) was isolated. At present, a GBS isolate from a wild grouper case was employed in experimental challenge trials in hatchery-reared Queensland grouper by different routes of exposure. Injection resulted in rapid development of clinical signs including bilateral exophthalmia, hyperaemic skin or fins and abnormal swimming. Death occurred in, and GBS was re-isolated from, 98% fish injected and was detected by PCR in brain, head kidney and spleen from all fish, regardless of challenge dose. Challenge by immersion resulted in lower morbidity with a clear dose response. Whilst infection was established via oral challenge by admixture with feed, no mortality occurred. Histology showed pathology consistent with GBS infection in organs examined from all injected fish, from fish challenged with medium and high doses by immersion, and from high-dose oral challenge. These experimental challenges demonstrated that GBS isolated from wild Queensland grouper reproduced disease in experimentally challenged fish and resulted in pathology that was consistent with that seen in wild Queensland grouper infected with S. agalactiae.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of traumatic spino-pelvic dissociation (TSD) treated with modified bilateral triangular fixation. Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.

AB  - Purpose? The management algorithm for the complex aorta in the high-risk patient continues to evolve, especially given increasing applicability of endovascular solutions to these cases. We present three examples of aortic pathology managed in a staged fashion utilising hybrid open/endovascular techniques, as alternatives to classic aortic procedures. Methodology? Hybrid open/endovascular procedures were employed in three select cases. All patients underwent an open aortic ?debranching? procedure, in which some of the cervical/thoracic/abdominal aortic branches were relocated, to permit subsequent insertion of an endoluminal prosthesis while preserving end-organ perfusion. The stent-graft was inserted as a separate procedure. Results? All patients were males aged over seventy-five years. Two patients presented with saccular aneurysms of the mid-distal aortic arch, whereas the third patient had a Crawford type I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm associated with chronic dissection. The left common carotid/subclavian arteries were relocated in all three patients, as were the major abdominal visceral vessels in the patient with thoracoabdominal disease. Endoluminal stent-grafts were placed into the relevant portion of the aorta in all patients. Stent-graft placement was successful in all cases, with radiologically confirmed exclusion of the relevant aortic pathology. There was no mortality and no significant morbidity. Conclusion? Patients considered to be at high risk for thoracic/thoracoabdominal open aortic surgery may be suitable for an endovascular management strategy, although an accompanying surgical debranching procedure may be required to facilitate the subsequent appropriate placement of a stent-graft.

AB  - Abstract Child abuse is a significant social and public health problem in many societies. One particular form of physical abuse is inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI) ? the so-called ?Shaken Baby Syndrome?. One of the key features associated with ITBI is characteristic ocular findings ? only observed on fundal examination. It is crucial not to miss the diagnosis of ITBI as there may be implications for the safety of the child. The ophthalmologist is one key contributor to the process required to make the diagnosis of ITBI accurately and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. This article discusses some medicolegal implications of examining a child with retinal haemorrhages in the context of suspected ITBI, with practical advice for the ophthalmologist to be as objective and prepared as possible. The scientific validity of some alternative explanations advanced in court is discussed, with a strong emphasis on the literature.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - Abstract Diseases that jeopardize the musculoskeletal system and cause chronic impairment are prevalent throughout the Western world. In Germany alone, ~1.8 million patients suffer from these diseases annually, and medical expenses have been reported to reach 34.2bn Euros. Although musculoskeletal disorders are seldom fatal, they compromise quality of life and diminish functional capacity. For example, musculoskeletal disorders incur an annual loss of over 0.8 million workforce years to the German economy. Among these diseases, traumatic skeletal muscle injuries are especially problematic because they can occur owing to a variety of causes and are very challenging to treat. In contrast to chronic muscle diseases such as dystrophy, sarcopenia, or cachexia, traumatic muscle injuries inflict damage to localized muscle groups. Although minor muscle trauma heals without severe consequences, no reliable clinical strategy exists to prevent excessive fibrosis or fatty degeneration, both of which occur after severe traumatic injury and contribute to muscle degeneration and dysfunction. Of the many proposed strategies, cell-based approaches have shown the most promising results in numerous pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated success in the handful of clinical trials performed so far. A number of myogenic and non-myogenic cell types benefit muscle healing, either by directly participating in new tissue formation or by stimulating the endogenous processes of muscle repair. These cell types operate via distinct modes of action, and they demonstrate varying levels of feasibility for muscle regeneration depending, to an extent, on the muscle injury model used. While in some models the injury naturally resolves over time, other models have been developed to recapitulate the peculiarities of real-life injuries and therefore mimic the structural and functional impairment observed in humans. Existing limitations of cell therapy approaches include issues related to autologous harvesting, expansion and sorting protocols, optimal dosage, and viability after transplantation. Several clinical trials have been performed to treat skeletal muscle injuries using myogenic progenitor cells or multipotent stromal cells, with promising outcomes. Recent improvements in our understanding of cell behaviour and the mechanistic basis for their modes of action have led to a new paradigm in cell therapies where physical, chemical, and signalling cues presented through biomaterials can instruct cells and enhance their regenerative capacity. Altogether, these studies and experiences provide a positive outlook on future opportunities towards innovative cell-based solutions for treating traumatic muscle injuries?a so far unmet clinical need.

AB  - The aim of this study was to prove the effectiveness of MatriDerm? combined with skin grafting versus skin grafting alone in post-traumatic wounds treatment. At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, we treated 60 patients: 30 patients with dermal substitutes (MatriDerm?) combined with autologous skin graft and 30 with skin graft alone. Two weeks after the first treatment, 95% of wounds treated with MatriDerm? and skin graft showed a re-epithelisation, whereas it was 75?80% in the control group. We used the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and patient's self-estimation scale to assess the outcomes. Mann?Whitney U test was performed for the five items of the MSS and the results were combined to those of patient's self-estimation scale and the re-epithelialisation percentage to test the significance between the two groups. These data confirm the evidence of the clinical use of MatriDerm? technology in the healing of soft tissue wounds and prove the effectiveness of combining MatriDerm? and skin grafting for the first time. Furthermore, we observed a percentage reduction of wound contraction and in the same time an improvement of elasticity, quality of scars tissue and dermal architecture.
