AB  - The aim of this study was to prove the effectiveness of MatriDerm? combined with skin grafting versus skin grafting alone in post-traumatic wounds treatment. At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, we treated 60 patients: 30 patients with dermal substitutes (MatriDerm?) combined with autologous skin graft and 30 with skin graft alone. Two weeks after the first treatment, 95% of wounds treated with MatriDerm? and skin graft showed a re-epithelisation, whereas it was 75?80% in the control group. We used the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and patient's self-estimation scale to assess the outcomes. Mann?Whitney U test was performed for the five items of the MSS and the results were combined to those of patient's self-estimation scale and the re-epithelialisation percentage to test the significance between the two groups. These data confirm the evidence of the clinical use of MatriDerm? technology in the healing of soft tissue wounds and prove the effectiveness of combining MatriDerm? and skin grafting for the first time. Furthermore, we observed a percentage reduction of wound contraction and in the same time an improvement of elasticity, quality of scars tissue and dermal architecture.

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition that traumatic brain injury is a highly variable and complex systemic disorder that is refractory to therapies that target individual mechanisms. It is even more complex in elderly persons, in whom frailty, previous comorbidities, altered metabolism, and a long history of medication use are likely to complicate the secondary effects of brain trauma. Progesterone, one of the few neuroprotective agents that has shown promise for the treatment of acute brain injury, is now in national and international phase 3 multicenter trials. New findings show that vitamin D hormone (VDH) and VDH deficiency in the aging process (and across the developmental spectrum) may interact with progesterone and treatment for traumatic brain injury. In this article we review the use of progesterone and VDH as biologics-based therapies along with recent studies demonstrating that the combination of progesterone and VDH may promote better functional outcomes than either treatment independently.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of childhood disability, and is associated with elevated risk for long-term social impairment. Though social (pragmatic) communication deficits may be among the most debilitating consequences of childhood TBI, few studies have examined very long-term communication outcomes as children with TBI make the transition to young adulthood. In addition, the extent to which reduced social function contributes to externalizing behaviors in survivors of childhood TBI remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the extent of social communication difficulty among young adult survivors of childhood TBI (n = 34, injury age: 1.0?7.0 years; M time since injury: 16.55 years) and examine relations among aspects of social function including emotion perception, social communication and externalizing behaviors rated by close-other proxies. Compared to controls the TBI group had significantly greater social communication difficulty, which was associated with more frequent externalizing behaviors and poorer emotion perception. Analyses demonstrated that reduced social communication mediated the association between poorer emotion perception and more frequent externalizing behaviors. Our findings indicate that socio-cognitive impairments may indirectly increase the risk for externalizing behaviors among young adult survivors of childhood TBI, and underscore the need for targeted social skills interventions delivered soon after injury, and into the very long-term.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Summary Abnormal teeth in young animals may occur for many reasons ? some are genetic but others are acquired. This chapter discusses primary hereditary disorders, spontaneous anomalies of unknown cause, and dental alterations due to extrinsic factors. In addition to clinical information regarding the appearance and condition of the teeth and dental radiographic findings, a thorough evaluation of the history is often required to establish the cause of odontogenic anomalies. The chapter also covers several of the more common equine dental diseases and a few dental pathologies unique to equids. Pulpitis is one of the pathologic processes for which a pathologist may be called upon to examine a tooth histologically. Chronic degenerative changes may occur in injured teeth in the absence of pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Typical inflammatory responses, such as edema and active congestion, may increase pressure within the pulp chamber and thereby exacerbate pulpal injury through ischemia.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major disease that threatens human health. Neurotransmitters and the amygdala are found to be critical in the development and maintenance of PTSD. We aim to investigate the role of glycyrrhizin in treating PTSD. Contextual fear extinction and elevated plus maze test were applied to evaluate the anxiety and fear memory. Microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to analyze the expression of amygdala neurotransmitters in PTSD animal models and to verify the effects of glycyrrhizin on major neurotransmitters. The protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) were examined by western bolt. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced anxiety and fear memory after 1 and 7 days of PTSD modelling. In addition, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the circadian rhythm changes of serotonin and TPH2. The present study found a significant circadian rhythm change of serotonin in the amygdala in PTSD rats. Besides, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the altered serotonin diurnal fluctuations, which raises important implications for PTSD treatment.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Summary Both traumatic and atraumatic causes of head and neck pathological changes require careful selection of analgesics, sedatives and anesthetic swith key monitoring points during diagnosis and treatment. Assessment of the ABCs in severely compromised patients should be the initial focus followed by specific injury assessment. Immediate management may require endotracheal intubation prior to emergency care of associated injuries. Oral wounds, dental injuries, electrical cord bite and venomous injuries noted within the mouth or around the head are painful. Analgesia is important for these animals, and potentially general anesthesia is required to conduct a thorough examination, when the patient is stable, to assess the extent of injury. Non-traumatic causes of airway obstruction are laryngeal paralysis, pharyngeal/laryngeal, tumours, inflammation or edema, brachycephalic syndrome or collapsing trachea. Several medical and traumatic conditions cause neck pain and may be difficult to diagnose.

AB  - Abstract The study of wildlife health greatly contributes to understanding population dynamics and detecting conservation threats. The determination of the different fractions of plasma proteins (proteinogram) is an important laboratory tool to study wildlife health. The aim of this study was to characterize protein electrophoresis in wild Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) from north-western Patagonia and to evaluate differences according to age and sex classes. Once reference values of wild, apparently healthy individuals, were established, we compared these values to those of individuals received at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina for rehabilitation due to various health problems. Reference proteinograms from wild Andean condors differed only in the α 1 and ? 2-fractions between sex categories. Males showed higher concentrations of these protein fractions than females. We found clear differences between wild birds and rehabilitating individuals. Total proteins, globulins, α 1-globulins, total α-globulins, ? 2-globulins, total ?-globulins, and ?-globulins were significantly higher in rehabilitating than in wild individuals, whereas albumin, α 2, and ?1-globulins were similar between these groups. The albumin/globulin ratio, as a general indicator of health, was significantly lower in rehabilitating than in wild individuals. The results indicate the effects on different protein fractions of pathologic processes occurring in individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Our results provide useful insights, contributing to improving diagnoses and prognoses in this species. This information may also be useful to assess the health status of Andean condors in studies of wild populations and for comparisons with other bird species.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of small intestine, appendix, and colorectal. Carcinoid tumors are rare gastrointestinal tumors, the majority of which are found on the appendix. These tumors may appear as a dense mass on CT imaging, resembling a fecolith, and thus are often found incidentally on pathology when the suspected diagnosis is appendicitis. Cecal volvulus occurs in younger patients who are less-debilitated than those presenting with sigmoid volvulus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is successful in over 50% of cases of sigmoid volvulus, but decompressive colonoscopy is almost never successful in cecal volvulus. Routine diversion of extraperitoneal rectal injury such as with a loop colostomy is recommended in an attempt to avoid pelvic sepsis. New techniques for using trans-anal endoscopic placement of vacuum assisted closure sponge devices have been described for management of prolonged colorectal anastomotic leaks, but not for acute rectal trauma.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30 healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls, heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time, the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased. These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The last decade has seen the majority of primary bone tumor subtypes become defined by molecular genetic alteration. Examples include giant cell tumour of bone (H3F3A p.G34W), chondroblastoma (H3F3B p.K36M), mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (HEY1-NCOA2), chondromyxoid fibroma (GRM1 rearrangements), aneurysmal bone cyst (USP6 rearrangements), osteoblastoma/osteoid osteoma (FOS/FOSB rearrangements), and synovial chondromatosis (FN1-ACVR2A and ACVR2A-FN1). All such alterations are mutually exclusive. Many of these have been translated into clinical service using immunohistochemistry or FISH. 60% of central chondrosarcoma is characterised by either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or IDH2 mutations distinguishing them from other cartilaginous tumours. In contrast, recurrent alterations which are clinically helpful have not been found in high grade osteosarcoma. High throughput next generation sequencing has also proved valuable in identifying germ line alterations in a significant proportion of young patients with primary malignant bone tumors. These findings will play an increasing role in reaching a diagnosis and in patient management.

AB  - Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, neuroinflammatory, and -degenerative disease that affects the brain's neurophysiological functioning through brain atrophy, a reduced conduction velocity and decreased connectivity. Currently, little is known on how MS affects the fast temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation of the different large-scale, ongoing brain networks. In this study, we investigated whether these temporal dynamics are affected in MS patients and whether these changes are induced by the pathology or by the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs), an important symptomatic treatment that aims at reducing insomnia, spasticity and anxiety and reinforces the inhibitory effect of GABA. To this aim, we employed a novel method capable of detecting these fast dynamics in 90 MS patients and 46 healthy controls. We demonstrated a less dynamic frontal default mode network in male MS patients and a reduced activation of the same network in female MS patients, regardless of BZD usage. Additionally, BZDs strongly altered the brain's dynamics by increasing the time spent in the deactivating sensorimotor network and the activating occipital network. Furthermore, BZDs induced a decreased power in the theta band and an increased power in the beta band. The latter was strongly expressed in those states without activation of the sensorimotor network. In summary, we demonstrate gender-dependent changes to the brain dynamics in the frontal DMN and strong effects from BZDs. This study is the first to characterise the effect of multiple sclerosis and BZDs in vivo in a spatially, temporally and spectrally defined way.

AB  - Serial MRI facilitates the in vivo analysis of the intra- and intersubject evolution of traumatic brain injury lesions. Despite the availability of MRI, the natural history of experimental focal contusion lesions in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model has not been well described. We performed CCI on rats and MRI during the acute to chronic stages of cerebral injury to investigate the time course of changes in the brain. Female Wistar rats underwent CCI of their left motor cortex with a flat impact tip driven by an electromagnetic piston. In vivo MRI was performed at 7?T serially over 6?weeks post-CCI. The appearances of CCI-induced lesions and lesion-associated cortical volumes were variable on MRI, with the percentage change in cortical volume of the CCI ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side ranging from 18% within 2?h of injury on day 0 to a peak of 35% on day 1, and a trough of ?28% by week 5/6, with an average standard deviation of ±14% at any given time point. In contrast, the percentage change in cortical volume of the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side in control rats was not significant (1?±?2%). Hemorrhagic conversion within and surrounding the CCI lesion occurred between days 2 and 9 in 45% of rats, with no hemorrhage noted on the initial scan. Furthermore, hemorrhage and hemosiderin within the lesion were positive for Prussian blue and highly autofluorescent on histological examination. Although some variation in injuries may be technique related, the divergence of similar lesions between initial and final scans demonstrates the inherent biological variability of the CCI rat model.

AB  - Objective? To introduce the pathophysiological Tulip classification system for underlying cause and mechanism of perinatal mortality based on clinical and pathological findings for the purpose of counselling and prevention. Design? Descriptive. Setting? Tertiary referral teaching hospital. Population? Perinatally related deaths. Methods? A classification consisting of groups of cause and mechanism of death was drawn up by a panel through the causal analysis of the events related to death. Individual classification of cause and mechanism was performed by assessors. Panel discussions were held for cases without consensus. Main outcome measures? Inter-rater agreement for cause and mechanism of death. Results? The classification consists of six main causes with subclassifications: (1) congenital anomaly (chromosomal, syndrome and single- or multiple-organ system), (2) placenta (placental bed, placental pathology, umbilical cord complication and not otherwise specified [NOS]), (3) prematurity (preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour, cervical dysfunction, iatrogenous and NOS), (4) infection (transplacental, ascending, neonatal and NOS), (5) other (fetal hydrops of unknown origin, maternal disease, trauma and out of the ordinary) and (6) unknown. Overall kappa coefficient for agreement for cause was 0.81 (95% CI 0.80?0.83). Six mechanisms were drawn up: cardio/circulatory insufficiency, multi-organ failure, respiratory insufficiency, cerebral insufficiency, placental insufficiency and unknown. Overall kappa for mechanism was 0.72 (95% CI 0.70?0.74). Conclusions? Classifying perinatal mortality to compare performance over time and between centres is useful and necessary. Interpretation of classifications demands consistency. The Tulip classification allows unambiguous classification of underlying cause and mechanism of perinatal mortality, gives a good inter-rater agreement, with a low percentage of unknown causes, and is easily applicable in a team of clinicians when guidelines are followed.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
