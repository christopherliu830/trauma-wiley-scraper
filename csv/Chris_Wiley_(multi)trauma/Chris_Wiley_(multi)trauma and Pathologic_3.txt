AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma is an irreversible pathology which after occurrence is characterized by life long debilitating effects. The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of trauma in anterior permanent teeth among children and associations with independent variables. A total of 453 5th and 6th grade Arab Eastern Jerusalem schoolchildren participated. Trauma, incisal overjet and lip competence were measured by one examiner in the schools. Reasons and location of trauma were assessed by telephone interviews with the parents. The total prevalence of dental trauma was 33.8%. Severe trauma prevalence (involving dentine) was 12.6%. Severe trauma was more prevalent among boys (OR?=?2.03, P?=?0.026); children with lip incompetence (OR?=?2.71, P?=?0.001); and those with an overjet of 4mm or more (OR?=?3.73, P?<?0.001). The main reported causes for dental trauma were falling (29.1%), sports (16.4%), violence (20%) and playing (20%). According to the parents? reports, more fall-related injuries were reported at home, more sport injuries at school, more ?playing? injuries ?outside? (P?<?0.001). Combination of results with a previous study among Jewish schoolchildren demonstrated: severe dental trauma was related to overjet (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.002), lip incompetence (OR?=?2.19, P?<?0.001), gender (OR for males?=?1.54, P?=?0.005), but not to ethnicity (Arab or Jewish). The reasons for trauma observed in this study were potentially preventable. A community effort should therefore be pursued, with the aim of educating sports teachers, teachers, health personnel and schoolchildren regarding awareness of dental trauma prevention, with emphasis on utilizing mouthguards and early orthodontic intervention, when financially possible.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Limited guidelines exist regarding the optimal treatment of traumatic canine elbow luxation, and there is a lack of information on long-term functional outcome. Here we report reduction and stabilisation techniques for a series of traumatic elbow luxations and describe clinical outcome plus long-term questionnaire-based follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of canine traumatic elbow luxations (2006 to 2013) treated at five referral centres. Data recorded included signalment, luxation aetiology, time to reduction, reduction technique, surgical procedure, post-reduction care and complications. Questionnaire follow-up was attempted for all cases with owners completing the Canine Brief Pain Inventory. RESULTS Thirty-seven dogs were included. The most frequent cause of luxation was road traffic accident (n=22). Twenty cases were treated surgically. Seven dogs suffered major postoperative complications: reluxation (n=6), infection requiring implant removal (n=1). Four of the six reluxations occurred in dogs that had other orthopaedic injuries. Twenty-two owners completed the Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire: there were 13 excellent, 6 very good, 1 good and 2 fair outcomes. Outcome was not associated with the reduction technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial closed reduction, followed by surgical stabilisation if unsuccessful, results in good-to-excellent outcomes in the majority of traumatic canine elbow luxations. Reluxation was the most common major complication and there was a higher incidence of reluxation in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Non Violent Resistance (NVR) aims to change family relationships, when children and young people show violent, aggressive or self-destructive behaviour. Trauma in multi-stressed families necessitates an adaptation of the original NVR approach in order to meet these clients' specific therapeutic needs when child violence arises. The author has developed such an adaptation. This article gives an overview of the larger system aspect of the adapted NVR model, illustrating how NVR core principles are applied to help family members develop a sense of safety within the larger system, so the nuclear family itself can become a safe and supportive recovery environment. Practitioner points By differentiating between interaction patterns, parents identify safe supporters within the larger system to help develop effective responses to harmful child behaviour Therapeutic conversation centres parents? own formulation of their support needs, in order to regain their voice and experience personal agency Effective resistance to problem behaviour grows by engaging other adults in ways that facilitate parents? access to internal and interpersonal resources

AB  - Existing research suggests that approximately 19% of females experience childhood sexual trauma (CST). Little is known, however, about the parenting behaviour of mothers who have experienced CST. Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines prenatal psychosocial distress, postnatal depressive symptomatology, and caregiving behaviours of women reporting CST at or before the age of 14. Data for these analyses were obtained from mother reports and from observational protocols from a longitudinal study of low-income, rural families. Propensity score methodology was used to create a contrast group matched on family of origin variables in an effort to isolate and examine the long-term associations of CST beyond the effects of other childhood adversities such as poverty. Study findings provide evidence that women with CST histories report greater prenatal psychosocial distress compared to women without trauma histories. Findings further provide evidence for a spillover process from prenatal distress to the broader caregiving system including less sensitive parenting through postnatal depressive symptoms for women with CST histories. These results highlight the importance of screening for CST and psychosocial distress and depression prenatally. Interventions for women with CST histories and directions for future study are proposed. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that is associated with very high personal and socioeconomic costs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the relationship between complex trauma and key features of BPD, with a focus on problems with self-coherence and self-continuity. We first review evidence for the high prevalence of complex trauma in BPD patients. This is followed by a discussion of emerging knowledge concerning the biobehavioral mechanisms involved in problems related to self and identity in BPD. We emphasize three biobehavioral systems that are affected by complex trauma and are centrally implicated in identify diffusion in BPD: the attachment system, mentalizing or social cognition, and the capacity for epistemic trust?that is, an openness to the reception of social communication that is personally relevant and of generalizable significance. We formulate a new approach to personality and severe personality disorders, and to problems with self and identity in these disorders, rooted in a social-communicative understanding of the foundations of selfhood. We also discuss how extant evidence-based treatments address the above-mentioned biobehavioral systems involved in identity diffusion in BPD and related disorders, and the supporting evidence. We close the paper with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Abstract The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a ?pathologising? standpoint. Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.) aspects that have been shown to play a role in the subjective experience of various forms of suffering. Psychology has for a long time been quick to diagnose victims of traumatic experiences from an individualistic perspective, almost always positioning the ?problem? within the person. As a result of the Vietnam War, World Wars I and II and the Holocaust, the rise in the diagnosing of PTSD gave way to the labelling of trauma. Within psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder has become the way to operationalise suffering, and I would like to argue that this occludes how suffering lives in a family, a community and in gendered bodies. The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space. There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual. Women have remained, and in many ways continue to remain, silenced with minimal opportunities to name the world for themselves. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of the notion of trauma (and its intersection with gender) that arises from conflict and post-conflict situations.

AB  - Summary As one of the most startling and successful of Scorsese's films, Taxi Driver has garnered many critical interpretations. What has come to be known in academia as trauma theory is an amalgamation of different psychological and physiological observations and theorizations that attempt to understand and treat the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder or syndrome (PTSD). One of the most common consequences of psychological trauma is the repetition compulsion. Scorsese's filmic influences are vast, but the film demonstrates the stylistic influence of La Nouvelle Vague, the documentary realism of the Italian neorealists, and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. The link between The Searchers and Taxi Driver is key for understanding a rare representation of veteran's postwar integration in American cinema. Taxi Driver was Scorsese's first critical and commercial success. As a soldier, Bickle was both a disempowered pawn and empowered killer of the Vietnamese population.

AB  - Abstract:? Impaired declarative memory performance and smaller hippocampal volume have been observed in young and middle-aged adults with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These alterations may put trauma survivors with PTSD at greater risk for cognitive decline in later life. This article focuses on the emerging literature on neuropsychological impairment in aging trauma survivors, in particular, elderly combat veterans and survivors of the Holocaust. In veterans and in Holocaust survivors, PTSD was associated with substantial impairments in learning, free and cued recall, and recognition memory compared to the respective nonexposed subjects; however, in neither group was PTSD associated with impaired retention or ?rapid forgetting.? Additionally, PTSD was not associated with smaller right or left hippocampal volume in either cohort. PTSD is associated with considerable cognitive burden with age. Longitudinal studies of older subjects are warranted to examine whether PTSD is associated with accelerated aging or progressive memory loss.

AB  - Objectives To describe the CT findings in a population of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma that involved the spleen and liver. Materials and Methods Clinical records between January 2008 and June 2015 were reviewed. Thoracic and abdominal CT examinations of patients diagnosed with multi-centric lymphoma were evaluated by a board-certified radiologist. A diagnosis of multi-centric lymphoma with splenic and hepatic involvement was based upon cytological identification and immunophenotyping of neoplastic lymphocytes in cellular samples harvested from a peripheral lymph node, the spleen and the liver. Results Twelve dogs were included in this study, of which 11 had B-cell lymphoma; immunophenotyping was inconclusive in one dog. The spleen appeared normal in seven dogs and nodules were identified in five dogs. Splenic nodules were hypoattenuating in four of five dogs and isoattenuating in one of five. After contrast administration, three of five appeared hypoattenuating and two of five isoattenuating. The liver appeared normal in 10 dogs and hepatic nodules were identified in two dogs. All hepatic nodules were isoattenuating before contrast and hypoattenuating following contrast administration. Clinical Significance The CT appearance of the spleen and liver was normal in the majority of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration of the spleen and liver is recommended when using CT to stage dogs with multi-centric lymphoma.

AB  - Objectives To analyse the contemporary management of renal injuries in a UK major trauma centre and to evaluate the utility and value of re-imaging. Patients and methods The prospectively maintained ?Trauma Audit and Research Network? database was interrogated to identify patients with urinary tract injuries between January 2014 and December 2017. Patients? records and imaging were reviewed to identify injury grades, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. Results Renal injury was identified in 90 patients (79 males and 11 females). The mean (sd; range) age was 35.5 (17.4; 1.5?94) years. Most of the renal traumas were caused by blunt mechanisms (74%). The overall severity of injuries was: 18 (20%) Grade I, 19 (21%) Grade II, 27 (30%) Grade III, 22 (24%) Grade IV, and four (4%) Grade V. Most patients (84%) were managed conservatively. Early intervention (<24 h) was performed in 14 patients (16%) for renal injuries. Most of these patients were managed by interventional radiology techniques (nine of 14). Only two patients required an emergency nephrectomy, both of whom died from extensive polytrauma. In all, 19 patients underwent laparotomy for other injuries and did not require renal exploration. The overall 30-day mortality was 13%. Re-imaging was performed in 66% of patients at an average time of 3.4 days from initial scan. The majority of re-imaging was planned (49 patients) and 12% of these scans demonstrated a relevant finding (urinoma, pseudoaneurysm) that altered management in three of the 49 patients (6.1%). Conclusion Non-operative management is the mainstay for all grades of injury. Haemodynamic instability and persistent urine leak are primary indications for intervention. Open surgical management is uncommon. Repeat imaging after injury is advocated for stable patients with high-grade renal injuries (Grade III?V), although more research is needed to determine the optimal timing.

AB  - Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the facial area accounts for a significant number of admissions to the emergency department. Diagnostic imaging is almost always required, and is critical in determining patient management. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) appears consistently in the literature as the gold-standard imaging modality for facial bones, but results in a high radiation dose to the patient. This makes the application and advancement of dose reduction and dose optimisation methods vital. This narrative review presents a critical analysis of the literature concerning diagnostic imaging of facial bone trauma, with an emphasis on dose reduction methods for MDCT. Databases including Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus were used to investigate this topic, with the key words: facial bone trauma, computed tomography (CT) imaging and dose reduction. Exclusion criteria included studies on nasal bone fracturing, dental imaging, elective surgeries and paediatric imaging. The literature shows overwhelming support for MDCT, given its accuracy, efficiency and ease of operation. Noise reducing reconstruction algorithms show promise as a successful method of dose reduction in facial bone imaging. Investigations of more innovative techniques also appear within the literature, including diagnostic cone-beam CT (CBCT), intraoperative CBCT and dual-source CT (DSCT), but further research is required to confirm their clinical value.

AB  - In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma. This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also explain (to a greater or lesser extent) the enormous range of reactions to that event. These models are critically discussed in terms of their implications for counselling practice, and as guides to further research. Examples are given of ways in which the author has drawn on different theoretical frameworks to inform her own therapeutic practice in work with people experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Introduction Haemophilia is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders in the Emergency Department (ED). The most dangerous site of bleeding is the central nervous system. Aims To describe the characteristics of haemophiliacs arrived to our ED following a head trauma and to analyse the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Retrospective, analytical, observational study, conducted in a Paediatric ED. We included haemophilic patients aged from birth to 16 years who consulted after a head trauma over a 6-year period. Data collected included age, type of haemophilia and head trauma, symptoms, prophylaxis status, CT imaging, treatment and number of visits to the ED. Results About 46 males and 85 episodes were analysed. The median age was 2.38 years. Severe haemophilia A was the most frequent type of disease (50%). All head injuries were mild, and the most frequent mechanism was a collision with an object (38.8%). In 62 episodes (72.9%) the patients were asymptomatic. The rest 23 events had symptomatology, being the most common headache (26%), emesis (21.7%) and drowsiness (17.4%). Head CT was obtained in 31 episodes, founding altered results in 10 (6 of them corresponding to ICH). All the patients with ICH had symptomatology. About 37 episodes required admission. Conclusion Intracranial haemorrhage is one of the most dangerous events in haemophiliacs and it may occur after a head trauma. Our study suggests that, in case of head trauma, CT must be obtained in symptomatic patients and in those with additional risk factors. Asymptomatic patients must have prolonged observation.

AB  - This paper considers the role of pathological organizations in violence from a syncretic perspective. It begins with a discussion of the idea of syncretism in psychotherapy that is followed by an overview of the development of the pathological organization concept. Donald Kalsched's work on the self-care system is subsequently introduced to provide a complementary Jungian perspective on the role of trauma in the formation of pathological organizations. The remainder of the paper considers the role of pathological organizations in violence with particular reference to the work of Arthur Hyatt-Williams on ?the murder constellation? and J. Reid Meloy's concept of the ?psychopathic personality organization?. Two brief clinical vignettes are included to illustrate selected aspects of the theoretical material. By way of conclusion the paper evaluates some recent developments in conceptualization with particular reference to a ?trauma amplification? model of pathological organizations that could be of assistance in formulating the treatment needs of violent offenders.
