AB  - Abstract??? One of the commonly encountered dental emergencies is dentoalveolar traumatic injuries (DTIs). Unfortunately, DTIs result in fractured, displaced, or lost anterior teeth and this could have significant negative functional, esthetic, speech, and psychological effects on children thus affecting their quality of life. Although it is impossible to guarantee permanent retention of a traumatized tooth, patient age, severity of injury, and timely treatment and follow up of the tooth using recommended procedures can maximize the chances for success. This review examines the recent trends in the management of DTI to primary and young permanent teeth. Electronic search of scientific papers written in English from 1990s to 2009 was accomplished using Pub Med search engine. Dental practitioners should follow current literature and consider carefully evidenced-based recommendations that may enhance periodontal healing and revascularization of avulsed permanent teeth.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma has been repeatedly used as evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in experimental and human studies. However, there is no consensus in the literature concerning this phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined this question by comparing frontal lobe sections in seven groups of patients: Multi-infarct dementia (n= 6), AD with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, age-matched controls with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, controls with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, and young controls (n= 10). An additional series compared prospectively followed patients with a diagnosis of either multi-infarct dementia (n= 5) or AD (n= 4). Albumin was detected in white-matter astrocytes in all cases, without significant variation in intensity. In addition, diverse combinations of neurons, astrocytes, and (in AD patients) senile plaques were present in the cerebral cortex in an inconsistent manner. Semiquantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences among groups. Anti-IgG labeled astrocytes in infarcts only. Complement C3c component was detected in rare amyloid plaques in a minority (15%) of AD cases. Selective labeling of AD-specific lesions in a patchy manner was observed for serum amyloid P. We conclude that there is no immunohistochemical evidence of alteration of the BBB in Alzheimer's disease with or without vascular factors or in old age. Serum amyloid P binds avidly to AD lesions, but our findings are consistent with leakage through the BBB during the agonal or immediate postmortem period. Finally, no specific pattern of abnormality in the BBB was detected in multi-infarct dementia.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

AB  - Objectives Prevalence and risk factors of PTSD among injured garment workers who survived a major factory collapse. Methods Survivors receiving treatment or rehabilitation care at one year post event were surveyed, which included Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Specific version. Results The respondents consisted of 181 people with a mean age of 27.8 years and a majority had less than high school education (91.2%). Multivariable logistic regression found that the odds of having PTSD was higher among married (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 1.3?8.0]), those who used to work more than 70?hr/week (OR: 2.4 [1.1?5.3]), workers who used to hold higher job positions (OR: 2.6 [1.2?5.6]) or who had a concussion injury (OR: 3.7 [1.4?9.8]). Among the respondents, 83.4% remained unemployed, and only 57.3% (63 people) reported receiving a quarter or less of what they were promised as compensation. Conclusions Probable PTSD was prevalent among surviving workers of the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. Am. J. Ind. Med. 58:756?763, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary A 5-year-old Rheinlander gelding was evaluated for left hindlimb stifle lameness. The lameness was localised to the stifle, but source of the lameness was not specifically diagnosed from the physical, radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography were therefore used for further investigation since these imaging techniques image bony structures, cartilage and soft tissues. This examination showed multiple lesions in the stifle: an osteochondrosis dissecans like lesion of the medial femoral condyle, bony fragments, cartilage trauma and caudal cruciate ligament injury. The prognosis for continuing use as a sports horse was regarded as unfavourable. Therefore, the horse was subjected to euthanasia. All CT findings were confirmed by gross pathology. The CT and CT arthrography examination in this case provided a diagnosis not achieved with other conventional imaging techniques.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate the utility of a multi-echo sequence at 7 Tesla (T) for simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) MR-angiography (MRA) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of radiation-induced cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), intracranial arteries, and veins. Methods A four-echo gradient-echo sequence was implemented on a 7T scanner. The first echo was used to create TOF-MRA images, while the remaining echoes were combined to visualize CMBs and veins on SWI images. The sequence was evaluated on eight brain tumor patients with known radiation-induced CMBs. Single-echo images were also acquired to visually and quantitatively compare the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of small- and intermediate-vessels between acquisitions. The number of CMBs detected with each acquisition was also quantified. Statistical significance was determined using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Compared with the single-echo sequences, the CNR of small and intermediate arteries increased 7.6% (P?<?0.03) and 9.5% (P?=?0.06), respectively, while the CNR of small and intermediate veins were not statistically different between sequences (P?=?0.95 and P?=?0.46, respectively). However, these differences were not discernible by visual inspection. Also the multi-echo sequence detected 18.3% more CMBs (P?<?0.008) due to higher slice resolution. Conclusion The proposed 7T multi-echo sequence depicts arteries, veins, and CMBs on a single image to facilitate quantitative evaluation of radiation-induced vascular injury. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - SUMMARY The incidence of HIV and AIDS is increasing in Britain. Many of those affected are subjected to, and subject others to, powerful psychological pressures. Hitherto, the psychological care of such patients has been much influenced by cognitive-behavioural approaches and only more recently have psychodynamic insights been brought into focus. This paper reports psychotherapeutic work undertaken both directly with HIV and AIDS patients, their partners and families and with clinical teams providing medical care. The paper attempts to begin to sketch out a map of the psychodynamics of HIV and AIDS to encourage a better understanding of how clinicians can be helped to understand how psychosocial attitudes can be passed on to patients in the form of unconscious attacks and how patients can cause severe acting out on the part of clinicians as they try to resolve their own unconscious conflicts over their illness.

AB  - Objective Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a key role in the aetiology and serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We performed a genomewide analysis to identify genes whose DNA methylation levels are associated with PTSD. Method A total of 211 individuals comprising Australian male Vietnam War veterans (n = 96) and males from a general population belonging to the Grady Trauma Project (n = 115) were included. Genomewide DNA methylation was performed from peripheral blood using the Illumina arrays. Data analysis was performed using generalized linear regression models. Results Differential DNA methylation of 17 previously reported PTSD candidate genes was associated with PTSD symptom severity. Genomewide analyses revealed CpG sites spanning BRSK1, LCN8, NFG and DOCK2 genes were associated with PTSD symptom severity. We replicated the findings of DOCK2 in an independent cohort. Pathway analysis revealed that among the associated genes, genes within actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion molecular pathways were enriched. Conclusion These data highlight the role of DNA methylation as biomarkers of PTSD. The results support the role of previous candidates and uncover novel genes associated with PTSD, such as DOCK2. This study contributes to our understanding of the biological underpinnings of PTSD.

AB  - Apart from its catalytic function in hydrolyzing acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) affects cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to various insults, including stress. These responses are at least in part specific to the three C-terminal variants of AChE which are produced by alternative splicing of the single ACHE gene. ?Synaptic? AChE-S constitutes the principal multimeric enzyme in brain and muscle; soluble, monomeric ?readthrough? AChE-R appears in embryonic and tumor cells and is induced under psychological, chemical and physical stress; and glypiated dimers of erythrocytic AChE-E associate with red blood cell membranes. We postulate that the homology of AChE to the cell adhesion proteins, gliotactin, glutactin and the neurexins, which have more established functions in nervous system development, is the basis of its morphogenic functions. Competition between AChE variants and their homologs on interactions with the corresponding protein partners would inevitably modify cellular signaling. This can explain why AChE-S exerts process extension from cultured amphibian, avian and mammalian glia and neurons in a manner that is C-terminus-dependent, refractory to several active site inhibitors and, in certain cases, redundant to the function of AChE-like proteins. Structural functions of AChE variants can explain their proliferative and developmental roles in blood, bone, retinal and neuronal cells. Moreover, the association of AChE excess with amyloid plaques in the degenerating human brain and with progressive cognitive and neuromotor deficiencies observed in AChE-transgenic animal models most likely reflects the combined contributions of catalytic and structural roles.

AB  - Abstract There is growing evidence of the brain's ability to increase its reliance on alternative metabolic substrates under conditions of energy stress such as starvation, hypoxia and ischemia. We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate ?-hydroxybutyrate (?HB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of ?HB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-?HB 3?h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available ?HB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial ?HB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3?h of ?HB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h ?HB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham ?HB-infused animals. The TBI-induced 20% decrease in ipsilateral cortical ATP concentration was alleviated by 3?h of ?HB infusion beginning immediately after CCI injury.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Interstitial photodynamic therapy remains an attractive remedial option in minimally invasive surgery. Our aim in this prospective study was to evaluate the outcome following ultrasound-guided iPDT of deep-seated pathologies. Patients' reports on quality of life with clinical and radiological evaluation were the main end point parameters used to assess the outcome. Materials and Methods Sixty-eight patients were referred to the UCLH Head and Neck Centre for treatment of various deep-seated pathologies involving the head and neck region, upper and lower limbs. All patients underwent interstitial photodynamic therapy under general anaesthesia, using 0.15?mg/kg mTHPC as the photosensitising agent. Following treatment, patients were followed-up for a mean of 7 months. Results All three patients who presented with visual problems reported improvement after treatment. Also, 14/17 patients reported improvement of breathing. Improvement of swallowing was reported by 25/30 patients; while speaking improvement was evident in 16/22 patients and 33/40 reported reduction in the disfigurement caused by their pathology. All five patients with impeded limb function reported some degree of improvement. Clinical assessment showed that half of the patients had ?good response? to the treatment and a third reported ?moderate response? with two patients being free of disease. Radiological assessment comparing imaging 6-week post-PDT to the baseline showed stable pathology with no change in size in 13 patients, minimal response in 18 patients, moderate response in 23 patients and significant response in 11 patients. Conclusion This study on 68 patients with deep-seated pathologies undergoing interstitial photodynamic therapy provided evidence that PDT can be the fourth modality in the management of tissue disease.

AB  - Voting is the foundation of democracy. Limited data exist about voting characteristics of individuals with neurologic impairment including those living with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). To statistically examine voting characteristics using a convenience sample of registered voters with TBI during elections held in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina?2007, 2008. Data were collected on 51 participants with TBI during May 2007, 2008 general, and 2008 Presidential Election. (i) There was a significant difference between the Competence Assessment Tool for Voting (CAT-V) total score of participants with TBI who voted and the CAT-V total score of participants with TBI who did not vote and the CAT-V total score predicted voting; (ii) the age of the participants with TBI was predictive of voting; and (iii) being married was inversely related to voting. We find that there is variation in voting even among this small sample interviewed for the present study, and that the variation is predictable. Those with the highest CAT-Vs are most likely to vote. In addition, we find that traditional predictors of voting simply are not predictors among this TBI group, and even one, whether the person is married, has a negative effect on voting.

AB  - Summary To consider the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathology of equine joint diseases, 3 autoimmune responses were assayed in sera and synovial fluids. IgM-rheumatoid factor and antibodies to heat shock protein 65 kDa were determined by ELISA; anti-nuclear antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence to whole cell nuclear components. All parameters showed only modest increases, if any and not in a pattern related to disease, although some statistically significant increases were detected. Group analysis showed significantly elevated synovial fluid IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) in horses with OA (P<0.01), traumatised joints (P<0.01) and articular fractured bones (P<0.001). There was no significantly increased IgM-RF in the sera of horses with joint disorders compared to control horses. Significantly raised anti-heat shock protein molecular weight 65 kDa (HSP65) antibodies were only found in the synovial fluids of the horses with traumatised joints (P<0.001). No correlations were found between the synovial fluid and sera levels of IgM-RF or anti-HSP65 antibodies. Synovial fluid anti-HSP65 antibody and IgM-RF levels positively correlated in the OCD (P<0.001), fracture (P<0.01) and synovitis (P<0.05) groups. As antibodies to HSP65 correlated with IgG concentrations in synovial fluids, it is not possible to draw conclusions on HSP roles in joint disease pathogenesis. No serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence using rat liver and a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) as substrates. Compared with autoimmune responses in human and canine arthropathies, the low levels of autoimmune reactivity detected in this study can only suggest a minor contributory role to joint disease pathology in the horse. These results have 2 important implications. Firstly, other pathogenetic mechanisms should be considered and secondly, autoimmune mechanisms cannot be used to monitor disease progress and therefore should not be targetted for treatment.

AB  - Abstract Azygos vein aneurysm is a rare disease. Surgical resection is usually performed when it ruptures. To avoid the thromboembolism, procedures that do not touch or push the aneurysm are recommended. Herein, we report a case of idiopathic azygos vein aneurysm. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for right lateral chest pain. Chest enhanced multi-detector CT revealed an azygos vein aneurysm in the posterior mediastinal space. No thrombus in the aneurysm was detected before surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to treat the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 4?days after surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was a good option to treat an azygos vein aneurysm, and an enhanced multi-detector CT was useful for performing surgery safely.

AB  - A rare case of epithelioid sarcoma (ES) of the penis is presented. The patient, a 35-year-old man, was initially treated as having Peyronie?s disease, but the subsequent appearance of a subcutaneous nodule displayed a ?distal-type? ES. At immunohistochemical phenotypification, the tumor was positive for vimentin, cytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), as well as for some other multidirectional antibodies, including a membranous reaction for CD99. The review of 11 similar cases so far reported in the literature led to the conclusion that the clinicopathological characteristics of penile ES are basically the same as those of tumors in more classical locations: the age at diagnosis ranged from 23 to 43 years, the interval between first manifestations and diagnosis averaged 37 months (delayed diagnosis being common because of the slow growth rate and the harmless appearance of the lesion), the typical sign was a superficial nodule or mass, usually accompanied (better preceded) by urethral stenosis, dysuria and erectile disturbances. Total or partial penectomy was the treatment of choice in most patients, but lack of adequate follow up did not permit any definitive conclusion to be reached regarding its efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the documentation of security interventions in ED presentations between clinical notes and security records. Methods Presentations (n?=?680) were randomly selected from all ED presentations to a public tertiary referral hospital in Queensland, Australia between April 2016 and August 2017 that were perceived by the treating clinician as alcohol-related. Retrospective data, manually extracted from clinical notes and the security service database, were compared for the documentation of any security interventions. Security interventions were defined as observation without physical contact, verbal de-escalation or physical restraint by security officers. Results Forty-one presentations had security interventions documented in the security services database and, of those, 20 (48.8%) had documentation in the clinical notes. Patients who required security interventions were admitted to hospital in higher proportions compared with those who did not (73.2% vs 26.8%, respectively, P?<?0.0001). Conclusion The rate of documentation of security interventions in clinical notes was less than 50%. Documentation of critical information, including alerts and risks, in the clinical notes is an essential component of communication that the multi-disciplinary team use to ensure patient safety. Strategies aimed at improving the documentation of security interventions in clinical notes will help to optimise risk management and the safety of patients, staff and visitors along the continuum of care.
