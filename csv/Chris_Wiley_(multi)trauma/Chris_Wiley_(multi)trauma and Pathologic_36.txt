AB  - Abstract The last in a series of four papers describing how individuals' minds and bodies are affected by severe stress. The purpose is to develop a deeper understanding of what happens to stressed individuals who come together to form stressed organizations and the impact of this stress on organizational leaders. The series also explores the parallel process that occurs when traumatized individuals and stressed organizations come together to form stressed societies. Part I focused on the basic human stress response. Part II explored the more extended impact of severe, chronic, and repetitive exposure to stress on the functioning of the emotional system and the ways in which human beings tend to adapt to adversity and thus come to normalize highly abnormal behavior. The focus of Part III was on the impact of chronic stress on memory, the ability to put words to feelings and the tendency to repeat the past automatically. Part IV reviews the way attachment schemas are disrupted by trauma and how the accumulative experience of stress leads to downward spirals of anxiety and, finally, alienation if the progress of this deterioration is not stopped.

AB  - We present four patients who underwent simultaneous liver?kidney transplantation (SLK) and were diagnosed with calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA). Common characteristics included high MELD scores (mean 35.2?±?4.8) and advanced renal disease (duration range 6?44 weeks). CUA was diagnosed within the first 2 months post-SLK based on clinical features. Severe morbidity and prolonged hospital stay were observed and one of the patients died secondary to sepsis. Treatment included metabolic support, wound care, calcium level correction and use of sodium thiosulphate. CUA should be considered in the presence of painful dermatologic changes in patients status post SLK.

AB  - Summary The majority of esthetic emergencies involve fracture of the clinical crown. Traumatic conditions such as avulsion, bony fracture, extrusive and lateral luxation, and root fracture are considered to be acute and demand immediate treatment. Subacute conditions, including intrusion, subluxation, pulpal concussion, and crown fracture with pulp exposure, necessitate treatment within 24?h. In most cases, the emergency-bonded composite restoration will be the definitive restorative treatment. In the case of an esthetic emergency shortly before a social engagement, a dislodged crown or fixed dental prosthesis can be temporarily retained through the application of a little denture adhesive. Although replacement of the prosthesis may ultimately be recommended, patients may need an immediate interim repair. The responsibility of the dentist is to facilitate the long-term preservation of the natural dentition, the supporting periodontium and bone, and the surrounding soft gingival tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive transfusion (MTP) protocol design is hindered by lack of accurate assessment of coagulation. Rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides point-of-care (POC) analysis of clot formation. We designed a prospective study to test the hypothesis that integrating TEG into our MTP would facilitate goal-directed therapy and provide equivalent outcomes compared to conventional coagulation testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thiry-four patients who received more than 6 units of red blood cells (RBCs)/6 hours who were admitted to our Level 1 trauma center after r-TEG implementation (TEG) were compared to 34 patients admitted prior to TEG implementation (Pre-TEG). Data are presented as mean?±?SEM. RESULTS: Emergency department pre-TEG versus TEG shock, and coagulation indices, were not different: systolic blood pressure (94?mmHg vs.101?mmHg), temperature (35.3°C vs. 35.9°C), pH (7.16 vs. 7.11), base deficit (?13.0 vs. ?14.7), lactate (6.5 vs. 8.1), international normalized ratio (INR; 1.59 vs. 1.83), and partial thromboplastin time (48.3 vs. 57.9). Although not significant, patients with Injury Severity Score range 26 to 35 were more frequent in the pre-TEG group. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)?:?RBCs, platelets?:?RBCs, and cryoprecipitate (cryo)?:?RBC ratios were not significantly different at 6 or 12 hours. INR at 6 hours did not discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors (p?=?0.10), whereas r-TEG ?G? value was significantly associated with survival (p?=?0.03), as was the maximum rate of thrombin generation (MRTG; mm/min) and total thrombin generation (TG; area under the curve) (p?=?0.03 for both). Patients with MRTG of more than 9.2 received significantly less components of RBCs, FFP, and cryo (p?=?0.048, p?=?0.03, and p?=?0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Goal-directed resuscitation via r-TEG appears useful for management of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Further experience with POC monitoring could result in more efficient management leading to a reduction of transfusion requirements.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly associated with working-age adults and remains largely unrecognised in the elderly. In this review, Clara Martinez-Clavera et al consider three examples of delayed-onset PTSD and its frequent association, or misdiagnosis, as one of the numerous manifestations of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Finally, recommendations for pharmacological and psychological interventions are suggested.

AB  - Abstract The child welfare court system wrestles consistently with how to measure success. Preventing child deaths, ensuring child safety, enhancing child well-being, and faster permanency are some of the metrics used to assess the effectiveness of our system. This article proposes measuring child welfare courts on their principle-driven expression of values that promote the existence of resilience in families, professionals, and the system itself. It is critical to understand that trauma is not a necessary result of adversity, and the existence of protective factors can make us resilient against the triggering and onset of trauma. Child welfare court systems exist in complexity, and need to be managed for innovation and adaptability. The experience of poverty shared between families and the system is often the curse that weighs against performance, but could be the link that opens expanded capacity. The Court Improvement Training Academy at the University of Washington School of Law provides a framework of values, principles, and examples of work aimed at building resilience-oriented child welfare court systems.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Variability in clinical presentation among patients with neck pain disorders, in relation to symptom severity and the effect of the disorder on their physical and psychological function, has not been well documented. The present study examined the variability in pain intensity, physical and emotional or cognitive function in patients with non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain, and the extent to which these factors are associated at the time of referral for physiotherapy treatment. Method The study utilized a survey of patients referred for physiotherapy treatment for non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain. Seventy-two patients (mean age 58 years; SD 15.5 years) with a symptom duration ranging from four weeks to 30 years were recruited. Each completed measures of pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, and neck-pain related disability by use of the ?Neck Pain and Disability? scale (NPAD). Frequency distributions were calculated to examine variability in pain intensity, the total NPAD score and the effect of the disorder on different aspects of physical and emotional or cognitive function. Relationships between pain intensity, and physical and psychological function, were also examined. Results Pain intensity was normally distributed with a mean score of 6.3 cm (SD 2.5 cm). NPAD scores were normally distributed (mean 54.8%; SD 18%). Similar variability was noted in each of the NPAD factor scores for neck function, pain intensity, emotional or cognitive function and activities of daily living. Pain intensity was significantly (p<0.01) correlated with the total NPAD score (r = 0.55) and with each of the four effects of neck pain represented in the NPAD sub-domains (r = 0.42?0.63). Symptom duration was not significantly correlated with pain intensity, or with the severity of disability, as reflected in the total NPAD score. Conclusions The results highlight the variability between patients with neck pain, in relation to pain intensity and the effect of the disorder on physical and psychological function. Identifying the specific effects of the neck pain disorder in individual cases is important when defining the treatment objectives and selecting measures of treatment response.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - Abstract:? Traumatic experiences of violence like those that were brought about by the communist regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) are still present as if they happened yesterday, causing severe disadvantages in everyday life even after all those years. Consequently, in cases of extreme traumatization induced by political imprisonment, persecution and applied psychological methods of disintegration, regressive processes take place which corrode the ego. The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the failure of empathic connection at the time of the trauma, is the strongest characteristic of severe traumatization. As a result of this destruction for the traumatized there is an inability to keep upright an inner empathic, emotional connection. As we try to grasp, from a Jungian point of view, the psychodynamics of severe traumatization, we can speak of a powerful pathogenous complex, which I call the ?Prometheus-complex?. Gustav Bovensiepen speaks of this complex as a sub-network, a limited fragment of the matrix of all internalized experiences, consisting of internal working models, feelings and patterns of anticipation which interact mutually. The human being, captured in such isolation and paralysis of the mind, can find himself ?in the therapist? on a mental level.

AB  - Title:?Will skin pathologists ever be replaced by noninvasive diagnostic tools (computers)? Intro: There are now many new non-invasive tools being developed to diagnose skin cancer, specifically melanocytic neoplasms. Whether these tools will ever be able to diagnose as well as a pathologist remains to be seen. In this paper, we will review most of the newly developed tools and discuss their specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Method: We reviewed the literature on currently available noninvasive diagnostic tools to find the published sensitivity and specificity rates of these tools. Tools without published information on their diagnostic accuracy were not included. We tabulated the accuracy data on the remaining tools and evaluated their relative diagnostic accuracy. Results: Melafind was found to have a specificity of 68?85% and a sensitivity of 95%?100%. Siascope was found to have a specificity of 82.7% and a sensitivity of 80.1%. Solarscan was found to have a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 100%. Comments: Non-invasive tools may be helpful in managing melanocytic neoplasms in patients with numerous lesions or with lesions in a cosmetically important site i.e. face. At present these tools cannot replace the value of a biopsy, microscopically reviewed by a pathologist.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - In this single case study, I will address the question of how incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: (1) honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; (2) inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind fragmented and confused; and (3) the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims). During the course of my psychoanalysis of a paedophile, it became clear that this third form of doubt played an integral role in the patient's sexual abuse of children, a role I will link to the nature and function of paedophilia and to the experience of working psychoanalytically with a paedophile.

AB  - ABSTRACT Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary condition characterized by dense hyperostotic lesions with radiographic ?dripping candle wax? appearance. Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 have recently been identified as a cause of melorheostosis. However, little is known about the development, composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the bone lesions. We performed a multi-method phenotype characterization of material properties in affected and unaffected bone biopsy samples from six melorheostosis patients with MAP2K1 mutations. On standard histology, lesions show a zone with intensively remodeled osteonal-like structure and prominent osteoid accumulation, covered by a shell formed through bone apposition, consisting of compact multi-layered lamellae oriented parallel to the periosteal surface and devoid of osteoid. Compared with unaffected bone, melorheostotic bone has lower average mineralization density measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (CaMean: ?4.5%, p?=?0.04). The lamellar portion of the lesion is even less mineralized, possibly because the newly deposited material has younger tissue age. Affected bone has higher porosity by micro-CT, due to increased tissue vascularity and elevated 2D-microporosity (osteocyte lacunar porosity: +39%, p?=?0.01) determined on quantitative backscattered electron images. Furthermore, nano-indentation modulus characterizing material hardness and stiffness was strictly dependent on tissue mineralization (correlation with typical calcium concentration, CaPeak: r?=?0.8984, p?=?0.0150, and r?=?0.9788, p?=?0.0007, respectively) in both affected and unaffected bone, indicating that the surgical hardness of melorheostotic lesions results from their lamellar structure. The results suggest a model for pathophysiology of melorheostosis caused by somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1, in which the genetically induced gradual deterioration of bone microarchitecture triggers a periosteal reaction, similar to the process found to occur after bone infection or local trauma, and leads to an overall cortical outgrowth. The micromechanical properties of the lesions reflect their structural heterogeneity and correlate with local variations in mineral content, tissue age, and remodeling rates, in the same way as normal bone. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research

AB  - ABSTRACT This study evaluates trepanations from five well-contextualized prehistoric sites in the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru. The emergence of trepanation in this region coincides with the collapse of the Wari Empire, ca. ad 1000. Thirty-two individuals from Andahuaylas, AMS radiocarbon dated to the early Late Intermediate Period (ca. ad 1000?1250), were found to have 45 total trepanations. Various surgical techniques were being employed concurrently throughout the region. Scraping trepanations evinced the highest survival rate; circular grooving, drilling and boring, and linear cutting were far less successful. Evidence of perioperative procedures like hair shaving, poultice application, and possible cranioplasty use aimed to ensure the survival of a trepanation recipient. Postmortem trepanations, also present in Andahuaylas, were likely executed on corpses as a means of better understanding cranial anatomy and improving techniques. Similarities in trepanation patterns throughout the region attest to common motivations to engage in surgery. Although moderate physical head trauma seems to be the impetus for intervention in many cases of trepanation, other motivations included physiological and possibly psychosomatic factors. Nevertheless, treatment was not for everyone. In Andahuaylas, trepanations were withheld from subadults, females, and those individuals who practiced cranial modification.

AB  - A 9-year-old, female neutered Dalmatian was evaluated for acute onset of dyspnoea. Thoracocentesis on presentation yielded 1300 ml sanguineous fluid, while thoracic radiology and ultrasonography showed a mixed-echoic cavitary cranial mediastinal mass, sternal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. Surgical exploration of the thorax revealed a multi-lobulated red/brown cranial mediastinal mass and multiple similarly coloured ovoid nodules within several lung lobes. Histopathology revealed thymic branchial cysts with neoplastic transformation and examination of the lung was consistent with metastasis. Despite initially recovering well, acute sepsis and pyothorax resulted in cardiac arrest 8 days postoperatively. This is the first veterinary report of neoplastic transformation of a thymic branchial cyst with pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - Summary: Thirty-three patients whc had had prosthetic valves inserted in the preceding four years were investigated to estimate the value of various laboratory tests in the assessment of traumatic red cell destruction. A combination of the findings of an elevation in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and a fall in serum haptoglobir levels, was found to be a reliable and accurate pointer to the presence of red cell damage. This study indicates that the commonly used parameters of an increased reticulocyte count, a rise it serum bilirubin levels, the presence ol methaemalbumin (positive Schumm's test) and fragmented red cells in the peripheral blood, although very valuable in more severe cases, are not sufficiently accurate to be used as indicators ol minor degrees of red cell damage. Milc and clinically insignificant red cell destruction is very common in patients with artificial valves and only one case of the thirty-three studied showed no laboratory evidence of traumatic haemolysis.

AB  - Abstract Elevators are mechanical transportation devices used to move vertically between different levels of a building. When first developed, elevators lacked the safety features. When safety mechanisms were developed, elevators became a common feature of multistory buildings. Despite their well-regarded safety record, elevators are not without the potential for danger of injury or death. Persons at-risk for elevator-related death include maintenance and construction workers, other employees, and those who are prone to risky behavior. Deaths may be related to asphyxia, blunt force, avulsion injuries, and various forms of environmental trauma. In this review, we report on 48 elevator-related deaths that occurred in nine different medicolegal death investigation jurisdictions within the United States over an approximately 30-year period. The data represents a cross-section of the different types of elevator-related deaths that may be encountered. The review also presents an overview of preventive strategies for the purpose of avoiding future elevator-related fatalities.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.
