AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - Abstract This is a population-based prospective study to identify the long-term outcome of children with inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI). Twenty-two survivors were identified and followed up. Only 2 of 22 had no developmental problems at follow-up, 20 of 22 children were having different developmental problems, among them 3 of 22 were severely handicapped. Psychological tests passed 17 of 22, 5 did not pass due to severe handicap (3 children) or were too young (2 patients). Epilepsy was found in 7 of 22, being intractable in 3 cases. Serious motor problems were identified in 5 of 22. Ophthalmologic problems were found in 4 of 22. The most important predictor of adverse outcome was young age at the time of the insult. Conclusion: the outcome of these potentially healthy children is poor. The key question is prevention. Health care professionals should be more concerned about these problems.

AB  - Abstract: In toxicology studies, drug-induced arterial injury in laboratory animals continues to be a pressing issue of concern, particularly to those engaged in the discovery and development of novel therapies intended for human use. The concern is justifiably magnified because, currently, there is no unequivocal biochemical marker of arterial injury and/or toxicity in animals or man. Therefore, in laboratory animals used for toxicology studies a precise description of arterial lesions in terms of location, distribution and morphologic character is necessary so that a correlation can be drawn between structural damage and derangement of specific cardiovascular functions. The critical nature of the latter cannot be over-emphasized because this will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of toxicity, the pathogenesis of the lesion and assessment of human risk. However, in the decision making process, utilization of pattern recognition must be supported by rigorous scientific investigations aimed at establishing a link, where possible, between the deranged cardiovascular function and alterations in cellular, biochemical and molecular events. Conceivably, engagement of the molecular pharmacology target initiates a series of interactive cascades among cellular and non-cellular arterial components that culminate in organ damage. Therefore, any investigative mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the initiation and development of arterial lesions in laboratory animals must make a conscientious attempt to identify and characterize the molecular target of toxicity.

AB  - Abstract In electrocutions, death may be caused by alterations in the heart conduction system provoking ventricular fibrillation. This study aims to identify histological cardiac markers of high- and low-voltage electrocution. Two groups of decedents were evaluated: group A included 14 fatalities caused by high- or low-voltage electrocution and group B (control) included 14 fatalities due to other traumatic or disease causes. Myocardial sampling with microscopic examination was performed on all the hearts using the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains to investigate morphological characteristics that could indicate the damage caused by high- and low-voltage electrocutions. Interstitial myocardial hemorrhagic infiltration was the only differentiating finding, which was shown only in high-voltage electrocution. This pathological finding has not been previously reported, and it may be specific to high-voltage electrocution deaths. Further studies are warranted.

Data are most extensive for oral cancer. A multi-institutional pathologic validation trial for selected oral cancers provided negative predictive values of 96%. Subsequent trials should document clinical follow-up. This technique may ultimately play a wider role in the management of mucosal cancers. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;97:683?690. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Addition of increased amounts of serum and a protein (peroxidase from horseradish) to the culture medium caused structural alterations in previously confluent cultures composed of cells from the human retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. The alterations consisted in the formation of bi- and multi-layered strands, plaques and nodular structures and in the detachment of cells with formation of nude areas. These alterations resemble the frequently observed reactive alterations at the chorio-retinal junction in eyes with inflammation, trauma, retinal detachment and certain degenerative disease processes as the senile disciform macula degeneration.

Partial aneurysmectomy was employed in one case and a temporary to permanent shunt graft in the other two. The simplicity of the techniques is such that they may be used in hospitals which are not equipped for extracorporeal perfusion.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the prevalence of canine chronic pancreatitis in first-opinion practice and identify breed associations or other risk factors. Methods: Three sections of pancreas were taken from 200 unselected canine post-mortem examinations from first-opinion practices. Sections were graded for inflammation, fibrosis and other lesions. Prevalence and relative risks of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases were calculated. Results: The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis was 34 per cent omitting the autolysed cases. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, collies and boxers had increased relative risks of chronic pancreatitis; cocker spaniels had an increased relative risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis combined. Fifty-seven per cent of cases of chronic pancreatitis were classified histologically as moderate or marked. Forty-one per cent of cases involved all three sections. Dogs with chronic pancreatitis were more commonly female and overweight, but neither factor increased the relative risk of chronic pancreatitis. There were breed differences in histological appearances and 24·5 per cent of cases were too autolysed to interpret with an increased relative risk of autolysis in a number of large breeds. Clinical Significance: Chronic pancreatitis is a common, under-estimated disease in the first-opinion dog population with distinctive breed risks and histological appearances.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5 ? 10?9, 10?8, 10?7 mol/L) of P4 or 10?6 mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9 mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7 mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6 mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9 mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7 mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Background: The differential diagnosis of intraepidermal neoplasms showing cell clusters and/or single units with upward migration includes Pagets disease, melanoma in-situ, Bowens disease, and Pagetoid reticulosis. Purpose: We describe three cases of Pagets disease of the nipple with melanin pigment uptake by Paget cells. Results: Clinical and pathologic material of three women with biopsy proven Pagets disease of the nipple was reviewed. Clinically, two cases demonstrated an excoriated nipple, one of which also showed a zone of depigmentation. The clinical appearance of the third case was not available. Histologically, each case demonstrated Paget cells singly and in clusters with cytoplasmic uptake of melanin pigment. Melanocytes were found in each case, but were neither increased in number nor showed atypical forms. The dendritic processes of melanocytes were found to encase single Paget cells. Pigment was also found dispersed in the papillary dermis and within melanophages. Conclusions: Melanin pigment uptake by Paget cells represents a significant potential pitfall in ultimately arriving at the correct diagnosis. Misdiagnosing these cases as a melanocytic lesion could potentially delay the management of an underlying breast cancer. Careful examination of melanocyte and melanin distribution with respect to Paget cells is warranted in such cases.

AB  - Summary Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are rarely due to fungal agents and if so they are mainly caused by Candida strains. This case represents a PJI caused by a multi-drug resistant Pseudallescheria apiosperma, with poor in vivo response to itraconazole and voriconazole. This case differs also by the way of infection, since the joint infection did not follow a penetrating trauma. In the majority of cases, Scedosporium extremity infections remain local in immunocompetent individuals. We report a persistent joint infection with multiple therapeutic failures, and subsequent amputation of the left leg. Detailed clinical data, patient history, treatment regime and outcome of a very long-lasting (>4?years) P. apiosperma prosthetic knee infection in an immunocompetent, 61-year-old male patient are presented with this case. The patient was finally cured by the combination of multiple and extensive surgical interventions and prolonged antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB  - Summary Inflammatory conditions of the stomach are among the most common pathological entities of the gut. Helicobacter-associated gastritis is the most common single agent infection worldwide. In the west reactive gastropathy is becoming more common, usually due to drugs and/or alcohol. There are now considerable grounds for regarding reactive gastritis as a gastropathy because one characteristic of its pathology is a singular lack of an inflammatory cell infiltrate. There are other forms of reactive gastropathy, usually with prominent vascular components, such as portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Peptic ulceration is becoming less common in the west. One important factor is the decreasing prevalence of helicobacter infection, a major cause of peptic ulceration worldwide. As with gastritis, drugs are becoming the most important causative factor. However, peptic ulceration, as a whole, remains important, in both the stomach and the duodenum, not least because of the very considerable morbidity of its complications. Although less common than reactive gastropathy and Helicobacter-associated gastritis, there are other important forms of gastritis. Chronic atrophic gastritis is now accepted, principally, as a long-term consequence of helicobacter infection in the stomach. It is often difficult to diagnose on biopsy, but is an important predisposing factor to carcinoma and primary endocrine tumours of the stomach. Not surprisingly, given the highly acidic surroundings, infections other than with Helicobacter sp., which is especially adapted for life in the harsh environment of the stomach, are unusual but they do occur, especially viral gastritides. Lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous gastritis, collagenous gastritis and eosinophilic gastritis all provide interesting pathological problems and have important associations.

AB  - This article is underpinned by the premise that for recovery, healing and post-traumatic growth to occur after traumatic events such as technological and natural disasters, massacres and terrorist attacks, effective therapeutic services need to be offered at both the individual and community level. Frequently, responses to such traumatic instances have been conceptualised as discrete, polarised interventions offered by various groups of health and welfare professionals at various points post the traumatic event. Traditionally when therapeutic interventions are considered, many practitioners assume that the response would, and should, focus primarily and narrowly, on individuals or their families and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Conversely, the perceived role of community wide interventions has been unnecessarily limited to disaster relief or organised emergency responses most usually offered at the time of the crisis. The consequence of these limited understandings is an apparent failure to explore fully the therapeutic or mediating role of social or community support in surviving trauma. Interventions encompassing the level of community might be therapeutic in two fundamental ways. First, if practitioners embraced ideas from systemic family therapy literature, ideas that acknowledge the importance of social networks, this would encourage a more holistic vision of resilience and recovery. Second, if practitioners recognised that whole communities and social networks might also be traumatised, they could provide support and interventions oriented toward healing at this broader level.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse the neuropathological changes behind clinically defined dementia with Lewy bodies (clinDLB) compared with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (clinAD). Methods The prevalence of neuropathological findings in 48 clinDLB and 45 clinAD cases was compared. Sixteen clinDLB and 10 clinAD cases were reassessed with α-synuclein staining for Lewy bodies (LB). Results Alzheimer pathology was found in 81% of the clinDLB and 93% of the clinAD cases. The clinDLB group had a higher prevalence of frontal white matter pathology, mostly of ischemic type, and a more severe degeneration of the substantia nigra compared with the clinAD group. In hematoxylin?eosin staining, LBs were identified in seven (15%) of the clinDLB and in four (9%) of the clinAD group. In α-synuclein staining, 38% of the clinDLB and 40% of the clinAD cases exhibited LBs. The cases without LBs, in the clinDLB group, had AD pathology in combination with frontal white matter disease. Vascular pathology of significant degree was prevalent in more than 40% of all the cases with verified LBs regardless of clinical diagnosis. Conclusion Consecutive dementia cases, fulfilling the clinical consensus criteria for DLB, may exhibit combinations of neuropathological changes which in themselves can explain the clinical picture of DLB even when LBs are absent.
