AB  - This article is underpinned by the premise that for recovery, healing and post-traumatic growth to occur after traumatic events such as technological and natural disasters, massacres and terrorist attacks, effective therapeutic services need to be offered at both the individual and community level. Frequently, responses to such traumatic instances have been conceptualised as discrete, polarised interventions offered by various groups of health and welfare professionals at various points post the traumatic event. Traditionally when therapeutic interventions are considered, many practitioners assume that the response would, and should, focus primarily and narrowly, on individuals or their families and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Conversely, the perceived role of community wide interventions has been unnecessarily limited to disaster relief or organised emergency responses most usually offered at the time of the crisis. The consequence of these limited understandings is an apparent failure to explore fully the therapeutic or mediating role of social or community support in surviving trauma. Interventions encompassing the level of community might be therapeutic in two fundamental ways. First, if practitioners embraced ideas from systemic family therapy literature, ideas that acknowledge the importance of social networks, this would encourage a more holistic vision of resilience and recovery. Second, if practitioners recognised that whole communities and social networks might also be traumatised, they could provide support and interventions oriented toward healing at this broader level.

AB  - Abstract:? Injuries to the upper cervical spine (UCS) are common in traumatic deaths and postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) may contribute to the forensic investigation. This study presents PMCT in comparison with autopsy in the examination of UCS injury. Thirteen consecutive cases with UCS fracture and/or cranio-cervical dislocation were examined with PMCT and autopsy, and the findings were correlated. Neither of the techniques identified all UCS injuries. Fractures of atlas and axis were best visualized with PMCT whereas cranio-cervical dislocation was better identified during autopsy. Serious injuries were present after both high- and low-energy trauma. Medico-legal autopsy in combination with PMCT produced a thorough evaluation of UCS injuries. By combining these procedures detailed investigations, including accident reconstruction and injury pattern analysis, can be performed. This study supports the routine application of PMCT, as a supplement to the medico-legal autopsy of deaths with UCS injuries.

AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

AB  - Abstract Atherosclerotic vascular disease not only remains the leading cause of death in the Western countries, but it has become the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the low- and middle-income countries as well. Therefore, better understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and its prevention are of fundamental importance. It is well known that it affects sequentially the aorta followed by coronary, carotid, peripheral, and intracerebral arteries, with some individual variability. The mechanisms of progression are similar in each of the beds, with increasing lipid accumulation in the arterial wall along with macrophages and T-cell infiltration, paucity of smooth-muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition, and endothelial-cell dysfunction and hypercoagulability playing an important role at the time of acute manifestations of the disease. Fundamental to this inflammatory process is the presence of classic risk factors, regardless of the involved territory. Therefore, the concept of palliative treatment must be reserved for only those who have progressed beyond preventive measures. Mt Sinai J Med 79:641?653, 2012. ? 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Spanish colonial sites in southern Peru and Bolivia contain remains of native camelids and introduced bovids with examples of degenerative paleopathologies that are interpreted as reflecting changes in herd management, animal use and animal health following the Spanish conquest. The archaeological contexts include three Spanish colonial wineries from Moquegua in southern Peru and the nearby colonial village of Torata Alta where indigenous people were forced to resettle under Spanish control. Also from Peru is faunal material from the 14th to 16th century rural agropastoral village of Pillistay located near Camana. Animal remains with bone abnormalities are also present in residential, commercial and industrial sites associated with Spanish silver mining near Potosí, Bolivia at Tarapaya and Cruz Pampa. Eighteen pathological specimens are described including examples of degenerative changes to phalanges, vertebrae, tarsals, limb elements and ribs. Paleopathologies present include exostoses, osteophytes, porosity, grooving and eburnation. Examples of phalangeal exostoses on bovid phalanges indicate the use of these introduced animals as draught cattle. Exostoses on camelid first phalanges suggests their use as cargo animals as do thoracic vertebrae with severe cases of degenerative pathology. Introduced caprines contain few pathologies indicating their primary use as food animals. The bone abnormalities from colonial sites are more severe than those reported for prehispanic faunal assemblages. These data provide insights into the health and work behaviour of indigenous Andean camelids and introduced Eurasian animals following the Spanish conquest. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990?1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Background Child mental health services and related agencies are faced with an increasing challenge in responding to the influx of refugee children around the world. There is strong evidence on the prevalence and complexity of these children's mental health problems and broader needs. Aims To review the research literature on risk and protective factors, and associated mental health interventions for refugee children. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were included for the period 2004?2017; if they included refugee, asylum-seeking or internally displaced children under 18 years; and adopted a quantitative design. Vulnerability and protective factors for refugee children were considered in this context, followed by the respective types of interventions at pre-, peri- and postmigration stage, and across high- and low-/middle-income countries. Eighty-two peer-reviewed studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Results The existing body of literature is largely based on identifying risk factors among children with mental health problems and predominantly designing trauma-focused interventions to reduce their symptomatic distress. Recent research and services have gradually shifted to a broader and dynamic resilience-building approach based on ecological theory, that is at child, family, school, community and societal level. There is increasing evidence for the implementation and effectiveness of multimodal interventions targeting all these levels, despite the methodological constraints in their evaluation. Conclusions In high-income countries, child mental health services need to collaborate with all agencies in contact with refugee children, establish joint care pathways, and integrate trauma-focused interventions with family and community approaches. In low- and middle-income countries, where specialist resources are sparse, resilience-building should aim at maximising and upskilling existing capacity. A six-dimensional psychosocial model that applies to other children who experience complex trauma is proposed.

AB  - Nonmyeloablative hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recent alternative to myeloablative HSCT in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as a complication of both types of HSCT. Recently the clinical phenomenon of late-onset (>100 days) acute GVHD has been described following nonablative HSCT. However, there has been no relevant description of the histologic features of GVHD in this setting. We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of 28 cases of acute and chronic GVHD following nonablative HSCT at out institution between 2000 and 2003. Our results support the observation of late onset acute GVHD in nonablative HSCT. The mean onset of acute GVHD was 109.8 days (range 8?410 days). Furthermore, we identified a subset of patients (8/23) in the acute GVHD group with composite histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD. This subset was more likely to develop chronic GVHD as compared to patients with only classic acute GVHD, 87.5% versus 25%, respectively (p?<?0.01). Composite histologic features could serve a a predictor of an increased risk for the development of chronic GVHD. These patients may potentially benefit from more aggressive treatment than patients with histologic features of solely acute GVHD.

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - Nine dogs with panniculitis due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were examined over 17 years. Dogs were two to 15 years; five were male, four were female. All were obese or in good condition. Antecedent injury, typically a dog bite or vehicular trauma, could be identified in some patients, while one bitch had hyperadrenocorticism. Infections involved different locations, although the cervicothoracic region, dorsum or flank were most often affected. Patients were systemically well, apart from one dog with pyrexia and two with pain or lameness. Cytology demonstrated pyogranulomatous inflammation, but in only one case was it possible to see acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in smears. Histology demonstrated chronic active pyogranulomatous panniculitis and dermatitis; AFB could be detected in only four specimens. Culture of aspirates or resected tissues demonstrated RGM in all cases, comprising six Mycobacterium smegmatis group and three Mycobacterium fortuitum group isolates. Resection of infected tissues, perioperative injectable antimicrobials and long courses of oral antimicrobials chosen according to susceptibility data generally effected a cure, although some cases recurred.

AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.

AB  - The 12th Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology was held in Comandatuba, Brazil, from August 19?23, 2013, and was preceded by a 2-day Latin American Symposium on Transplant Immunobiology and Immunopathology. The meeting was highlighted by the presentation of the findings of several working groups formed at the 2009 and 2011 Banff meetings to: (1) establish consensus criteria for diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in the presence and absence of detectable C4d deposition; (2) develop consensus definitions and thresholds for glomerulitis (g score) and chronic glomerulopathy (cg score), associated with improved inter-observer agreement and correlation with clinical, molecular and serological data; (3) determine whether isolated lesions of intimal arteritis (?isolated v?) represent acute rejection similar to intimal arteritis in the presence of tubulointerstitial inflammation; (4) compare different methodologies for evaluating interstitial fibrosis and for performing/evaluating implantation biopsies of renal allografts with regard to reproducibility and prediction of subsequent graft function; and (5) define clinically and prognostically significant morphologic criteria for subclassifying polyoma virus nephropathy. The key outcome of the 2013 conference is defining criteria for diagnosis of C4d-negative ABMR and respective modification of the Banff classification. In addition, three new Banff Working Groups were initiated.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Abstract This study presents the excavation and multidisciplinary analysis of seven skeletons recovered in a World War I Mass Grave on the mountains of the Veneto Region, Italy. While it is not a rare phenomenon to these mountainous areas involved in the First Conflict, it is exceptional, on these mountains, to find a mass grave with soldiers in primary burials. Stratigraphic excavation was the mean used for recovery, along with 3D laser scanning documentation. Every skeleton but one was found complete and in anatomical connection. Four soldiers lay in the prone position; two subjects were lying on their side. Identification of the nationality was performed for two of the subjects, who both of whom had personal effects such as a badge for military vaccinations and religious medals. What remained of their uniforms gave clues about their Italian nationality. The entomological analysis conducted on fly puparia discovered close to the bones revealed that the bodies had not been buried immediately. The skeletons were biologically profiled by sex, age, height and ancestry. An accurate study of pathology and stress markers was carried on, as well as on skeletal trauma in order to establish the type of trauma and ammunition involved. The remains belonged altogether to seven Italian male soldiers ages between 18 and 35. Various kinds of stress markers revealed occupational (enthesopathies) and metabolic stress: several signs of cribra cranii and of cribra orbitalia were registered. The study of the injuries revealed a surprising variety of types of lesions, mostly lethal: a few subjects were struck by a shrapnel grenade; one soldier was killed by a grenade explosion. Two of the soldiers were probably executed, instead: this conclusion reached on the basis of gunshot holes (9 mm) in their skulls, and by the position of the injuries.
