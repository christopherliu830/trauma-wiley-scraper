AB  - Abstract Background? Trauma is a leading cause of death and although the gut is recognized as the ?motor? of post-traumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure, studies on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are few. Our objectives were to create a precisely controllable tissue injury model in which GI motility, systemic inflammation and wound fluid can be analyzed. Methods? A non-narcotic murine trauma model was developed by the subcutaneous dorsal trans-implantation of a devitalized donor syngeneic harvested tissue?bone matrix (TBX), which was precisely adjusted to % total body weight and studied after 21?h. Gastrointestinal transit histograms were plotted after the oral administration of non-digestible FITC-dextran and geometric centers calculated. Organ bath evaluated jejunal circular muscle contractility. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence measurements of serum and TBX wound fluid inflammatory mediators were performed. Key Results? Increasing TBX amounts progressively delayed transit, whereas TBX heat denaturation or decellularization prevented ileus and death. In the TBX17.5% model, jejunal muscle contractility was suppressed and a systemic inflammatory response developed as significant serum elevations in IL-6, keratinocyte cytokine and IL-10 compared to sham. In addition, inflammatory responses within the wound fluid showed elevated levels of preformed IL-1? and TNF-α, whereas, 21?h after implantation IL-1?, IL-6 and keratinocyte cytokine were significantly increased in the wound. Conclusions & Inferences? A novel donor tissue?bone matrix trauma model was developed that is precisely adjustable and recapitulates important clinical phenomena. The non-narcotic model demonstrated that increasing tissue injury progressively caused ileus, initiated a systemic inflammatory response and developed inflammatory changes within the wound.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Patient outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly variable. The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

AB  - The first in this series of five papers concerns the evaluation and management of renal injuries. The authors of this paper come from four continents and seven countries, and they reviewed all papers on renal injury published between 1966 and April 2002. The results of the authors? deliberations are present here as a consensus document. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal evaluation and management of renal injuries by review of the world's English-language literature on the subject. METHODS A consensus conference convened by the World Health Organization and the Societé Internationale d?Urologie met to critically review reports of the diagnosis and treatment of renal trauma. The English-language literature about renal trauma was identified using Medline, and additional cited works not detected in the initial search obtained. Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of renal trauma were made with reference to a five-point scale. RESULTS There were many Level 3 and 4 citations, few Level 2, and one Level 1 which supported clinical practice patterns. Findings of nearly 200 reviewed citations are summarized. CONCLUSIONS Published reports on renal trauma still rely heavily on expert opinion and single-institution retrospective case series. Prospective trials of the most significant issues, when possible, might improve the quality of evidence that dictates the behaviour of practitioners.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of the radiological investigations used to investigate suspected abusive head trauma in children. Advice is offered regarding investigations that might reasonably be used in different clinical scenarios. Common misunderstandings, controversies and pitfalls that may arise if radiological findings are misinterpreted are discussed. The forensic significance of these findings is examined, with particular reference to estimates of time of injury and the range of possible explanations for these findings (e.g., the presence of extra-axial fluid around the brain). Forensic practitioners and radiologists are cautioned to avoid over-confidence regarding estimates of time of injury on the basis of fluid densities. Consideration must be given to minimizing confirmatory bias. The authors recommend that radiologists specifically mention in their reports the range of possible explanations for forensically important findings.

AB  - Traumatic injury and its sequelae remain a major, unrecognized public health problem in North America. Traumatic injury is the principal cause of death in patients aged 1-44 years and the overall leading cause of life-years lost in the United States. Recognizing this, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in conjunction with other federal agencies, organized a conference in June 2000 to discuss the basic and clinical research needs that could lead to improved outcomes following cardiopulmonary or post injury resuscitation. The Post Resuscitative and Initial Utility of Life Saving Efforts (PULSE) Workshop resulted and eight work groups were established to focus on various aspects, including organ systems, pharmacology, epidemiology, and trauma. The Trauma Work Group recommendations are presented in this article. Despite the recognition of improved survival and outcome through advancements in trauma systems and trauma care, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support ratio for trauma research is only 0.10, compared with 1.65 for cancer research and a remarkable 3.51 for AIDS and HIV infection research. The successful federal HIV research program has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality over the last ten years at a cost of $1.4 billion per year. A coordinated trauma research program should aim to replicate the success achieved by such programs; however, a centralized federal ?home? for trauma research does not exist. Consequently, the existing limited research support is derived from NIH institutes in addition to other federal and state agencies. This report serves to describe some of the obstacles and outline various strategies and priorities for basic science, clinical, and translational trauma resuscitation research.

AB  - This report describes the epidemiology of pedestrian injury in four inner metropolitan local government areas of Sydney. These data were obtained from the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales. The spectrum of injury and clinical outcome was defined in patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 admitted from the study area, during a 1 year period, to the four inner metropolitan teaching hospitals. The incidence of pedestrian death was 3.3 times the state average of 32/106/year. An average of 235 pedestrians, injured in the study area, were hospitalized each year during the period 1987?89. On average 24 pedestrians died each year, seven at the scene and 17 in hospital. Fifty patients (ISS > 15) were admitted to the four teaching hospitals during a 1 year period 1990?91. Forty-five were adults and five children. Multiplicity of injury was seen in 68% of patients. The pelvis and lower extremities were involved in 70%, the head in 66% and chest in 42%. The hospital mortality rate was 30% with five patients dying on the first day from blood loss and nine dying during subsequent days from head injury. This study has important implications for trauma service development. Successful clinical management of the severely injured pedestrian requires close co-operation between pre-hospital and hospital care providers. An integrated hospital trauma team response is mandatory to ensure appropriate management of what is often a shocked, hypoxic. head-injured patient.

AB  - Summary Viscoelastic assays such as TEG? and ROTEM? are increasingly used to guide transfusion of blood products. The EXTEM assay maximum clot firmness (MCF) is a ROTEM measure available after 25?29 min used to guide early decisions. EXTEM A10, the clot firmness at 10 min, is an accepted early surrogate, but investigators differ on whether A5, the clot firmness at 5 min, is acceptable. We re-examined this in a retrospective observational analysis of 1146 trauma patients in one centre who had ROTEM data recorded. A5 and A10 both correlated well with maximum clot firmness, with Pearson coefficients of r = 0.92 and r = 0.96, respectively. The correlations of A5, A10 and maximum clot firmness with requirement for massive transfusion were all similarly high, with c-stats of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. The correlations with mortality were also similar but weaker, with c-stats of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Using a previously validated cut-off of A5 < 35 mm to predict massive transfusion gave a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 9.3% and negative predictive value 100%. Using a value of A5 < 29 mm, for a pragmatic positive predictive value of 20%, gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity 95% and negative predictive value 99%. Whether aiming for a high sensitivity or a strong predictive value, A5 was non-inferior to A10 and actually missed fewer cases needing massive transfusion. A5 has similar utility to both A10 and maximum clot firmness as an early measure of clot firmness, and a low A5 value is strongly predictive of the need for massive transfusion.

The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.

Subsequent spiral computerised tomography scans of the chest showed anterior pneumothoraces in all cases. In two of the cases anterior pneumothoraces were present in spite of a chest drain having been placed in the pleural cavity. We recommend the insertion of anteriorly positioned chest drains to relieve pneumothoraces in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.
