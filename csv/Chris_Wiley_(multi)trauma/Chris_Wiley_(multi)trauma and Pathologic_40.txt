AB  - To explore the relationships between polyol pathway-related enzymes and pathologic features, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) in the peripheral nerve and kidney tissues collected postmortem from diabetic patients and compared it with those from non-diabetic patients. Tissue AR protein concentrations were also quantified. In non-diabetic patients, AR distributed in pericytes, smooth muscle cells of endo-and epi-neurial microvessels, Schwann cells in the sciatic nerve, and tubular cells of the renal medulla. By contrast, positive SDH reactions were observed in tubular cells of the renal cortex but were faint in the sciatic nerve. Diabetic patients frequently showed dense AR expressions in the sciatic nerve. In nephropathic diabetic patients, the glomerular mesangial area showed diffuse positive reactions for AR. The severity of structural changes in glomeruli correlated with the intensity of immunoreactive AR (r(2)=0.626. P <0.01). AR contents in the renal cortex and sciatic nerve from diabetic patients were 1.5- and 1.8-fold greater than those from non-diabetic patients, respectively (P <0.05 for both). These findings are the first to demonstrate enhanced AR expressions in peripheral nerve and renal glomeruli in diabetic patients and its relevance to the characteristic pathology.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that extracellular ubiquitin has pleiotropic effects on host defence mechanisms, but its cellular mechanism of action is not yet understood. Using fluorescence and in vivo confocal microscopy, we observed uptake of N-terminal fluorescein-labelled ubiquitin into human PBMC and MonoMac 6 cells. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that extracellular ubiquitin is then rapidly conjugated to a multitude of intracellular proteins. LPS and lipoteichoic acid significantly increased uptake and subsequent conjugation to intracellular proteins dose dependently. This mechanism showed saturation kinetics with a K d value for ubiquitin in the low nanomolar range (<10 nmol/L) and a B max value of 0.14?0.27 ?mol ubiquitin/mg protein. These results suggest that the monocytic ubiquitin system can be targeted with physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular ubiquitin during inflammation. This concept could provide a simple explanation for a multitude of extracellular ubiquitin's actions and open up new strategies to influence ubiquitin-dependent intracellular processes.

AB  - This case series describes four cases of concomitant dermoid sinus and spina bifida in a Chinese crested dog, two Swedish vallhunds and a Burmese cat. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography, computed tomography fistulography and pathology. Two dogs that showed abnormalities during neurological examination underwent magnetic resonance imaging. One of them had imaging findings interpreted as syringohydromyelia. All the dogs underwent surgery and the outcome was considered good in all the cases. Based on clinical and pathological examination as well as diagnostic imaging findings, two of the dermoid sinuses were classified as type IV, and two of them showed a previously unreported type of dermoid sinus. This new type is suggested here as type VI.

AB  - Objective: To describe the radiographic appearance of pulmonary oedema in cats with cardiac failure. Methods: Thoracic radiographs of 23 cats presented to a first opinion practice with signs of cardiac failure were reviewed. All cats had tachypnoea and/or dyspnoea and enlarged left atrium on echocardiography. Results: Pulmonary oedema was characterised radiographically by an increased opacity associated with a range of patterns and variable distribution. All cats had evidence of a reticular or granular interstitial pattern. This occurred in combination with alveolar pattern in 19 (83 per cent) cats, including six with air bronchograms, with increased diameter of pulmonary vessels in 16 (71 per cent) cats and with bronchial pattern in 14 (61 per cent) cats. The distribution of pulmonary oedema was considered to be diffuse/non-uniform in 14 (61 per cent) cats, diffuse/uniform in four (17 per cent) cats, multi-focal in four (17 per cent) cats and focal in the remaining one (4 per cent). Nine (39 per cent) cats were considered to have a regional distribution of oedema, including five (22 per cent) with a ventral distribution, three (13 per cent) with a caudal distribution and one (4 per cent) cat with a hilar distribution. The distribution of pulmonary opacities was bilaterally symmetrical in five (22 per cent) cats. Clinical Significance: The variable appearance of feline pulmonary oedema is likely to complicate its radiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: To describe the patterns of enhancement of extradural intervertebral disc on chemically fat saturated gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images and to investigate the clinical and pathological associations with enhancement. Methods: Medical records and magnetic resonance images were reviewed from 30 dogs with histopathologically confirmed disc disease and enhancement on a T1-weighted postcontrast fat saturated sequence. Results: Median duration of neurological signs was 4 days and the most common grade of severity was II, seen in 46·6% of dogs. Homogeneous, heterogeneous and peripheral patterns of disc enhancement were described, with peripheral enhancement most commonly identified (57% of dogs). There were no clinical or pathological differences between the dogs with each of the patterns. The mean signal intensity of a region of interest within the extruded disc material and contrast-to-noise ratio of the disc material were significantly higher on postcontrast T1-weighted fat saturated images (P=<0·0001 each). Clinical Significance: The use of fat saturated gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can detect enhancement of extradural disc material. Patterns of enhancement are not associated with the clinical presentation or pathological features.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Should Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms. Depression and Anxiety, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of a piezoelectric instrument (PI) for bone removal during ventral slot surgery. Study Design Ex vivo feasibility study. Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

AB  - In this study, mapping of ultrashort T2 and T2* of acutely isolated porcine menisci at B0?=?9.4?T was investigated. Maps of T2 were measured from a slice through the pars intermedia with a spin echo-prepared two-dimensional ultrashort-TE T2 mapping technique published previously. T2* mapping was performed by two-dimensional ultrashort-TE MRI with variable acquisition delay. The measured signal decays were fitted by monoexponential, biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fitting functions. The occurrence of Gaussian-like signal decays is outlined theoretically. The quality of the curve fits was visualized by mapping the value δ = abs(1 ? ?2red). For T2* mapping, the Gaussian-exponential fit showed the best performance, whereas the monoexponential and biexponential fits showed regionally high values of δ (δ > 20). Interpretation of the Gaussian-exponential parameter maps was found to be difficult, because a Gaussian signal component can be related to mesoscopic (collagen texture) or macroscopic (slice profile, shim, sample geometry) magnetic field inhomogeneities and/or residual 1H dipole?dipole couplings. It seems likely that an interplay of these effects yielded the observed signal decays. Modulation of the T2* signal decay caused by chemical shift was observed and addressed to fat protons by means of histology. In the T2 measurements, no modulation of the signal decay was observed and the biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fits showed the best performance with comparable values of δ. Our results suggest that T2 mapping provides the more robust method for the characterization of meniscal tissue by means of MRI relaxometry. However, mapping of ultrashort T2, as performed in this study, is time consuming and provides less signal-to-noise ratio per time than the mapping of T2*. If T2* mapping is used, pixel-wise monitoring of the fitting quality based on reduced ?2 should be employed and great care should be taken when interpreting the parameter maps of the fits.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a benign, self-limited, fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation that is diagnostically challenging, often mimicking a malignant process due to its rapid growth clinically and its high cellularity, mitotic activity, and variable/nonspecific cytomorphologic findings. Herein, the authors report what to their knowledge is the largest and first multi-institutional study of the cytomorphologic characteristics of NF by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). METHODS The pathology archives at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, and Emory University Hospital were searched for soft tissue FNA cytology specimens of masses confirmed to be NF. The clinical history, actual FNA diagnosis, and cytomorphologic features were recorded by the authors. RESULTS A total of 34 patients were identified, 33 of which had material available for review. The mean age of the patients was 40 years (range, 1-80 years); 18 patients (52.9%) were male. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.75 months. Four cases (11.8%) and 2 cases (5.9%) were signed out as NF and ?malignant neoplasm, NOS [not otherwise specified],? respectively. On average, cases were hypercellular (mean, 3.27/4). Thirty cases (90.9%) contained spindled morphology, whereas 30 cases (90.9%) and 28 cases (84.4%) contained cells with unipolar and curved cytoplasmic tails, respectively. Eccentric, ovoid, and spindled/elongated nuclei were observed in 31 cases (93.9%), 30 cases (90.9%), and 29 cases (87.9%), respectively. Nineteen cases (57.6%) lacked atypia. CONCLUSIONS In the current study, the diagnosis of NF was suggested in nearly 40% of cases. Combining the clinical presentation with the most commonly described cytomorphologic features will appropriately triage the majority of cases, although uncertainty will remain in a significant number of cases.

AB  - Abstract The Titicaca Basin of Peru and Bolivia has been occupied by humans for millennia and was home to one of the first major state societies in the Andes. Many foundations of state power, however, developed much earlier, during the Late Preceramic/Terminal Archaic Period (3000 ? 1500 BC), when people initially began herding, marking territories, and creating new metallurgy technology. We present a skeletal analysis of 14 individuals dating between 3000 and 1500 BC from Muruqullu, an archaeological site on the Copacabana Peninsula of Bolivia. These are the first Preceramic burials documented for the peninsula and contribute to the relatively small sample of Preceramic bodies from the Andean highlands more broadly. From this sample, we suggest that highland foragers and early herders suffered little nutritional stress and had limited violent interactions, perhaps related to a relatively mobile lifestyle and utilisation of lake resources.

AB  - Objective The role of bacterial infection in the causation of disc degeneration and its consequences is controversial. The current evidence is limited to underpowered studies, with the majority of such studies having only an internal contaminant arm, and only one study having a control arm with a non-degenerate disc population. The Degenerate-disc Infection Study with Contaminant Control (DISC) study includes a control arm and an internal contaminant control to resolve these shortcomings. Methods The study is designed as a case-control study: cases are patients undergoing surgery for degenerated disc pathology and controls are patients undergoing surgery for non-degenerate pathology, such as trauma, scoliosis or tumor cases. Results This study is part of a multi-centric trial involving six spine centers with 15 spine surgeons contributing. The DISC study methodology, rationale and controversies are presented here. The predominant issue is how to interpret contamination. We present our algorithm for the DISC study to address this. For disc samples that are positive concurrently with positive paraspinal tissue sample, the result will be interpreted as contamination. For positive disc samples with a negative paraspinal tissue culture result, the interpretation of this result will be infection. If cultures for both disc sample and paraspinal tissue sample are negative, then the result is interpreted as non-infected. If the disc culture is negative but paraspinal tissue culture is positive, then it is treated as a contaminant. Conclusions Future large-scale studies are required with a good control arm, a contamination arm, and histopathological correlations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The regrowth of amputated appendage extremities and the distal tips of digits represent models of tissue regeneration in multiple vertebrate taxa. In humans, digit tip injuries, including traumatic amputation and crush injuries, are among the most common type of injury to the human hand. Despite clinical reports demonstrating natural regeneration of appendages in lower vertebrates and human digits, current treatment options are suboptimal, and are complicated by the anatomical complexities and functions of the different tissues within the digits. Results: In light of these challenges, we focus on recent advancements in understanding appendage regeneration from model organisms. We pay special attention to the cellular programs underlying appendage regeneration, where cumulative data from salamanders, fish, frogs, and mice indicate that regeneration occurs by the actions of lineage-restricted precursors. We focus on pathologic states and the interdependency that exists, in both humans and animal models, between the nail organ and the peripheral nerves for successful regeneration. Conclusions: The increased understanding of regeneration in animal models may open new opportunities for basic and translational research aimed at understanding the mechanisms that support limb regeneration, as well as amelioration of limb abnormalities and pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Background A descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the characteristics of workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China can contribute to a scientific basis for the prevention and control of such fatal incidents as well for as the facilitation of medical assistance during these episodes. Methods We used data on workplace-based multiple fatality incidents spanning January 1, 2001?December 31, 2008 as collected by the National Work Safety Administration of China to analyze event frequency, type, number of deaths, mortality rate (per million persons), and regional distribution. Results A total of 17,277 workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were reported between 2001 and 2008, which were associated with 62,850 deaths and 30,418 injuries. The most common types or settings associated with workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were road traffic accidents (>3 deaths only; total 23,464 deaths), coal mine explosions (23,418 deaths), and incidents involving shipping (3,978 deaths). Conclusion The risk for workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China is one of the highest in the world. Prevention is critical and should be strengthened. Our results may provide useful information help to improve prevention and control measures. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54:560?564, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Conjunctival melanoma is an uncommon malignancy with the potential for significant morbidity. Ulceration is known to be an indicator of more aggressive cutaneous melanoma. This factor has not been previously evaluated in conjunctival melanoma. Methods: Twenty-six patients with conjunctival melanoma who underwent excision by a single surgeon at a cancer referral center treated between June 2003 and July 2008 were included. The medical records were reviewed for clinical and pathological data. Outcomes assessed included local recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, use of adjuvant topical chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation therapy, final visual acuity and death. Results: Local recurrence was seen in three patients (12%). Regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis were each seen in four patients (15%). Tumors >2.0 mm thick were more likely to develop distant metastasis than those with a thickness of <2.0 mm (p = 0.0331). Ulceration was noted in 10 of 26 patients. Regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis were each seen in 4 of 10 patients with ulceration, and none of the patients without ulceration. Conclusions: Ulceration in conjunctival melanoma may be an important histopathologic predictor of a more aggressive tumor. Globe-sparing multi-modality management of conjunctival melanoma can yield acceptable rates of local?regional recurrence. Savar A, Esmaeli B, Ho H, Liu S, Prieto VG.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of subclinical abnormalities reported in thoracic (CT) scans of cats and to investigate associations between respiratory signs and CT signs. METHODS Retrospective review of signalment, indications, respiratory signs and reported CT findings in a series of cats. Associations between patient variables, respiratory signs and CT signs were analysed using multi-variable regression methods. RESULTS Records of 352 consecutive cats were reviewed. Abnormalities affecting thoracic structures were reported in CT scans of 138/179 (77%) cats that did not have respiratory signs; the most prevalent CT findings were pulmonary collapse (41%), evidence of bronchial disease (24%) and space-occupying lesions (21%). Dyspnoea, cough and tachypnoea were associated with space-occupying lesions. Dyspnoea was also associated with pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. Increasing body weight was associated with pulmonary atelectasis and increasing age was associated with evidence of bronchial disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Abnormalities were commonly detected in thoracic CT scans of cats that did not show respiratory signs. The most prevalent abnormality ? pulmonary atelectasis ? is probably a temporary effect of sedation or anaesthesia. A high prevalence of subclinical abnormalities and limited correlations between clinical signs and CT findings will complicate diagnosis.

AB  - A multi-institutional study ?Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth? (PDAY) was initiated to document the natural history of atherosclerosis, its relationship to risk factors, and pathobiology of lesion development in young subjects. Pathology laboratories in nine centers collected arteries and tissues from over 2000 persons from 15 through 34 years of age whose deaths were attributed to homicides, accidents, or suicides. Arteries were evaluated for lesions, and risk factors were analyzed in a central laboratory. Postmortem risk factors included serum lipoproteins, serum thio-cyanate (smoking), glycohemoglobin (diabetes), thickness of panniculus adiposus (obesity), small renal artery changes (hypertension) and apoprotein isoforms. This study documents the development of atherosclerosis at an early age. It also shows that the recognized risk factors for coronary heart disease are associated with lesion development in the arteries of these young subjects. The PDAY study has a counterpart in Japan where the development of atherosclerosis has been studied in young subjects. This Japanese study, in a population in which coronary heart disease has not yet become a major epidemic, has findings quite similar to the findings from the PDAY study. Studies of atherosclerosis in both Japan and the USA provide strong justification for reducing risk factors in young persons.

AB  - Summary Local and regional anesthetic techniques are gaining widespread acceptance in the management of pain in small and large animals. They penetrate peripheral nerves and induce reversible blockade of impulse conduction in myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. The local anesthetics block the conduction of nerve impulses by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes. Administration of an incorrect dose and inadvertent intravenous administration of the local anesthetics are probably the most common causes of systemic toxicity. Local anesthetics can also be given systemically to manage perioperative pain and ileus. They are often used in combination with other classes of analgesic drugs as part of a multi-modal pain management strategy. The local anesthetics have the unique ability to produce complete blockade of peripheral nociceptive input, preventing the development of pathological pain as well as the stress response.
