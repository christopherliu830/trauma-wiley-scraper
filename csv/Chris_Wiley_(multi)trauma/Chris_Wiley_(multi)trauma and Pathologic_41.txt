AB  - Although ?insignificant? prostate cancer has been examined separately in radical prostatectomy (RP) and radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) studies, it is not entirely clear whether cancers designated as ?insignificant? on RP and RCP represent the same, similar or different forms of prostate cancer. Insignificant prostate cancer has been traditionally defined based on the pathological findings in the whole prostate gland. In addition to the pathological determinants of ?insignificant? prostate cancer, it is also important to account for the biological and the clinical context of the disease, as well as patient age and health status to designate a prostate cancer ?insignificant?. This review examines and compares prostate cancers described as ?insignificant? on RP and RCP. We conclude that in most cases these low-volume/low-grade prostate cancers represent an early stage and clinically ?silent? disease, which are only detected in different clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract Background General practitioners' (GP) views about orthopaedic clinical assessment services (OCAS) managed by physiotherapists in the NHS have seldom been sought, yet GPs are likely to be key referrers to such a service. Aim This study aims to review GP views about an OCAS and how they believed the service could be improved. Design of the Study Fifteen consenting GPs were interviewed utilizing semi-structured interviews and a standardized topic guide. Method Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed for emergent themes. Interviews were analysed sequentially by date performed until saturation. Themes were discussed, and disagreements evaluated until agreement was found between the two main authors. The third author then analysed randomly selected interview transcripts and found no additional themes. Results The study found GPs refer to specialist services, including this OCAS, because of wait times, locality, patient experience, GP experience and knowledge of available services. No GP identified they knew all possible orthopaedic referral routes. Conclusion GPs saw OCAS as another referral choice for patients suffering orthopaedic pathologies. GPs identified some difficulty in understanding the different services including the various professional roles involved. To assist with their understanding, they described requesting advertising of the different services and the clinicians involved or streamlining of services by provider services. Further detailed research addressing the limitations in this research design is indicated to investigate GP's thoughts and behaviours in relation to referral patterns especially as GPs in the UK took on commissioning for services from April 2013.

AB  - Abstract Preparation of thin serial sections for comparative macromorphologic investigations has always represented a grave technical problem, especially in the case of regions in which bone as well as soft tissue are to be documented within their natural relations to each other in any desired sectional plane. Non-decalcified specimens up to the size of a whole cadaver are embedded in physiologic medium, precisely positioned, and deep-frozen to a specimen-ice block. A newly developed device, working on the basis of blades rotating at high speed, allows quick, successive removal of sections from the surface of the specimen block, with a thickness of each section infinitely variable between 0.1 and 5 mm. Following each cut, the new surface of the block can be documented photographically or on videotape for macromorphologic evaluation. So far more than 1,000 human, animal, and botanical specimens have been sectioned and evaluated with this method. In none of the cases were specimens damaged. Furthermore, any desired sectional plane could be adjusted; consequently a definite correlation between these sections and previous sonography, magnetic resonance (MR), or computed tomography (CT) images could be established. As serial cryosectioning becomes available to a far wider circle of medical and natural scientists, high-quality results should be obtained at lower costs. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose? The comprehensive describtion of the epidemiology of pelvic ring fractures (PRF) including high-energy PRF, low-energy PRF and those who die during the prehospital phase (pre-H). Methods? 12-month prospective population based study was performed in a trauma system with one Level-1 trauma centre and seven referring hospitals (population: 0.6 million). Data were collected on all PRF from the trauma system including high-energy, low energy fractures and pre-H deaths with PRF. Patient demographics, injury severity score (ISS), mortality (%) and PRF-related mortality were recorded prospectively. All high-energy deaths had autopsy at the same forensic pathology department. Data presented as percentages (%) or mean +/? SEM. Results? During the 12-month period 138 patients suffered PRF (45% male, 59+/?2 years, ISS 20+/?2, 21% mortality and 8% PRF-related mortality). Sixty-four % of the low-energy and 92% of the high-energy patients were transferred directly to the trauma center. There were 57 high-energy (71% male, 41+/?3 years, ISS 23+/?3, 14% mortality, 7% PRF-related mortality) 63 low-energy (20% male, 81+/?1 years, ISS 6+/?1, 5% mortality, 2% PRF-related mortality) and 18 pre-H died patients with PRF (47% male, 41+/?6 years, ISS 61+/?4, 100% mortality, 33% PRF-related mortality). PRF-related mortality was always due to bleeding. Conclusions? The majority of PRF-related mortality occurs pre-H. Half of the multiple-injured high-energy PRF patients still die because of the pelvic bleeding. Further preventive measures and optimization of the care of PRF patients is required. Trauma centre admission of 2/3 of the low-energy PRF is a significant load and should be further investigated in an inclusive trauma system.

AB  - ABSTRACT Myeloproliferative disorders involving the megakaryocytic line are uncommon but in recent years several reports have come from North America and the United Kingdom describing megakaryoblastic leukaemia (MbL) and a particular form called essential thrombocythaemia (ET). This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - Summary Denture stomatitis has been reported in 11?67% of complete denture wearers. It is more common on the palatal mucosa and in female patients. In Newton's type I denture stomatitis, where the inflammation remains focal, trauma seems to be responsible. In Newton's types II and III denture stomatitis, where the denture-bearing mucosa is diffusely involved, most workers assert that the aetiology is multi-factorial. Evidence is presented incriminating Candida albicans colonization of the fitting surface of the prosthesis in many cases of denture stomatitis promoted by continuous denture wearing. Allergic and primary irritant reactions to the denture base material, systemic predisposing factors including dietary deficiency and haematological disorders, also play a part. In most cases of denture stomatitis, elimination of denture faults, control of denture plaque and discontinuous denture wearing are sufficient treatment. The routine use of antiseptic or antimycotic drugs seems unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - In accordance with recent terminology, it is proposed that malignant mesenchymoma should be renamed ?composite sarcoma? and defined as ?a sarcoma composed of two or more cellular types each of which is sufficiently differentiated to permit clear recognition of its histogenetic type microscopically, immunohistochemically or ultrastructurally; excluding fibrosarcomatous and high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomatous component, dedifferentiated sarcoma and the combination of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma which is regarded as a single histogenetic type?. Four cases of primary osseous composite sarcoma (POCS) were identified among 928 primary bone sarcomas. Their age ranged from 10 to 87 years, peak incidence in the second decade with equal sex distribution. Most presented with pain, commonest in the knee, affecting the metaphysis, appearing radiologically as expansile infiltrative osteolytic lesions with cortical erosion, periosteal reaction, variable extent of osteoblastic areas and soft tissue extension. All contained variable amounts of conventional high-grade osteosarcoma with or without chondrosarcoma component; the other constituents were liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. In all cases, Ki67 proliferative index was over 35%, there was no CDK4 and MDM2 amplification. The absence of low-grade component supported the de novo origin of POCS rather than derivation from divergent dedifferentiation. The two older patients with hitherto undescribed osteoleiomyosarcoma died 2 and 10 months after operation, whereas the two younger with osteorhabdomyosarcoma and osteoliposarcoma enjoyed disease-free survival at 16 and 6 years after chemotherapy despite the latter showing lung metastasis at presentation. Identification of the different lines of differentiation together with their approximate amounts and histological grades is therefore mandatory for POCS as multi-agent chemotherapy catered for each sarcoma component might offer hope for long-term disease-free survival.

AB  - Abstract Polycomb group protein EZH2 and Bmi1 are reportedly involved in the progression of malignant tumours. We examined the participation of EZH2 in multi-step cholangiocarcinogenesis in hepatolithiasis with respect to tumour suppressor gene p16INK4a. We examined 20 hepatolithiatic livers with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and 10 histologically normal livers. Neoplastic biliary lesions were classified into biliary intraepithelial neoplasm (BilIN-1, 2 and 3) and invasive carcinoma. We selected 15 foci of invasive carcinoma, 8 BilIN-3 (carcinoma in situ), 12 BilIN-2 (high-grade dysplasia), 32 BilIN-1 (low-grade dysplasia) and 37 non-neoplastic biliary epithelia from these livers. Expression of p16INK4a, EZH2 and Bmi1 were surveyed in these foci. P16INK4a promoter methylation was examined in microdissected tissues. Taking advantage of two cell lines of CC (HuCTT-1 and TFK-1) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), the effects of the knockdown of EZH2 on p16INK4a methylation of CC cells were examined. Expression of p16INK4a, which was frequent in BilIN1, was decreased in BilIN-2/3 and invasive carcinoma, while EZH2 expression showed step-wise increase from BilIN-1, -2 and -3 to invasive carcinoma (p < 0.01). P16INK4a promoter hypermethylation was related to aberrant expression of EZH2. The knockdown of EZH2 in cultured CC cells decreased p16INK4a methylation and decreased binding of EZH2 to the p16INK4a gene promoter. The latter suggested that direct binding of EZH2 is involved in the regulation of the p16INK4a gene. Our data suggest that over-expression of EZH2 may induce hypermethylation of p16INK4a promoter followed by decreased expression of p16INK4a in the multi-step cholangiocarcinogenesis through intraepithelial neoplasm in hepatolithiasis.

AB  - Abstract Significant progress has been made toward improving both the acquisition of clinical diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data and its analysis in the uninjured brain, through various techniques including a large number of model-based solutions that have been proposed to fit for multiple tissue compartments, and multiple fibers per voxel. While some of these techniques have been applied to clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) research, the majority of these technological enhancements have yet to be fully implemented in the preclinical arena of TBI animal model-based research. In this review, we describe the requirement for preclinical, MRI-based efforts to provide systematic confirmation of the applicability of some of these models as indicators of tissue pathology within the injured brain. We review how current DWI techniques are currently being used in animal TBI models, and describe how both acquisition and analytic techniques could be extended to leverage the progress made in clinical work. Finally, we highlight remaining gaps in the preclinical pipeline from data acquisition to final analysis that currently have no real, preclinical-based correlate.

AB  - Objective In this trial, we compared the relative efficacy of dialogical exposure group treatment using Gestalt empty-chair method with a supportive group in the treatment of symptoms stemming from traumatic loss in a post-war society. Methods One-hundred and nineteen women whose husbands were either killed or registered as missing during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were quasi-randomized to seven sessions of group treatment with dialogical exposure or to an active control condition. Results Both interventions resulted in significant improvement from baseline to post-treatment for both kinds of loss, in terms of post-traumatic symptoms, general mental health and grief reactions, with the exception of depression and traumatic grief in the control condition. Regarding mean effect sizes (Cohen's d), pre-treatment to post-treatment improvements were moderate (d?=?0.56) for the dialogical exposure group and small (d?=?0.34) for the supportive group. Treatment gains were maintained at least until the 1-year follow-up. In controlled comparisons, dialogical exposure was superior concerning traumatic grief (Cohen's d?=?0.37) and post-traumatic avoidance (d?=?0.73) at post-treatment. Conclusions Results show that short-term dialogical exposure group treatment was moderately effective in treating traumatically bereaved women. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.

AB  - The amount of myelin in the outer band of Baillarger in the human visual cortex stained by Luxol Fast Blue MBS, has been measured in normal individuals of wide age range, in a group of blind and severely visually impaired but otherwise normal individuals and in a series of demented patients of the Alzheimer and multi-infarct type who were apparently visually normal. The amount of myelin is found to be significantly reduced in the blind and demented groups. Examination of the lateral geniculate body in the blind cases demonstrated slight reduction in neuron numbers and marked reduction in mean neuron diameter. Neuronal cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid, nucleolar volume and numbers of tetraploid glial nuclei in the blind or visually impaired cases were significantly reduced when compared with controls, indicating reduced function in these neurons. Similar results were obtained on examining this nucleus in Alzheimer and multi-infarct cases, suggesting that the visual pathways may be involved in these conditions. It is concluded that loss of myelin from the outer band of Baillarger occurs in association with reduced function of neurons in the lateral geniculate body.

AB  - Objective The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral lesions of autoimmune etiology (OLAIE) in a cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Materials and methods A multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at the oral medicine practices of Carolinas Medical Center (CMC), Baylor College of Dentistry (BCD), and the University of Florida (UF). Each site performed a chart review of patients with well-characterized pSS. Clinical variables such as OLAIE, traumatic lesions, and medical conditions were compiled at each site. The association between clinical variables and the presence of OLAIE was then assessed for significance. Results We evaluated 155 patients diagnosed with pSS. Nineteen patients with pSS (12.3%) had an OLAIE. CMC reported 11 (21.2%) patients with OLAIE, while BCD and UF reported 4 (7.3%) and 4 (8.3%), respectively. Eleven of the 19 (58%) patients with OLAIE had lichen planus, 6 (32%) had aphthous stomatitis, 1 (5%) had chronic ulcerative stomatitis, and 1 (5%) had lesions of systemic connective tissue disease by immunofluorescence. Conclusion The results of our analysis suggest that patients with pSS have a 12% prevalence of OLAIE with a wide range (7.3?21.2%) found between practices. This difference is likely related to the different screening protocols for oral dryness between sites.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: To describe the clinical entity and therapeutic challenges of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ). The use of vascularized bone grafts for reconstruction of the mandible in extensive BRONJ is proposed. Study Design: Multi-institutional retrospective review. Methods: Patients undergoing mandible reconstruction with vascularized bone grafts after segmental mandible resection for BRONJ were evaluated. Mandible reconstruction was only performed on patients with intractable pain, fistulae, or pathologic fracture and after failure of comprehensive conservative therapy. No patients had a history of primary or metastatic head and neck malignancy or radiation therapy. Bone union was established with follow-up radiography. Results: Eleven patients met inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 61.3 years. Median follow-up was 13.9 months. All patients had undergone therapy with bisphosphonates and had no other identifiable cause of mandible osteonecrosis. Preoperatively, pathologic mandible fractures were present in 73% of patients, and 36% had orocutaneous fistulae. Fibula osteocutaneous flaps were used in all cases with no failures. In all patients, bony union was demonstrated clinically and radiographically. Postoperative wound complications occurred in 36% of patients but were all treated successfully with conservative therapy. There was no BRONJ recurrence within the study follow-up period. Conclusions: Osteonecrosis is a significant complication of bisphosphonate therapy, and current literature does not support vascularized reconstruction. We demonstrate that vascularized bone graft reconstruction with the fibula free flap offers a high success rate of bony union and fistula closure and should be offered to selected patients with advanced cases of BRONJ.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on some of the common children's musculoskeletal conditions that the nurse/practitioner may come across in everyday working practice. An in-depth evidence-based overview of the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of developmental dysplasia of the hip, Legg Calve Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis and congenital talipes equinovarus provides the practitioner with knowledge and guidance in the care of the child with these conditions. In addition the musculoskeletal assessment of children is discussed along with the orthopaedic implications of vitamin D deficiency and amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Alexander Disease (AxD) is a degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the GFAP gene, which encodes the major intermediate filament of astrocytes. As other cells in the CNS do not express GFAP, AxD is a primary astrocyte disease. Astrocytes acquire a large number of pathological features, including changes in morphology, the loss or diminution of a number of critical astrocyte functions and the activation of cell stress and inflammatory pathways. AxD is also characterized by white matter degeneration, a pathology that has led it to be included in the ?leukodystrophies.? Furthermore, variable degrees of neuronal loss take place. Thus, the astrocyte pathology triggers alterations in other cell types. Here, we will review the neuropathology of AxD and discuss how a disease of astrocytes can lead to severe pathologies in non-astrocytic cells. Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of AxD will also lead to a better understanding of how astrocytes interact with other CNS cells and how astrocytes in the gliosis that accompanies many neurological disorders can damage the function and survival of other cells.
