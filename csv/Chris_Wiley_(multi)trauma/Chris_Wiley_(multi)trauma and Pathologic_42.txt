AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Contrary to prevailing medical belief, dementia is generally not caused by arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels. There may be, in fact, as many as 50 different causes. While the two major types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, are irreversible, perhaps 20 per cent of dementias are secondary to treatable causes, and are reversible. The most important of these is the pseudodementia of depression, which can be easily missed without a high degree of suspicion. Tips on the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and pseudodementia are discussed, as are other causes of dementia secondary to various diseases or therapy.

AB  - Objective The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral lesions of autoimmune etiology (OLAIE) in a cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Materials and methods A multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at the oral medicine practices of Carolinas Medical Center (CMC), Baylor College of Dentistry (BCD), and the University of Florida (UF). Each site performed a chart review of patients with well-characterized pSS. Clinical variables such as OLAIE, traumatic lesions, and medical conditions were compiled at each site. The association between clinical variables and the presence of OLAIE was then assessed for significance. Results We evaluated 155 patients diagnosed with pSS. Nineteen patients with pSS (12.3%) had an OLAIE. CMC reported 11 (21.2%) patients with OLAIE, while BCD and UF reported 4 (7.3%) and 4 (8.3%), respectively. Eleven of the 19 (58%) patients with OLAIE had lichen planus, 6 (32%) had aphthous stomatitis, 1 (5%) had chronic ulcerative stomatitis, and 1 (5%) had lesions of systemic connective tissue disease by immunofluorescence. Conclusion The results of our analysis suggest that patients with pSS have a 12% prevalence of OLAIE with a wide range (7.3?21.2%) found between practices. This difference is likely related to the different screening protocols for oral dryness between sites.

AB  - Abstract We have previously described a duodenojejunal bypass (DJB) surgical model in healthy C57BL/6 mice. However, our pilot study showed that the same surgical technique caused a high mortality rate in obese mice. In this study, to significantly improve animal survival rate following bariatric surgery and thereby providing a stable surgical model for the study of glucose homeostasis in obese mice, we have used modified techniques and developed the end-to-side gastrojejunal bypass (GJB) surgery in obese C57BL/6 with impaired glucose tolerance. The modification consisted of using the distal part of the jejunum for biliopancreatic diversion including: 1) ligation of the distal stomach at the level of the pylorus; 2) connection the jejunum to the anterior wall of stomach in an end-to-side fashion; and 3) diverting the biliopancreatic secretions through the blind limb into the distal jejunum through an end-to-side anastomosis. We found that by modifying the proximal end-to-end duodenojejunal anastomosis, described in our original model, to an end-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis in these obese mice, we were able to significantly improve the postoperative mortality in this study. We have also demonstrated that performing the GJB surgery in obese mice resulted in significant weight loss, normalized blood glucose levels, and prevented acute pancreatitis. This newly developed GJB surgery in the obese mice offers a unique advantage to study the mechanisms of gastrointestinal surgery as treatment for type 2 diabetes. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Inflammation of the small intestine is common worldwide. Infections are the major cause whereas chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CIBD), drugs and other conditions are less frequent causes. Worldwide, enteric infections rank third among all causes of disease burden. The main infectious agents include a variety of viruses and bacterial agents. As endoscopy is used more frequently, the pathologist is more likely to see small intestinal biopsies for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions, although histology most often does not contribute much to the specific diagnosis of infections. Histology is, however, very important in chronic conditions, allowing the identification of pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, and the differential diagnosis between CIBD and drug- or infection-related conditions, such as tuberculosis, based on the morphology of the lesions. Histological analysis is equally important for the diagnosis of inflammation in patients with a disturbed immune system, such as transplant recipients and for the identification of rare diseases.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) uses x-ray beams and reconstructive computer technology to create tomographic slices (sections) of the area being imaged. Computed tomography has higher contrast resolution than conventional radiography allowing for more accurate differentiation of soft tissues and fluids. This form of 3D imaging removes problems caused by superimposition of multiple anatomical structures, which is a major impediment when viewing radiographs of the equine head. Once the images are acquired, multi-planar and 3D reconstructions can be performed to view different teeth or associated structures in an optimal way. Anatomical and pathological changes in the dental tissues, periodontal tissues, alveolar bone and adjacent sinuses can then be assessed. Scintigraphy with 99m technetium methyl-diphosphate (methylene-diphosphonate) can detect changes in bone that precede radiographic changes, and this makes it a very useful imaging modality for diagnosis of early periapical infection of the equine cheek teeth. Additionally, it is invaluable for imaging suspected infections of supernumerary or dysplastic teeth where the results of radiography or even CT may be equivocal. Periapical infections of the cheek teeth typically result in focal and intense increased radionuclide uptake located over the apical region of the affected tooth.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge Fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, underlying etiologies, treatment, and outcome associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in cats; and to identify clinical feature differences among cats with asthma associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (AASSP) versus nonasthma-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (NAASSP). Design Retrospective case series. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Sixteen client-owned cats with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Domestic short hair was the predominant breed in this study (n = 15). The median age was 8 years old (range: 7 weeks to 17 years) with no sex predilection. Fourteen cats were affected by multi-lobar pulmonary pathology of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes. Asthma was the most common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax (25%). Ten of 12 treated cats survived the initial episode of spontaneous pneumothorax to discharge with medical management, including all 4 cats with AASSP. Reoccurrence was documented in 4 cats. Pulmonary lobectomy was curative for 1 cat with congenital accessory lung lobe emphysema. No difference in clinical presentation was identified between cats with AASSP and cats with NAASSP. Conclusions Feline SSP is frequently associated with extensive pulmonary pathology. Supportive medical management is most appropriate, except in rare cases with focal congenital abnormalities that may benefit from surgical intervention. AASSP appears to carry a good prognosis for short-term outcome (survival to discharge). Clinical assessment, imaging, and invasive diagnostics were required to differentiate between AASSP and NAASSP.

AB  - Abstract. The ECG is a 12-lead-vector system and is known to contain redundant information. Factor analysis (PA) is a statistical technique that improves measured data and eliminates redundancy by identifying a minimum number of factors accounting for variance in the data set. Objective: To identify the minimum number of lead-vectors required to predict the 12-lead ECG. Methods: A total of 104 ECGs were obtained from 24 normal men, 22 normal women, and 28 men and 30 women with variable pathologies. Each ECG lead was simultaneously acquired and digitized, resulting in a voltage-time data array stored for mathematical analysis. Each array was factor-analyzed to identify the minimum number of lead-vectors spanning the ECG data space. The 12-lead ECG was then predicted from this minimum lead-vector set. ANOVA was used to test for statistical significance between normal and pathologic data groups. Results: FA revealed that 3 lead-vectors accounted for 99.12%± 0.92% (95% CI ± 0.18%) of the variance contained in the 12-lead ECG voltage-time data for all 104 cases. There were no statistically significant differences between men and women (99.25%± 0.66% vs 98.98 ± 1.11%; p = 0.139). Statistically significant differences were noted between normal and acute myocardial infarction ECGs (99.5%± 0.27% vs 98.66 ± 1.25%; p = 0.00003). The measured and predicted leads were almost identical. A 3-dimensional spatial ECG derived from the 3-lead-vector set resulted in variable curved surfaces that differed by pathology. Conclusions: The 12-lead ECG can be derived from only 3 measured leads and graphed as a 3-D spatial ECG. This type of data processing may lead to instantaneous acquisition and may enhance the diagnostic capability of the ECG from routine bedside telemetry equipment.

AB  - Summary The ability of the eyes to fixate on a single object in space is a highly coordinated action that relies upon functional extraocular muscles, cranial nerves, and input from the higher centers. Eye alignment also contributes to visual acuity and binocular vision. Abnormal eye alignment, meaning that one or both eyes deviate from the expected visual axis, is called strabismus. Strabismus may be present at all times, in all body positions, or it may be positional. Strabismus also varies between patients in terms of severity and based upon the direction in which the globe(s) is/are deviating. Globes may deviate inward or outward, upward or downwards. Strabismus may also be rotational. An understanding of the anatomy of extraocular muscles and their innervation facilitates lesion localization. Lesions within the middle and inner ear, cerebellum, and vestibular centers can also result in strabismus. The goal of this chapter is to review the most common causes of strabismus in the dog and cat, and from where in the body they originate.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Essentially, all VCA recipients have experienced episodes of rejection. At the time this chapter was written, acute rejection episodes have been observed in up to 85% of VCA recipients within the first year. Due to the infrequent application of VCA, no single group has accumulated sufficient experience to determine histologic patterns of rejection. As such, this chapters focuses on the histopathological aspects of graft rejection within the context of the early stage of VCA development. We also provide a historic perspective of the study of VCA histopathology primed by the Banff Working Group, and considerations on non-alloimmune pathology.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum is site to a wide spectrum of tumours and tumour-like conditions. The nomenclature of many of these conditions has evolved over recent years and there persists many morphological and immunophenotypical similarities between these tumours and non-neoplastic lesions. Primary tumours of the peritoneum are regarded as those with primary peritoneal manifestation in the absence of a visceral origin. They may be classified according to their probable histogenetic cell of origin: mesothelial, sub-mesothelial mesenchymal and uncertain (uncommitted stem cells). Accurate diagnosis is important for clinical prognostic and therapeutic reasons and, for malignant mesothelioma, for medicolegal reasons. The most common tumours to involve the peritoneal tissues are secondary tumours, especially carcinomatosis from primary gastrointestinal tract or ovarian neoplasms. Tumour-like lesions arising in the peritoneum encompass a variety of cysts of the omentum and mesentery, and pseudo-tumours as well as diverse metaplastic conditions. In this chapter there is a review of the various conditions, with emphasis on the diagnostic features and role of ancillary investigations that may be of value in discriminating between different lesions.

AB  - Summary Inflammation of the intestines is common worldwide. Infections are the major cause whereas chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CIBDs), drugs and other conditions are less frequent causes. Worldwide, enteric infections rank third among all causes of disease burden. The main infectious agents include a variety of viruses and bacterial agents. As endoscopy and colonoscopy are used more frequently, the pathologist is more likely to see small and large intestinal biopsies for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions, although histology most frequently does not contribute very much to the specific diagnosis of infections. Histology is, however, very important in chronic conditions, allowing the identification of pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, and the differential diagnosis between CIBD and drug- or infection-related conditions, such as tuberculosis and acute infectious colitis, based on the morphology of the lesions. Histological analysis is equally important for the diagnosis of inflammation in patients with a disturbed immune system, such as transplant recipients, and for the identification of rare diseases, and the diagnosis of dysplasia and complicating neoplasias.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study assessed the outcomes of patients with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) that ruptured before or during resection. Methods: The records of 23 patients (8 women, 15 men; median age 54 years) with ruptured primary non-metastatic GIST were retrieved from a database of 554 patients. The written surgical and pathology reports were analysed. Review pathology was performed in all 23 cases, and mutational analysis of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor α (PDGFRA) genes was performed in 21 patients. Median follow-up was 52 months. Results: Tumour rupture was spontaneous in 16 patients, following abdominal trauma in two and occurred during resection in five. Primary tumour location was the stomach in six patients, duodenum in one and small bowel in 16. Mean tumour size was 10·2 (range 4?28) cm. According to the Miettinen and Lasota risk classification, the distribution of very low-, low-, intermediate- and high-risk cases was one, two, five and 15 respectively. One patient remained disease-free at 83 months. Fifteen of 16 patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy developed tumour recurrence after a median of 19 months. Median recurrence-free survival in patients with KIT mutations involving codons 557?558 was 11 months. Conclusion: Patients with a rupture of GIST into the abdominal cavity have a risk of recurrence of nearly 100 per cent. In patients with deletion mutations involving codons 557?558, recurrence-free survival was less than 1 year. All patient groups are clear candidates for adjuvant drug therapy.

AB  - Summary Several pathological conditions can occur that directly impact the male external genitalia. These conditions may be congenital or acquired, and have implications for the patient's ability to breed. Hypospadias, a condition in which the urethra develops abnormally during fetal life, is one of the most common canine congenital anomalies. Although hypospadias may also affect females, the penile urethra is more often the target. Other conditions that may present to clinical practice include paraphimosis and priapism. The former involves a flaccid penis that cannot be replaced within the prepuce, whereas a penis that maintains erection without sexual stimulation characterizes the latter. In both cases, the affected penis is exposed for long periods of time. This protracted exposure causes the tissue to desiccate. The affected penile tissue also becomes increasingly irritated and/or edematous. If local circulation is compromised, the penis may become necrotic. In such extreme cases, phallectomy is indicated. This chapter emphasizes the approach to hypospadias, paraphimosis, priapism, and traumatic injury to the penis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an elevated risk of post-operative complications. The impact it has on patients living with DM following hip fracture surgery (HFS) is not completely understood and may represent a predictor of increased mortality. This study investigates the impact of DM, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and fracture location, on the outcome of HFS in Ireland. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database records all fragility hip fractures within Galway University Hospital. Retrospective data collection was performed over a 3-year period. Data collected included patient age, gender, date of HFS, anatomical fracture location, type of operation, ASA grade, DM status, and mortality. A database of 650 individuals was created including 461 females and 189 males, with an average group age of 80.2?±?9.3 years. Results showed a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in males with DM (19.57%) than females with DM (12.36%) (?2 test, p?=?0.020). Cox regression survival analysis indicated that DM status and ASA grade were the two main independent predictors of patient survival following HFS. Nevertheless, when examining the combined impact of gender and DM status on survival after HFS, results showed that survival post HFS differed significantly with gender and presence of DM (log-rank test, p?<?0.001), with males with DM performing worse than females with DM (p?=?0.021) or males without DM (p?=?0.001). This gender and disease-associated outcome should prompt an early multi-disciplinary team approach to the management of hip fractures in patients with DM. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a method that uses the intrinsic nature of local magnetic fields to enhance image contrast in order to improve the visibility of various susceptibility sources and to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. It is also the precursor to the concept of the use of phase for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Nowadays, SWI has become a widely used clinical tool to image deoxyhemoglobin in veins, iron deposition in the brain, hemorrhages, microbleeds and calcification. In this article, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for the imaging of stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, the improvement of SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.
