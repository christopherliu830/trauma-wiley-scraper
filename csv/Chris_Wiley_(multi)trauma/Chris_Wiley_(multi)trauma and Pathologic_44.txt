AB  - Aims:? The frequency of prostatic core biopsies to detect cancer has been increasing with more widespread prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. Gleason score has important implications for patient management but morphological reproducibility data for British practice are limited. Using literature-based criteria nine uropathologists took part in a reproducibility study. Methods:? Each of the nine participants submitted slides from consecutive cases of biopsy-diagnosed cancer assigned to the Gleason score groups 2?4, 5?6, 7 and 8?10 in the original report. A random selection of slides was taken within each group and examined by all pathologists, who were blind to the original score. Over six circulations, new slides were mixed with previously read slides, resulting in a total of 47 of 81 slides being read more than once. Results:? For the first readings of the 81 slides, the agreement with the consensus score was 78% and overall interobserver agreement was ? 0.54 for Gleason score groups 2?4, 5?6, 7, 8?10. Kappa values for each category were 0.33, 0.56, 0.44 and 0.68, respectively. For the 47 slides read more than once, intra-observer agreement was 77%, ? 0.66. The study identified problems in core biopsy interpretation of Gleason score at levels 2?4 and 7. Patterns illustrated by Gleason as 2 tended to be categorized as 3 because of the variable acinar size and unassessable lesional margin. In slides with consensus Gleason score 7, 13% of readings were scored 6 and in slides with consensus 6, 18% of readings were scored 7. Conclusions:? Recommendations include the need to increase objectivity of the Gleason criteria but limits of descriptive morphology may have to be accepted.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Abstract Mitochondria play a central role in the integration and execution of a wide variety of apoptotic signals. In the present study, we examined the deleterious effects of burn injury on heart tissue. We explored the effects of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) on cardiac injury in a murine burn injury model, with a focus on the protective effect of VNS on mitochondrial dysfunction in heart tissue. Mice were subjected to a 30% total body surface area, full-thickness steam burn followed by right cervical VNS for 10 min. and compared to burn alone. A separate group of mice were treated with the M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-AchR) antagonist 4-DAMP or phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 prior to burn and VNS. Heart tissue samples were collected at 6 and 24 hrs after injury to measure changes in apoptotic signalling pathways. Burn injury caused significant cardiac pathological changes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, mitochondrial swelling and decrease in myocardial ATP content at 6 and 24 hrs after injury. These changes were significantly attenuated by VNS. VNS inhibited release of pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to cytosol by increasing the expression of Bcl-2, and the phosphorylation level of Bad (pBad136) and Akt (pAkt308). These protective changes were blocked by 4-DAMP or LY294002. We demonstrated that VNS protected against burn injury?induced cardiac injury by attenuating mitochondria dysfunction, likely through the M3-AchR and the PI3K/Akt signalling pathways.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - Abstract The trans-activating response of DNA/RNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 pathology is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases via unknown mechanisms. Here, we use a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human wild-type neuronal TDP-43 to study the effects of TDP-43 pathology on glutamate metabolism and synaptic function. We found that neuronal TDP-43 over-expression affects synaptic protein expression, including Synapsin I, and alters surrounding astrocytic function. TDP-43 over-expression is associated with an increase in glutamate and ?-amino butyric acid and reduction of glutamine and aspartate levels, indicating impairment of presynaptic terminal. TDP-43 also decreases tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and induces oxidative stress via lactate accumulation. Neuronal TDP-43 does not alter microglia activity or significantly changes systemic and brain inflammatory markers compared to control. We previously demonstrated that brain-penetrant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), nilotinib and bosutinib, reduce TDP-43-induced cell death in transgenic mice. Here, we show that TKIs reverse the effects of TDP-43 on synaptic proteins, increase astrocytic function and restore glutamate and neurotransmitter balance in TDP-43 mice. Nilotinib, but not bosutinib, reverses mitochondrial impairment and oxidative metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that TKIs can attenuate TDP-43 toxicity and improve synaptic and astrocytic function, independent of microglial or other inflammatory effects. In conclusion, our data demonstrate novel mechanisms of the effects of neuronal TDP-43 over-expression on synaptic protein expression and alteration of astrocytic function.

AB  - Background The objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of occult upper gastrointestinal abnormalities, presence of gastric acid as a contributing factor, and associations with clinical outcomes. Methods Data were extracted for study participants at a single centre who had an endoscopy performed purely for research purposes and in whom treating physicians were not suspecting gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic data were independently adjudicated by two gastroenterologists who rated the likelihood that observed pathological abnormalities were related to gastric acid secretion using a 3-point ordinal scale (unlikely, possible or probable). Results Endoscopy reports were extracted for 74 patients [age 52 (37, 65) years] undergoing endoscopy on day 5 [3, 9] of ICU admission. Abnormalities were found in 25 (34%) subjects: gastritis/erosions in 10 (14%), nasogastric tube trauma in 8 (11%), oesophagitis in 4 (5%) and non-bleeding duodenal ulceration in 3 (4%). The contribution of acid secretion to observed pathology was rated ?probable? in six subjects (rater #1) and five subjects (rater #2). Prior to endoscopy, 39 (53%) patients were receiving acid-suppressive therapy. The use of acid-suppressive therapy was not associated with the presence of an endoscopic abnormality (present 15/25 (60%) vs. absent 24/49 (49%); P = 0.46). Haemoglobin concentrations, packed red cells transfused and mortality were not associated with mucosal abnormalities (P = 0.83, P > 0.9 and P > 0.9 respectively). Conclusions Occult mucosal abnormalities were observed in one-third of subjects. The presence of mucosal abnormalities appeared to be independent of prior acid-suppressive therapy and was not associated with reduced haemoglobin concentrations, increased transfusion requirements, or mortality.

AB  - Abstract Knee injuries are a common presentation to the ED and are often difficult to assess and definitively diagnose due to the patient's acute pain, effusion and guarding. The quality of ED care provided to patients with fractures or soft tissue injuries of the knee is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common knee injuries in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2250 articles, of which 54 were included in the review (n?=?8 primary articles, n?=?28 systematic reviews, n?=?18 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the knee in the ED, a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is consistent evidence to support undertaking a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of special tests and clinical decision rules for imaging. In the undifferentiated knee injury, expedited follow up and further imaging is recommended to improve patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - ABSTRACT The pathological features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The principle pathological feature is a chronic symmetrical polysynovitis. The pathological features of the joints varied in severity. The synovial membrane generally showed villous hypertrophy with aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Destruction of articular cartilage and bone occurred in association with a replacement granulation tissue which often produced a pannus over the articular surface. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated complexes of IgG or IgM with C3 in synovial lining cells, macrophages, blood vessel walls and free in the extracellular tissues. IgG and IgM producing plasma cells were also common. Fibrinogen deposits were extensive. The immunofluorescence findings were non-specific but support the concept of an immune complex mediated inflammation within the joints. Investigations for bacterial, mycoplasmal and viral infections of the joints were negative.

AB  - The anatomy of the cervical spine musculature visible on magnetic resonance (MR) images is poorly described in the literature. However, the correct identification of individual muscles is clinically important because certain conditions of the cervical spine, for example whiplash associated disorders, idiopathic neck pain, cervical nerve root avulsion and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, are associated with different morphological changes in specific muscles visible on MR images. Knowledge of the precise structure of different cervical spine muscles is crucial when comparisons with the contralateral side or with normal are required for accurate description of imaging pathology, management and assessment of treatment efficacy. However, learning the intricate arrangement of 27 muscles is challenging. A multi-level cross-sectional depiction combined with three-dimensional reconstructions could facilitate the understanding of this anatomically complex area. This paper presents a comprehensive series of labeled axial MR images from one individual and serves as a reference atlas of the cervical spine musculature to guide clinicians, researchers, and anatomists in the accurate identification of these muscles on MR imaging.

AB  - A 10-year-old male German shepherd dog was referred for evaluation of a cranial cervical mass causing progressively worsening respiratory distress. A fine-needle aspirate of the mass was obtained and the cytology results were compatible with a carcinoma. The dog underwent chemotherapy without clinical improvement and was ultimately euthanased because of clinical deterioration. At post-mortem examination, an irregular multi-lobated mass in the cranial cervical region was observed causing ventro-lateral tracheal deviation. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed a mixed population of CD3 lymphocytes and macrophages in an exuberant fibrous stroma, associated with dispersed cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells with marked eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of the epithelial cells were arranged in concentric clusters that were interpreted as Hassall's corpuscles. Histopathological examination of the thyroid gland revealed several neoplastic emboli composed of epithelial cells similar to those observed in the cervical mass. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an ectopic cervical thymic carcinoma in a dog.

By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - Summary According to transplant registries, grafts from elderly donors have lower survival rates. During 1999?2005, we evaluated the outcomes of 89 patients who received a liver from a donor aged ≥?60?years and managed with the low liver-damage strategy (LLDS), based on the preoperative donor liver biopsy and the shortest possible ischemia time (group D?≥?60-LLDS). Group D ≥?60-LLDS was compared with 198 matched recipients, whose grafts were not managed with this strategy (89 donors?<?60?years, group D?<?60-no-LLDS and 89 donors aged ≥60?years, group D?≥?60-no-LLDS). In the donors proposed from the age group of ≥60?years, the number of donors rejected decreased during the study period and the LLDS was found to be responsible for this in a significant manner (47% vs. 60%, respectively P?<?0.01). Among the recipients transplanted, the clinical features (age, gender, viral infection, child and model for end-stage liver disease score) were comparable among groups, but group D ≥?60-LLDS had a lower mean ischemia time: 415?±?106?min vs. 465?±?111 (D?<?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05 and vs. 476?±?94 (D?≥?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05. After a median follow-up of 3?years, the 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of group D ≥?60-LLDS (84% and 76%) were comparable with group D <?60-no-LLDS (89% and 76%) and were significantly higher than group D ≥?60-no-LLDS (71% and 54%), P?<?0.005. In conclusion, the LLDS optimized the use of livers from elderly donors.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Ultrasonography is associated with a high error rate in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. The purposes of this study were to examine the nature of the diagnostic errors and to identify areas in which reporting could be improved. Methods Patients who had soft tissue tumours and received ultrasonography during a 10-year period (1999?2009) were identified from a local tumour registry. The sonographic and pathological diagnoses were categorised as either ?benign? or ?non-benign?. The accuracy of ultrasonography was assessed by correlating the sonographic with the pathological diagnostic categories. Recommendations from radiologists, where offered, were assessed for their appropriateness in the context of the pathological diagnosis. Results One hundred seventy-five patients received ultrasonography, of which 60 had ?non-benign? lesions and 115 had ?benign? lesions. Ultrasonography correctly diagnosed 35 and incorrectly diagnosed seven of the 60 ?non-benign? cases, and did not suggest a diagnosis in 18 cases. Most of the diagnostic errors related to misdiagnosing soft tissue tumours as haematomas (four out of seven). Recommendations for further management were offered by the radiologists in 144 cases, of which 52 had ?non-benign? pathology. There were eight ?non-benign? cases where no recommendation was offered, and the sonographic diagnosis was either incorrect or unavailable. Conclusions Ultrasonography lacks accuracy in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. Ongoing education is required to improve awareness of the limitations with its use. These limitations should be highlighted to the referrers, especially those who do not have specific training in this area.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol exposure is known to sensitize acinar cells to various insults but the pathophysiological mechanisms of alcoholic pancreatitis remain unknown. Alcohol abuse has been shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory response and periods of immune suppression seem to be associated with organ injury and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts transcriptional activities in the rat pancreas and how alcohol alters the inflammatory response. Using the Lieber?DeCarli alcohol/control diet, rats that were fed with alcohol over 14 weeks demonstrated a decrease of inflammatory cells in pancreatic tissue compared to controls. The anti-inflammatory effects of alcohol were confirmed by decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-1?, IL-18, TGF?, and MCP-1. In addition, alcohol significantly increased the activity of PPAR?, which is a known anti-inflammatory transcription factor, while pro-inflammatory factors including AP-2 and EGR-1 were significantly suppressed. NF?B binding showed a tendency towards a reduction. Electron microscopy studies revealed enlarged and injured mitochondria and lysosomes, accompanied by peri-cellular fibrosis. Furthermore, alcohol exposure increased the activities of trypsin and cathepsin B, both known to be critical in initiating acinar cell injury and pancreatitis. Despite the known alcohol-mediated acinar cell and mitochondrial injury, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway was attenuated. These data demonstrate that the pancreas exposed to alcohol maintains an anti-inflammatory state by activating PPAR?. Intracellular mitochondrial and lysosomal damage after chronic alcohol exposure induces premature activation of digestive enzymes and establishment of peri-cellular fibrosis in the absence of inflammation.
