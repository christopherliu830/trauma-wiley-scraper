AB  - An approximately eight-year-old female grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was presented with a two months history of blindness. The radiographic examination showed a dilatation of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut. Ophthalmoscopy and electroretinography revealed degeneration of the retina. A proventricular dilatation disease was suspected. The bird was euthanased because of deteriorating condition and poor prognosis. The pathological examination showed an atrophy of the ventricular muscles and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the myenteric plexus of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut as well as moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the cerebrum with moderate neuronophagia. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the retina, indicating proventricular dilatation disease, and subsequent retinal degeneration were found. A potential common aetiology for proventricular dilatation disease and blindness is discussed.

AB  - In this paper, destructiveness is approached as a multi-dimensional phenomenon where the mental health perspective addresses only one of these dimensions. An attempt is made to locate this phenomenon in the context of epistemological and societal considerations. Critical of mono-dimensional explanations based on causal-reductive epistemology, the paper instead proposes the idea of an ?ecology of destructiveness?, according to which mental health professionals cannot possibly continue to assume the role of detached observers. The ordinariness and archetypal fascination of destructiveness are discussed as preventing the psychologizing and pathologizing of it. In addition, it is suggested that ?destructiveness may be a tragic facet of the human condition?, without this implying any justification of it. Based on my work with a group of Bosnian ex-camp prisoners, some basic principles of how one can work with survivors of atrocities are derived and discussed. A central feature of this work is the attempt to create an appropriate therapeutic context within which a ?therapeutic presence? and ?therapeutic witnessing? can be developed. Finally, the relevance of Jungian insights to this kind of work is reviewed and the emergence of new types of defences of the self is identified.

AB  - Objective To report clinical, laboratory and diagnostic imaging features and prognostic factors in dogs with leptospirosis from North-East Germany. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 99 dogs. At initial presentation, the most common clinical signs were lethargy (96%), anorexia (88%), vomiting (85%), painful abdomen (39%), diarrhoea (38%), oliguria (27%) and tachypnoea (26%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Abstract??? This clinical case study describes a multidisciplinary modified technique for the treatment of an oblique root fracture. A-38-year old woman with a history of trauma and a broken tooth was referred to our clinic. There was an oblique crown fracture extending the coronal third of the root just underneath the cingulum of the crown. The patient was willing to keep her tooth in function by any means. Two weeks after root canal therapy the flap was raised. The coronal two third of the root canal was enlarged. An impression of the enlarged root canal and tooth surface with surrounding bone was taken. The flap was sutured and the impression was sent to the laboratory for the post-casting preparation. After 7?days, the flap was opened again and casting was cemented. The flap was sutured. Ten days after the second surgery, three anterior teeth were prepared and a final impression was taken for the preparation of porcelain crowns. Restoration was finished 15?days after the second operation. The patient is still under maintenance therapy and the 12?month results are presented in this report. Extraction may not be the only alternative for the root fractures. Even for fractures under the alveolar margin, alternative multidisciplinary approaches can be used to restore and allow the tooth to survive.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - Screening mammography improved early detection of breast cancer and since then, the percentage of patients with node involvement is declining. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), although helpful in the diagnostic armamentarium of these patients, has consequential limitations. In these patients, moreover, lymphatic invasion (LI) is of utmost importance to determine the risk of local recurrence. To find an adjuvant histologic approach to assist in pre-operative analysis of the patient's risk for having LI and thus sentinel ± non-sentinel axillary lymph node metastasis, one hundred and twenty patients with early invasive duct carcinoma without axillary lymph node metastasis were evaluated. Logistic regression predictive models were built from 80 patients and validated in the remaining 40 patients. The final stepwise multi-regression analysis identified four sensitive models. In the validation group, model 1 [applicable to tumors grade 3 having micropapillary differentiation (MPD)] correctly identified 92.31% of patients with LI and confirmed LI [positive predictive value (PPV) = 83%], but with moderate sensitivity. Model 2 [applicable to tumors without MPD], model 3 [applicable to tumors grade 1/2], and model 4 [applicable to tumors grade 1/2 having no MPD] all had moderate PPV and a high negative predictive value (NPV) rendering these models reliable negative tests. However, as they had high sensitivity, positive results confirm the presence of LI. Patient with tumors grade 3 and MPD might need SLNB and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Patients having tumors grade 1/2, size <2 cm, and no MPD nor extensive retraction artifact, SLNB and/or ALND could be omitted. In tumors grade 1/2 (model 2) and those without MPD (model 3), the proposed models are reliable negative tests rather than a definitive positive one.

AB  - Abstract Scaffolds play a key role in the field of tissue engineering. Particularly for meniscus replacement, optimal scaffold properties are critical. The aim of our study was to develop a novel scaffold for replacement of meniscal tissue by means of tissue engineering. Emphasis was put on biomechanical properties comparable to native meniscus, nonimmunogenecity, and the possibility of seeding cells into and cultivating them within the scaffold (nontoxicity). For this purpose, native ovine menisci were treated in vitro in a self-developed enzymatic process. Complete cell removal was achieved and shown both histologically and electron microscopically (n?=?15). Immunohistochemical reaction (MHC 1/MHC 2) was positive for native ovine meniscus and negative for the scaffold. Compared to native meniscus (25.8 N/mm) stiffness of the scaffold was significantly increased (30.2 N/mm, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). We determined the compression (%) of the native meniscus and the scaffold under a load of 7 N. The compression was 23% for native meniscus and 29% for the scaffold (p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Residual force of the scaffold was significantly lower (5.2 N vs. 4.9 N, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Autologous fibrochondrocytes were needle injected and successfully cultivated within the scaffolds over a period of 4 weeks (n?=?10). To our knowledge, this study is the first to remove cells and immunogenetic proteins (MHC 1/MHC 2) completely out of native meniscus and preserve important biomechanical properties. Also, injected cells could be successfully cultivated within the scaffold. Further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are necessary to establish optimal cell sources, sterilization, and seeding techniques. Cell differentiation, matrix production, in vivo remodeling of the construct, and possible immunological reactions after implantation are subject of further studies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated.

AB  - ABSTRACT: We have been using alkaline phosphatase (AP) histochemical staining, formerly a research tool for the study of cerebral cortical vascular morphology, to examine pathological changes in the cortex and deep cerebral structures. Deep structures stain similarly to the cortex. The AP stain is found in the afferent vessels (small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries), but not in venules and veins. The stain is also present in leaky vessels, such as those in the area postrema. The vascular supply to the cerebrum is not homogeneous. Supply to the deep white matter, for instance, derives from the leptomeningeal border zone, and then medullary arterioles must wind their way for up to 4 cm before arriving at their ultimate destination. Adding to the difficulties, tortuosities develop in some of these vessels with aging. According to some calculations, hypertensive levels of blood pressure would be required to maintain irrigation through some of these vessels. We have identified a venous alteration that attends aging: periventricular venous collagenosis (PVC). PVC is a previously unrecognized, noninflammatory, mural disease of the periventricular veins. In severe cases, examples can be found of veins that are completely occluded by this process. PVC is found in 65% of subjects over 60 years old, and it strongly correlates with leukoaraiosis. In addition to previously mentioned aging-related changes, we have found extreme tortuosity, multiplications, and aneurysms of the smallest arterioles and lumpy-bumpy capillaries in the deep structures of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract We hypothesise that following a bone fracture there is systemic recruitment of bone forming cells to a fracture site. A rabbit ulnar osteotomy model was adapted to trace the movement of osteogenic cells. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from 41 NZW rabbits were isolated, culture-expanded and fluorescently labelled. The labelled cells were either re-implanted into the fracture gap (Group A); into a vein (Group B); or into a remote tibial bone marrow cavity 48 h after the osteotomy (Group C) or 4 weeks before the osteotomy was established (Group D), and a control group (Group E) had no labelled cells given. To quantify passive leakage of cells to an injury site, inert beads were also co-delivered in Group B. Samples of the fracture callus tissue and various organs were harvested at discrete sacrifice time-points to trace and quantify the labelled cells. At 3 weeks following osteotomy, the number of labelled cells identified in the callus of Group C, was significantly greater than following IV delivery, Group B, and there was no difference in the number of labelled cells in the callus tissues, between Groups C and A, indicating the labelled bone marrow cells were capable of migrating to the fracture sites from the remote bone marrow cavity. Significantly fewer inert beads than labelled cells were identified in Group B callus, suggesting some of the bone-forming cells were actively recruited and selectively chosen to the fracture site, rather than passively leaked into the circulation and to bone injury site. This investigation supports the hypothesis that some osteoblasts involved in fracture healing were systemically mobilised and recruited to the fracture from remote bone marrow sites. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays key roles in cell adhesion and migration. We now report that the delayed rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channel, through its LD-like motif in N-terminus, may interact with FAK and enhance phosphorylation of FAK397 and FAK576/577. Overlapping distribution of Kv2.1 and FAK was observed on soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. FAK expression promotes a polarized membrane distribution of the Kv2.1 channel. In Kv2.1-transfected CHO cells, formation of the Kv2.1-FAK complex was stimulated by fibronectin/integrin and inhibited by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). FAK phosphorylation was minimized by shRNA knockdown of the Kv2.1 channel, point mutations of the N-terminus, and TEA, respectively. Cell migration morphology was altered by Kv2.1 knockdown or TEA, hindering cell migration activity. In wound healing tests in vitro and a traumatic injury animal model, Kv2.1 expression and co-localization of Kv2.1 and FAK significantly enhanced directional cell migration and wound closure. It is suggested that the Kv2.1 channel may function as a promoting signal for FAK activation and cell motility. J. Cell. Physiol. 217: 544?557, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Porocarcinomas are thought to be differentiated into the acrosyringeal portion of the sweat duct, and they are relatively rare. It may develop from a long standing eccrine poroma undergoing malignant transformation or may arise de novo. We evaluated pathological and immunohistocheimical findings of six cases of eccrine porocarcinoma. Special stains (PAS and PAS with diastase) and immunohistochemical stainings (CEA, CAM5.2, CK7, bcl-2, p53 protein, and MIB-1) were performed. We observed asymmetrical architecture, cytological pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, ductal differentiation, intracytoplasmic lumina, mitotic activity, and melanin colonization. Three patients were male and four patients were female. The average age was 76 years. The time interval from tumor onset to treatment ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The mean size was 3.2?cm, and the mean depth of invasion was 1.0?cm. Four tumors were found on the head, one on the hip, and one on the foot. Regional lymph node metastases were noted in one case. Microscopically, luminal spaces and intracytoplasmic lumina were noted in all cases. Immunohistochemically, the mean MIB-1 index was 41%. P53 immunoreactivity was detected in five cases. Interestingly, a case of porocarcinoma with lymph node metastases showed high mitotic figures as well as less lymphocytic infiltration.

AB  - Abstract Young separated refugees are exiled from familiar places and on seeking asylum encounter new, potentially alienating, places. Yet, there is limited research regarding the effects of location on the psychological experiences of young separated refugees. This study explores the relationships that young adults who arrived in the UK as separated refugees have with the spaces that they inhabit and the consequences of these. It draws on qualitative interviews with young men from Iraq and Afghanistan who are living in London. Four key themes emerged from the analysis. Participants felt frustrated in bureaucratic settings where processes of labelling and physical manipulation prevented their sense of subjectivity from being expressed. Certain community spaces offered a rich range of support. Micro-spaces of belonging and embodied processes of exploration in the wider community were also reported to be psychologically beneficial. The themes suggest that considerations of young separated refugees' relations to place may provide alternative psychological understandings of their experiences, particularly in relation to concepts such as trauma. Policy implications related to immigration control and the benefits of community projects are highlighted. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The prospective study compares, in split-mouth design, the use of two different suture materials, silk vs. Teflon-coated, multi-filament braided polyester threads suture. Material and methods: Ten edentulous or partially edentulous patients were surgically treated for implant installation. Each side was sutured with either, randomly selected one or the other suture material. Seven days postsurgically, the sutures were removed and three knots per patient and side were collected for microbiological testing. Additionally, a piece of each suture thread was analysed before clinical use to test its susceptibility for bacterial adherence. To evaluate the patient's subjective opinion, a questionnaire based on Visual Analogue Scale had to be filled out by all included patients 1 week after the intervention. Results: The results showed a more pronounced plaque accumulation for silk sutures but there was not a statistical difference. The intraoperative handling of the silk sutures was less comfortable and the patient comfort was worse than Teflon-coated polyester suture. Conclusion: The bacterial adherence on Teflon-coated polyester suture was slightly inferior than silk suture although it did not show the expected differences.
