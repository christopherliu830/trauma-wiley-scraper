AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis is a major health concern in living populations, as well as being one of the most common pathological lesions identified in the archaeological record. The aetiology of the disease remains unclear, with a multi-factorial influence of physical strain, age, genetics, and obesity. Previous studies have identified a relationship between the presence of knee osteoarthritis on the distal femoral joint and the morphology of the intercondylar notch, patellar groove, and medial condyle. The current study expands this research to investigate the relationship between distal femoral, distal humeral, and proximal ulnar joint morphology and osteoarthritis with 3D shape analysis techniques. These methods provide a more detailed analysis of joint morphology in order to determine any relationship between 3D shape and osteoarthritis. The results indicate a complex relationship between joint shape and knee osteoarthritis, with eburnated right femora showing a statistically significant association. The shapes associated with eburnated or affected femoral joints can be explained by osteophyte development, and therefore likely represent systematic shape changes and not a particular joint shape predisposing individuals to the condition. There was no identifiable relationship found in the proximal ulna or distal humerus, indicating that joint shape is unlikely to influence the development of the condition in the elbow joint and that any shape changes produced by osteoarthritis are not systematic or quantifiable. The joints analysed in this study were highly influenced by asymmetry, sexual dimorphism, and allometry, resulting in a small sample size of affected joints in many datasets. Further analyses of large skeletal samples are needed to more thoroughly investigate the possible relationship of distal femoral joint shape and osteoarthritis.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - Abstract From August to November 1992, five typhoons struck the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. Three hundred and twenty subjects exposed to all five typhoons participated in a population survey measuring their acute stress symptoms and subsequent diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. A 23-item scale approximating the new DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) was used to classify subjects into three groups based on their symptoms one week after the first typhoon: (1) probable ASD, (2) an early traumatic stress response (ETSR) of fear, intrusion, avoidance, and arousal, without dissociation, and (3) no acute diagnosis. A multi-dimensional measure of PTSD and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were used to assess PTSD and depression 8 months after the first storm. The point prevalence of ASD at one week was 7.2%. An additional 15% of subjects had ETSR. Subjects with probable ASD at one week had significantly increased rates of PTSD and somewhat higher rates of depression at 8 months than those without ASD. In contrast, subjects with ETSR at one week did not have a poorer outcome than those with no acute diagnosis. These findings suggest that ASD is prognostically important, but also indicate that all acute stress symptoms do not have the same discriminative value. In this study, the acute dissociative symptoms of emotional numbing and derealization differentiated highly symptomatic subjects at risk for subsequent psychopathology (ASD) from others who were highly symptomatic at one week, but then had a more benign, posttraumatic course (ETSR).

AB  - Summary Psychology pervades all aspects of human life. To better understand the psychology of violence, especially as it is relevant beyond the surface, psychological principles can prove very useful. Psychology can shed light on human violence in terms of different levels of motivation, defenses, and paradoxical thinking. Violence is complex and can be difficult to understand at first glance. It helps to know, therefore, how hidden motives form and how understandable attempts to avoid emotional pain can result in maladaptive behavior and cause pain in return. For this, we cannot reduce psychology to the currently popular neuroscience, cognitivism, or behaviorism. Rather, we will have to understand it in its own right. The branch that deals with deeper motives and unconscious processes, as are helpful to understanding violence, is psychodynamic theory. Psychodynamic theory can be particularly helpful to identifying various defense mechanisms, paradoxical aspects of the mind, and the importance of early experiences in understanding how individuals or groups turn violent. While its scope of intrapsychic events can be a drawback, delving into intimate emotional life is essential to understanding the depths of the mind. More recent concepts in positive psychology can also complement traditional approaches and help us to avert determinism in trauma and violence.

AB  - An 11-month-old Border collie presented collapsed and continued to deteriorate rapidly despite supportive treatment. The dog had a history of failure to thrive and recurring respiratory infection. Laboratory abnormalities included neutrophilic leucocytosis, Heinz body anaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria and hypocobalaminaemia. Post-mortem examination revealed multi-focal necrosis within the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, meninges and cerebral cortex. Fungal hyphae in lesions were identified as Scedosporium prolificans following culture. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that the dog carried the CUBN:c.8392delC mutation in a homozygous state, verifying hereditary cobalamin deficiency (a.k.a. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Cobalamin deficiency may have been a predisposing factor for the development of systemic fungal infection in this dog.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the Leipzig Stifle Distractor (LSD) for arthroscopic evaluation of the medial meniscus. Study Design Prospective clinical multi-center study. Animals 64 stifles of 64 dogs (mean body weight 35 kg) with suspected cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Methods The LSD was used to distract the medial compartment and to evaluate the medial meniscus. The degree of exposure of the caudal pole of the medial meniscus (CMM) and ease of diagnosis was quantified after either distraction with the LSD or manipulation of the stifle with valgus stress and external rotation. Time for pin placement, level of difficulty and associated complications with LSD application were recorded. Medial collateral ligament integrity was tested by stress radiographs. Results The mean time for applying the LSD was 1.4 minutes (range 0.5?3.0). Application was considered easy in 90% and moderate in 10% of joints, with no complications recorded. LSD application increased exposure (P?<?.001) and facilitated probing of the CMM (P?<?.001), allowing for the diagnosis of 10 meniscal tears missed without the LSD. The use of LSD increased the likelihood of diagnosing a meniscal tear by 1.9 times. Based on the stress radiographs, medial collateral ligament integrity was maintained in all tested stifles. Conclusion Diagnosis of medial meniscal tears was improved using LSD. The LSD provided a safe and effective method for improved visualization and access to the caudal portion of the medial meniscus, which may allow for better arthroscopic assessment of meniscal pathology in dogs.

AB  - Background and Objectives Scar rehabilitation is a complex process that incorporates medical, surgical, and physical therapeutic measures to best restore function and visual normalcy. Lasers have emerged as essential tools in the management of scars, with devices available to address scar size, dyschromia, and contour irregularities. As different lasers treat these different features, multi-laser, same session therapeutic approaches may offer a more comprehensive approach to scar revision. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the effect of a combinatorial, same session treatment with intense pulsed light (IPL) and fractional ablative CO2 as compared to single laser treatment with fractional ablative CO2 laser alone or control in the treatment of mature hypertrophic scars. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, randomized controlled trial, enrolled 23 healthy adults with large (>100?cm2) hypertrophic scars who were randomized to one of three treatment arms: (i) IPL and CO2 ablative fractional laser (AFL), (ii) CO2 AFL alone, and (iii) control (no laser treatment). Subjects underwent a total of four treatment sessions at 6?8-week intervals with follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months following the last treatment session. Primary endpoints included blinded scoring of before and after photographs via the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS). Secondary endpoints included the Patient-Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Results As compared to control and CO2 AFL laser alone, the combination of CO2 AFL and IPL demonstrated statistically significant improvement across a greater number of scar domains, as assessed by the MSS. 100% of subjects in both treatment groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the POSAS scale after the series of four treatment sessions. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion Treatment with combined IPL and CO2 AFL demonstrated higher average improvements across the majority of assessed scar domains, as compared to both control and CO2 laser alone. The difference was not statistically significant in overall MSS score as expected due to the role of CO2 as the main source of improvement. However, only the combination group had statistically significant improvement in both color and texture. These findings support the assertion that a multi-photo-thermolytic approach with combined IPL and CO2 AFL can have a positive impact on the treatment of hypertrophic scars by using multiple wavelengths to maximize laser-skin interactions in targeting the different chromophores expressed in scar tissue.

AB  - The ABH and Lewis antigens were among the first of the human red blood cell polymorphisms to be identified and, in the case of the former, play a dominant role in transfusion and transplantation. But these two therapies are largely twentieth-century innovations, and the ABH and related carbohydrate antigens are not only expressed on a very wide range of human tissues, but were present in primates long before modern humans evolved. Although we have learned a great deal about the biochemistry and genetics of these structures, the biological roles that they play in human health and disease are incompletely understood. This review and its companion, which appeared in a previous issue of Vox Sanguinis, will focus on a few of the biologic and pathologic processes which appear to be affected by histo-blood group phenotype. The first of the two reviews explored the interactions of two bacteria with the ABH and Lewis glycoconjugates of their human host cells, and described the possible connections between the immune response of the human host to infection and the development of the AB-isoagglutinins. This second review will describe the relationship between ABO phenotype and thromboembolic disease, cardiovascular disease states, and general metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS) is a low-grade malignant neoplasm for which limited genetic information, including a t(1;10)(p22;q24) and amplification of chromosome 3 material, is available. To further characterize these aberrations, we have investigated eight soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed as MIFS, haemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumour (HFT), myxoid spindle cell/pleomorphic sarcoma with MIFS features, and inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation (IMFH) harbouring a t(1;10) or variants thereof and/or ring chromosomes with possible involvement of chromosome 3. Using chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, array-based comparative genomic hybridization, global gene expression, and real-time quantitative PCR analyses, we identified the breakpoint regions on chromosomes 1 and 10, demonstrated and delineated the commonly amplified region on chromosome 3, and assessed the consequences of these alterations for gene expression. The breakpoints in the t(1;10) mapped to TGFBR3 in 1p22 and in or near MGEA5 in 10q24, resulting in transcriptional up-regulation of NPM3 and particularly FGF8, two consecutive genes located close to MGEA5. The ring chromosomes contained a commonly amplified 1.44 Mb region in 3p11?12, which was associated with increased expression of VGLL3 and CHMP2B. The identified genetic aberrations were not confined to MIFS; an identical t(1;10) was also found in a case of HFT and the amplicon in 3p was seen in an IMFH.

AB  - Gerhard Roth's novel from 1986, Am Abgrund, stands at the center of hismonumental and multi-genre cycle, Die Archive des Schweigens. On one level, the novel can be read as an allegory of modern Austria, which Roth has called a ?Reich des Schweigens.? Its main protagonists?the mute, ostensibly insane Lindner and the law student-cum-murderer Jenner?could represent the twinned dimensions of post-war Austrian silence: guilt and trauma. More broadly, Am Abgrund enacts a post-rational subjectivity that is dispersed over a ground of multivalent and supremely powerful silence. Narrative agency, scattered among multiple figures, is attenuated to the point of nearly disappearing. Roth has said ?das Untersuchen ist eine Krankheitvon mir,? an illness he shares with the novel's third protagonist, the magistrate Sonnenberg. But through this pathologically tinged compulsion, Roth's fiction ultimately makes present a mute reality that can only be traced and silhouetted, but never penetrated, by language.

AB  - Abstract Osteonecrosis is a severe complication of radiotherapy for cancer. Prevention of osteonecrosis is most important, as the condition may be chronic, progressive, and lead to pathologic fracture. The clinical experience, of 627 dental extractions at the Cancer Control Agency of British Columbia either before or after radiotherapy is presented.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.
