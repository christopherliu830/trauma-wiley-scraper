AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The pathogenetic mechanisms causing a dementing brain disease after temporary ischemia, heat shock, or brain trauma are surveyed. These lesions increase beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) synthesis. This process is potentiated by an ischemic glutamate release that opens cellular Ca2+ channels, inhibiting glucose turnover and ATP production, which is, under these conditions, accompanied by the generation of beta amyloid (beta A), even in young persons. Beta amyloid starts a vicious circle by inactivating the glycolytic key enzyme, phos-phofructokinase, which, with age, exhausts the functional reserve capacity of the brain. This demonstrates that beta A is an epiphenomenon of a dementing brain disease, triggered by the disturbance of glucose turnover and oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical studies have shown that a dementing brain disease can be clearly objectified and monitored by 18F-2-deoxyglucose PET studies. This paper looks briefly a pharmacologic approaches to this disease using models of temporary ischemia, the testing of 14C-deoxyglucose turnover, or examination with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. In conclusion, the key process of all dementing brain diseases of the Alzheimer type is a decreased glucose turnover and subsequently decreased oxidative phosphorylation, linked directly to a secondary amyloid formation and nerve cell atrophy.

However, latest research shows that chest ultrasound has superior accuracy when compared to supine chest X ray for diagnosing most chest injuries. Is it time we allowed ultrasound to supersede supine chest X ray as the initial investigative modality of choice for the patient with thoracic trauma?

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents findings of a common MMPI profile configuration for a small forensic sample (n = 16) of persons traumatized by life-threatening civilian events or as a consequence of combat in the Vietnam War. All subjects were involved in lawsuits in which the issue of compensation, medical benefits, or criminal disposition and sentencing were important concerns. A review of the existing empirical studies using this full MMPI scale as well as the MMPI post-traumatic subscale are discussed. In comparing the civilian and veteran samples on the MMPI clinical, validity, and subscales a number of statistically significant differences were found by analyses of variance and mean comparison tests of the data. While the profile configuration of both groups were similar (elevations on F, 8 and 2 scales), the Vietnam Veteran sample had significantly higher elevations. It was concluded that identifying an MMPI trauma profile and its variations may did in the diagnosis and assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - SUMMARY One hundred and ninety-five magnetic resonance (MR) images (1.5 Tesla) of 167 patients with neurological impairment following spinal trauma were reviewed. Acute cord injury produces central haemorrhagic necrosis that extends transversely and longitudinally with time and increased injury severity. Oedoma is more homogeneous, extensive and dominant in minimal lesions. Magnetic resonance appearances correlate with neurological status and outcome. Patients with MR evidence of cord blood had severe clinical lesions and failed to show useful clinical improvement. Patients with homogeneous ?oedema?improved to useful function. Lesion signal inhomogeneity relates to a worse prognosis. The clinical level correlates closely with cord blood or signal in homogeneity but imprecisely with homogeneous oedema. Disc herniations require differentiation from epidural blood and venous engorgement, which are prominent with bone displacement. Magnetic resonance is recommended in incomplete cord syndromes and in cord injuries with no apparent fracture, particularly if clinically deteriorating. Chronic injury consists of cavitation, extensive gliosis, cord atrophy and leptomeningeal fibrosis. Progressive myelopathy may result from cystic or non-cystic intramedullary lesions. Cord cysts are common and cyst fluid signal should closely follow cerebrospinal fluid. Turbulent cyst fluid motion is commoner in larger cysts and may predict those cysts more prone to propagate. Progressive syrinxes show typical appearances, usually with transverse septa. Atrophy and propagating syrinxes usually take years to develop. Leptomeningeal cysts and spinal stenosis caused by bone displacement and accelerated adjacent disc disease may cause late deterioration. In progressive myelopathy following injury, surgically drainable cysts are clearly differentiable from cord gliosis and atrophy.

AB  - Aims:? Although the synoptic format is being increasingly used for primary cutaneous melanoma pathology reporting, no study assessing its value has yet been reported in the literature. The aim was to determine whether the use of synoptic reports increases the frequency with which pathological features that may influence prognosis and guide management are documented. Methods and results:? Melanoma pathology reports (n?=?1692) were evaluated; 904 were in a synoptic format [671 Sydney Melanoma Unit (SMU) reports and 233 non-SMU reports] and 788 were non-synoptic (184 SMU reports and 604 non-SMU reports). Reports (n?=?1354) from 677 patients who had both a SMU report and a non-SMU report were compared. Almost all features were reported more frequently in synoptic than in non-synoptic reports (P?<?0.001). No significant differences were found in the frequency of reporting the main pathological features between SMU and non-SMU synoptic reports. Synoptic reports were more frequently used by SMU (78%) than by non-SMU pathologists (28%). Conclusions:? This is the first study to provide objective evidence that synoptic pathology reports for melanoma are more complete than non-synoptic reports (regardless of whether the reports are generated within or outside a specialist melanoma centre). All synoptic reports should include the facility for free text, be tailored to individual institutional requirements and be updated regularly to be of maximal value.

AB  - Young children are disproportionately exposed to interpersonal trauma (maltreatment, witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) and appear particularly susceptible to negative sequelae. Little is known about the factors influencing vulnerability to traumatic stress responses and other negative outcomes in early life. This study examined associations among interpersonal trauma exposure, sociodemographic risk, developmental competence, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 200 children assessed from birth to first grade via standardized observations, record reviews, and maternal and teacher interviews. More severe PTSD symptoms were predicted by greater trauma exposure (r = .43), greater sociodemographic risk (r = .22), and lower developmental competence (rs = ?.31 and ?.54 for preschool and school-age developmental competence, respectively). Developmental competence partially mediated the association between trauma exposure and symptoms. Trauma exposure fully mediated the association between sociodemographic risk and symptoms. Neither sociodemographic risk nor developmental competence moderated trauma exposure effects on symptoms. The findings suggest that (a) exposure to maltreatment and IPV has additive effects on posttraumatic stress risk in early life, (b) associations between sociodemographic adversity and poor mental health may be attributable to increased trauma exposure in disadvantaged populations, and (c) early exposures have a negative cascade effect on developmental competence and mental health.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - Abstract Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [NÂ =Â 1036, PÂ =Â 2.61Â ?Â 10?8 (dominant model), PÂ =Â 7.76Â ?Â 10?8 (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323Â kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (NÂ =Â 1394, PÂ =Â 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior. Identifying mechanisms underlying risk for problematic alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations is critical for future treatment and prevention efforts.

AB  - Background:? Road traffic accidents are the main cause of trauma in Malaysia. It has been shown that there was an increase in admissions for trauma patients older than 60?years in the last decade. The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of maxillofacial injuries in the geriatric patients referred to Seremban Hospital, Malaysia. Methods:? Records of patients aged 60?years or older who sustained oral and maxillofacial injuries between 1998 and 2002 were reviewed. Data related to age, sex, race, etiology, types of injuries and treatment modalities were obtained. Results:? A total of 134 geriatric patients with maxillofacial and dental injuries were seen in Seremban Hospital between January 1998 and December 2002. There were 101 (75.4%) men and 33 (24.6%) women. The age ranged 60?92?years with the mean age of 68.3?years (standard deviation, 7.48). Chinese made up the majority of the patients (51.8%), followed by Malays (37.2%), Indian (20.4%) and other ethnic groups (1.5%). The most common cause of injury was due to road traffic accidents (64.2%) However, falls were more common in those aged 76?years and above. The most common bone fracture documented was the mandible (35.7%) followed by fracture of the zygomatic complex (34.0%). The majority of treatment was conservative or closed reduction. Conclusion:? All the elderly patients with facial trauma were managed conservatively or as closed reduction in this hospital. This was largely because of their comorbid state and financial constraints.

This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: We present a protocol for the non-invasive angiographic assessment of the arterial and venous cerebrovascular (CV) system by multi-slice CT. Material and Methods: Data acquisition was performed in a multi-slice CT scanner with a scan range from the carotid bifurcation to the vertex and manual scan start following i.v. administration of 120 ml iodinated contrast medium with a flow rate of 4 ml/s. This protocol was applied in 12 patients with symptoms of acute CV insuffiency. Results: In all patients, comprehensive imaging of the arteriovenous CV system was achieved including the common carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries, the dural sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Various CV pathologies, such as a territorial artery occlusion, a thrombotic obstruction of the internal carotid artery, an intracranial arteriovenous malformation and a sinus vein thrombosis, were successfully evaluated. Conclusion: Comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CV system is possible by the use of a single-bolus, monophasic multi-slice scan technique.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relation between acculturation and socioecological contexts of migrants with a personal trauma history living in the community. This study represents an extension of our previous work and aimed to unpack the perceived neighborhood ethnic density (ED) effect and examine the moderating role of ED on the acculturation?adjustment relation in a community sample of migrants with trauma (N?=?99) from developing countries residing in Montreal, Canada. ED was protective against general psychological distress but did not predict posttraumatic symptoms. The ED effect was mediated via degree of acculturation to the French?Canadian mainstream cultural context, rather than heritage acculturation, social support, or discrimination. Moreover, protective effects of French?Canadian mainstream acculturation for depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were found under high but not low ED conditions. Similarities and differences with our previous research as well as theoretical and prevention implications are discussed from a person?environment interaction perspective.
