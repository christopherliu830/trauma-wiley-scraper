AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Abstract Astrogliopathy refers to alterations of astrocytes occurring in diseases of the nervous system, and it implies the involvement of astrocytes as key elements in the pathogenesis and pathology of diseases and injuries of the central nervous system. Reactive astrocytosis refers to the response of astrocytes to different insults to the nervous system, whereas astrocytopathy indicates hypertrophy, atrophy/degeneration and loss of function and pathological remodeling occurring as a primary cause of a disease or as a factor contributing to the development and progression of a particular disease. Reactive astrocytosis secondary to neuron loss and astrocytopathy due to intrinsic alterations of astrocytes occur in neurodegenerative diseases, overlap each other, and, together with astrocyte senescence, contribute to disease-specific astrogliopathy in aging and neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates in old age. In addition to the well-known increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein and other proteins in reactive astrocytes, astrocytopathy is evidenced by deposition of abnormal proteins such as ?-amyloid, hyper-phosphorylated tau, abnormal α-synuclein, mutated huntingtin, phosphorylated TDP-43 and mutated SOD1, and PrPres, in Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, Lewy body diseases, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, respectively. Astrocytopathy in these diseases can also be manifested by impaired glutamate transport; abnormal metabolism and release of neurotransmitters; altered potassium, calcium and water channels resulting in abnormal ion and water homeostasis; abnormal glucose metabolism; abnormal lipid and, particularly, cholesterol metabolism; increased oxidative damage and altered oxidative stress responses; increased production of cytokines and mediators of the inflammatory response; altered expression of connexins with deterioration of cell-to-cell networks and transfer of gliotransmitters; and worsening function of the blood brain barrier, among others. Increased knowledge of these aspects will permit a better understanding of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases in old age as complex disorders in which neurons are not the only players.

AB  - Glandular and pseudoglandular tumors of the penile skin are extremely uncommon and can present diagnostic challenges. Primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the penis is an extremely rare tumor, composed of distinct areas of malignant squamous and glandular cells, making it a diagnostically challenging entity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes several subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), each with its own distinctive pathologic appearance, clinical associations and prognosis. Among these variants is the exceedingly uncommon adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), representing 1%?2% of all SCC of the penis. Recent large studies have interrogated the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in malignant penile tumors and have shown specific morphologic patterns and clinical presentations to associate with HPV status. However, given the rarity of the adenosquamous variant of SCC, it has largely been excluded from these studies. The glandular components of these lesions can present a confusing appearance, particularly when a large tumor is represented on a small biopsy. Here we describe a difficult histologic presentation of this rare tumor, with the first published characterization of the HPV status of this subtype. This case represents a distinctly unusual case of metastatic HPV-positive primary cutaneous adenosquamous carcinoma of the penis.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Abstract Craniofacial asymmetries can be classified based on aetiology and on the anatomical structures involved. While the causes of facial asymmetry are numerous, they are best divided into three categories: congenital, developmental and acquired. Craniosynostosis is the pathological premature fusion of one or more sutures in the cranial vault. The premature fusion of the coronal suture with extension to involve the frontosphenoidal suture of the cranial base affects the normal development of the orbital-frontal-parietal region on the involved side. Facial asymmetries of the typical unilateral facial clefts and the atypical craniofacial clefts are self-evident.32 In the typical unilateral cleft lip and palate, the anatomical structures are distorted by the embryological disruption in failure of fusion between the maxillary prominence and medial nasal processes and between the palatine processes and the nasal septum that contribute to the palatal cleft.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the level of agreement between trained ED nursing staff and senior ED medical staff in the application and interpretation of the National Emergency X-radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) low-risk criteria (NLC). Methods:? A NEXUS training and accreditation package was developed. It was successfully undertaken by 22 senior ED nursing staff and 26 senior ED medical staff. A study nurse and doctor independently applied the NLC to a convenience sample of patients who had been placed in a hard cervical collar prior to arrival in the ED. The findings for each of the NLC and the overall decision regarding collar removal were recorded on specific case report forms. The primary endpoint was the level of agreement for the overall decision to leave the collar in place. Levels of agreement for the individual NLC were also examined. Results:? In total, 183 patients were recruited. The level of ?safe agreement? where nursing and medical staff agreed that the collar should be left in place was 94.3% (95% CI: 89.5?97.2%). Agreement with regard to individual NLC varied from good to fair. The median times from patient arrival to completion of study nurse and doctor assessments were 14?min (interquartile ranges [IQR] 5?30) and 29?min (IQR 15?47), respectively. Conclusion:? The study demonstrated a high level of agreement between nursing and medical staff for stable low-risk trauma patients.

AB  - Summary:? During the past several years, there has been increasing interest in the role of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) in epilepsy. Advances in neuroradiology have enhanced our ability to image and study the human cerebrovasculature, and further developments in the research of metabolic deficiencies linked to seizure disorders (e.g., GLUT1 deficiency), neuroinflammation, and multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have amplified the significance of the BBB's relationship to epilepsy. ?Prior to 1986, BBB research in epilepsy focused on three main areas: ultrastructural studies, brain glucose availability and transport, and clinical uses of AEDs. However, contrast-based imaging techniques and medical procedures such as BBB disruption provided a framework that demonstrated that the BBB could be reversibly disrupted by pathologic or iatrogenic manipulations, with important implications in terms of CNS drug delivery to ?multiple drug resistant? brain. This concept of BBB breakdown for therapeutic purposes has also unveiled a previously unrecognized role for BBB failure as a possible etiologic mechanism in epileptogenesis. Finally, a growing body of evidence has shown that inflammatory mechanisms may participate in the pathological changes observed in epileptic brain, with increasing awareness that blood-borne cells or signals may participate in epileptogenesis by virtue of a leaky BBB. In this article we will review the relationships between BBB function and epilepsy. In particular, we will illustrate consensus and divergence between clinical reality and animal studies.

AB  - Introduction Clinical trials that involve participants from multiple sites necessitate standardized and reliable quantitative MRI outcomes to detect significant group differences over time. Metabolite concentrations measured by proton MRS (1H-MRS) provide valuable information about in vivo metabolism of the central nervous system, but can vary based on the acquisition and quantitation methods used by different MR sites. Therefore, we investigated the intra- and inter-site reproducibility of metabolite concentrations measured by 1H-MRS on MRI scanners from a single manufacturer across six sites. Methods Five healthy controls were scanned twice within 24 h at six participating 3 T MR sites with large single-voxel PRESS (TE/TR/NSA = 36 ms/4000 ms/56) and anatomical images for voxel positioning and correction of partial volume relaxation. Absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated relative to the T1 and T2 relaxation corrected signal from water. Intra- and inter-site reproducibility was assessed using Bland?Altman plots and intra- and inter-site coefficient of variation (CoV) as well as intra- and inter-site intra-class correlation coefficient. Results The median intra-site CoVs for the five major metabolite concentrations ([NAA], [tCr], [Glu], [tCho] and [Ins]) were between 2.5 and 5.3%. Inter-site CoVs were also low, with the median CoVs for all metabolites between 3.7 and 6.4%. Metabolite concentrations were robust to small inconsistencies in voxel placement and site was not the driving factor in the variance of the measurement of any metabolite concentration. Between-subject differences accounted for the majority of the concentration variability for creatine, choline and myo-inositol (42?65% of the variance). Conclusion A large single-voxel 1H-MRS acquisition from a single manufacturer's MRI scanner is highly reproducible and reliable for multi-site clinical trials.

More recently, lung ultrasound gained importance throughout artefacts analysis to help clinical evaluation at bedside and became subject of interest in the paediatric intensive care and emergency department settings for both procedural and diagnostic purposes. The normal pattern of lung ultrasound is defined by the presence of lung sliding associated with A-lines whereas B-lines may be representative of pathologic findings. This review focuses on some of the most common pulmonary conditions, their respective sonographic features and clinical implications in the emergency department and paediatric intensive care unit.

AB  - ABSTRACT Renal amyloidosis was diagnosed in six related English foxhounds from two separate hunting kennels. There was no apparent age or sex predilection. All the dogs had clinical and laboratory findings compatible with renal disease. The onset of clinical signs was acute in all cases with death or euthanasia in five of the six affected dogs occurring within one week of presentation. The remaining dog was treated with diuresis which produced a temporary improvement. Histological examination of renal tissue from affected dogs identified the presence of both glomerular and interstitial amyloid, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining to be of the reactive type (amyloid A). There were occasional sclerosed glomeruli or glomeruli with thickened Bowman's capsules, in addition to interstitial and periglomerular infiltration with a predominance of plasma cells and lymphocytes and secondary changes including tubular eosinophilic casts. Renal papillary necrosis was identified in three dogs. One hound had concurrent multicentric lymphoma. Pedigree analysis of the affected dogs revealed that four individuals shared a common great grandsire and that the same dog was the grand-sire of a further case. Pedigree analysis of five additional dogs from one of the kennels, all of which had clinical signs of acute renal failure but from which renal tissue was not available, revealed a close relationship to those foxhounds with confirmed renal amyloidosis.

The aim of the study was to obtain detailed information on the state of preservation of these ?anatomical mummies? and the techniques used to prepare them. Relying on the existing literature, the examined specimens (five heads with necks, two busts and one heart) could be divided into three types of anatomical specimens: ?dry preparations,? ?corrosion preparations,? and ?organ preparations.? CT examination enabled the assessment of the exact features of each specimen, some of the preparation techniques applied, the presence of foreign bodies, and the use of substances to fill the blood vessels. All of the cases demonstrated an extremely good state of preservation. The study sheds new light on important-yet scarcely known-preparation techniques created for different anatomical demonstrations. Results of the CT investigation were consistent with the anatomical preservation methods described in 18th to 20th century literature, particularly those of Italy. Clin.

AB  - Summary The knee is the largest and most complex joint in the body and a wide variety of bone and soft tissue injuries are seen in the knee. Trauma to the knee can result in injury to the bone, articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments. Fractures of the proximal tibia, particularly those that extend into the knee joint, are serious injuries that frequently result in functional impairment. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have given this modality a prominent role in the detection and classification of fractures in and around the knee. With the advent of high-performance multi-detector CT, isotropic data sets can be generated with subsecond gantry rotation times and submillimetre slice thickness. CT arthrography can clearly demonstrate many lesions in the plethora of internal derangement of the knee. CT arthrography also deserves its advantage as it may be used to evaluate knee injuries in patients where magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. In this article we discuss the indications for imaging of knee injuries by CT, present the advantages of multi-detector CT and CT arthrography, and provide examples that highlight the utility of CT in the evaluation of the knee injuries.

AB  - Murder of a loved one typically has a tremendous impact on the family as a whole and on individual members. While it is true people often react in very similar ways following such a traumatic loss, they do not necessarily grieve in the same way or at the same time. Additionally, the murder may have a detrimental effect on the stability, developmental tasks, communication patterns, and role functioning of the family. This paper explores some of the many issues and challenges families must face in the aftermath of a murder.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a dynamic pathological process where excess amounts of thrombin, the principal role player in the clotting pathway, are generated intravascularly. The diagnosis of DIC is very often suspected in critically ill patients although the clinical features can vary according to the underlying disease state initiating this process. A combination of tests performed in repeats is necessary to reliably diagnose DIC. The principal aim in the management of this condition involves timely and appropriate treatment of the triggering process with adequate transfusion support and certain therapeutic agents in selected situations.

AB  - This 4-year prospective study investigated the reasons for high levels of gangrene and major amputation in diabetic renal transplant patients and whether regular mutli-disciplinary foot care could reduce morbidity. All foot lesions were documented and investigated in 50 diabetic patients, mean age 49.2 ± 11.0 (SD) years, duration of diabetes 25.3 ± 9.0 years, time since renal transplantation 60.2 ± 35.1 months, who attended a special foot clinic monthly for education, vascular and neurological assessment, podiatry and footwear. Foot lesions included: neuropathic ulcers, ischaemic ulcers, traumatic lesions, Charcot's arthropathy, pathological fracture. Treatment included antibiotics, podiatry, footwear, and angioplasty or distal bypass where appropriate. Only 13 patients were deemed ischaemic but peripheral neuropathy was a very common finding (mean VPT 24.8 ± 12.9 V). Gangrene and major amputations showed a decrease on previous years and healing times for lesions were similar to those previously reported in diabetic patients without renal transplants. The majority of foot lesions, both in soft tissue and bone, were related to neuropathy and trauma and responded well to optimal foot care within the renal unit. Gangrene and major amputations were usually preventable.

AB  - Objectives To review the surgical results and to identify possible parameters influencing the clinical outcomes in an unselected patient collective undergoing minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion in a spinal care unit. Methods A total of 229 adult patients who underwent minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion between 2008 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Lumbar fusion was performed using transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) devices and posterolateral fusion. To eliminate confounding parameters, in all patients interbody fusion was indicated by lumbar degenerative pathologies, and surgery was performed using the same fusion device. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using scores describing pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]) and health impairment (EQ-5D, Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). The influence of patient age, obesity, active smoking status, and co-morbidities on clinical outcome and perioperative complications was analyzed. Results The patient population reviewed had improved VAS (P(leg pain) ≤ 0.0001, P(back pain) ≤ 0.0001), ODI (P ≤ 0.0001), EQ-VAS (P ≤ 0.0001), and EQ-5D subscales ?mobility?, ?self-care?, ?pain?, and ?anxiety? (P(mobility) ≤ 0.0001, P(self-care)?=?0.41, P(pain) ≤ 0.0001, P(anxiety)?=?0.011) postoperatively. Neither advanced patient age, nor increased body mass index (BMI), hypertension, or active smoking status had a significantly limiting influence on the success of minimally invasive spinal surgeries (MIS). Duration of surgery strongly correlated with the number of spinal levels treated and with intraoperative blood loss (r?=?0.774, P ≤ 0.0001, n?=?208). Weak positive correlations were found between patient age and duration of surgery (r?=?0.184, P?=?0.005, n?=?229), intraoperative blood loss (r?=?0.165, P?=?0.012, n?=?229), and duration of hospitalization (r?=?0.270, P ≤ 0.0001, n?=?228), respectively. When compared to non-smokers, smokers were younger (P ≤ 0.0001), and had a significantly lower BMI (P?=?0.001), shorter durations of surgery (P ≤ 0.0001), decreased intraoperative blood loss (P?=?0.022), and shorter hospital stays (P?=?0.006), respectively. Complications occurred in 17 patients (7%) and were not affected by patient age, BMI, hypertension, or active smoking status. Conclusion Minimally invasive spinal surgery is a safe and effective treatment option and may be superior to open surgery in subpopulations with significant co-morbidities and risk factors, such as elderly and obese patients as well as patients with an active smoking status.
