AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the reproductive function of bulls with attention to relevant issues of health. In considering Bull Breeding Soundness Evaluation (BBSE) outcomes, it is important to consider all factors and their interactions, including age and genotype of the bulls and the environment in which they have been raised. There are both positive and negative genetic considerations with regard to bull fertility. Interest in bull sex-drive, or libido, arose from early work in Sweden which showed that this trait had a strong genetic component. Asymmetrical or overgrown claws and swellings over lower limb joints are common abnormalities, and may reflect poor conformation, pathological conditions, or both. The term ?testicular hypoplasia? refers to a relative lack of development of the spermatogenic epithelium. Testicular degeneration may be temporary or permanent, depending on the type and duration of the particular stressor which has caused the problem.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Keloids are disfiguring, proliferative scars that are a pathologic response to cutaneous injury. An organotypic tissue culture system (the Raft model 1?10) was used to investigate the feasibility of using photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an adjunctive therapy to treat keloids following surgical excision. The Raft co-culture system mimics skin by layering keratinocytes on top of fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. PDT uses drugs that produce singlet oxygen in situ when irradiated by light, and may lead to a number of effects in living tissues varying from the modulation of growth to apoptosis. PDT is already used to treat several benign and malignant diseases in organs such as the skin, retina, and esophagus. Study Design/Materials and Methods Normal adult, neonatal, and keloid fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from skin obtained from patients undergoing elective procedures and used to construct the Rafts. Mature Rafts (after 4 days) were incubated with 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA), a photosensitizer, for 3 hours and were laser-irradiated (635 nm) for total energy delivery of 5 J/cm2, 10 J/cm2, or 20 J/cm2. Rafts were examined 24 hours and 14 days later. Cell viability was determined using confocal imaging combined with live-dead fluorescent dyes. Multi-photon microscope (MPM) imaged collagen structure and density. As Rafts contract over time, surface area was measured using optical micrometry daily. Results At 10 and 20 J/cm2, near-total cell death was observed in all constructs, while at 5 J/cm2 cell viability was comparable to controls. Cell viability in keloid and neonatal Rafts was greater than that observed in normal adult Rafts. Treated Rafts contracted less over the 14-day period compared to controls. Contraction and collagen density were greatest in keloid and neonatal Rafts. Conclusions A PDT dosimetry range was established, which reduces tissue contraction and collagen density while minimizing injury to fibroblasts. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Cytopathology, a branch of diagnostic pathology provides an alternative to histopathological examination and has several advantages. Specimen collection is relatively simple and quick, is much less invasive (does not require surgery) and processing is much faster that of the paraffin wax embedding method employed in routine histopathology. This chapter introduces the reader to the techniques employed in the Cytopathology laboratory from specimen collection and preparation to diagnosis. The fundamentals of cytomorphology and cytodiagnosis are described in brief. The history of the cervical screening programme is covered, from its introduction, through the limitations of specimen collection, the Papnicolaou (Pap) smear, via the pivotal role played by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in the progression to cervical cancer, to the introduction of Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) and the new HPV vaccine reaching market.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mid-term radiographic and functional outcomes of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) patients treated with the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) technique and to find predictive factors of clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective, single-center study was performed enrolling a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of TPF. All subjects were treated by ORIF between January 2010 and December 2015 at our level-1 healthcare trauma center. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 75?years; ORIF technique used for articular TPF, type 41-B and 41-C, isolated or with associated injuries. The patients were divided in two groups, according to fracture patterns and compared. Their characteristics, radiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Radiographs 12?months after surgery were evaluated for reduction and alignment, and radiographs at 24?months to describe post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and the American Knee Society score (AKSS) questionnaires. Return to work and sport activities were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, and the statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P <?0.05. Results Forty-five patients were included, 29 males and 16 females; the mean age was 54.5?years. The mean follow-up was 57.18?months (range, 26?94). There were AO 41-B fractures (partial articular fractures) in more than half of the patients (66.67%), while the remaining 15 had AO 41-C fractures (complete articular fractures). The sub-type AO 41-B3 was the most common, reported in 62.22% of patients. The mean KOOS score was 69.0. Mean AKSS and SF-36 PCS scores were 79.0 and 41.4, respectively. There were significant relationships between age and functional results (KOOS ADL, Sport, QoL, and SF-36 PCS) and between BMI and KOOS Pain, ADL, Sport, and QoL. No differences were found between the two types of fractures regarding quality of reduction and alignment. AO 41-C TPF tend to develop PTOA more frequently with respect to 41-B fractures, while type AO 41-C TPF had the worst clinical outcomes. We found that the presence of an articular step-off and the malalignment of the tibial axis after surgery were predictive of daily pain felt by patients. PTOA was predictive of a worse AKSS. The overall complication rate was 13.33%: 1 superficial wound infection, 1 deep vein thrombosis, and 4 cases of transitory deficit of the common peroneal nerve. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that early radiographic features may be predictive for pain perceived by patients at mid-term follow-up.

AB  - Objective This article provides an introduction to the special issue on college student mental health. It gives an overview of the establishment of the Multi-Site University Study of Identity and Culture (MUSIC) collaborative by a group of national experts on culture and identity. Information about the procedures used to collect a nationally represented sample of college students are provided. Method Data were collected from 30 university sites across the United States. The sample comprised 10,573 undergraduate college students, of which 73% were women, 63% White, 9% African American/Black, 14% Latino/Hispanic, 13% Asian American, and 1% Other. Results The special issue comprises a compilation of 8 studies that used the dataset specifically created to examine the issues of emerging adults, culture, and identity. Conclusions Student mental health problems are a growing concern on college campuses. Studies covered in this special issue have implications for policy development regarding college alcohol use and traumatic victimization, include attention to underrepresented minority and immigrant groups on college campuses, and focus on positive as well as pathological aspects of the college experience.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Abstract? It was examined whether bulimia and dissociation are common in male self-cutters, as has been found in female self-cutters. The subjects were 796 male inmates of a juvenile prison. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to assess self-cutting, histories of psychoactive substance use, problem behaviors, and traumatic life events in the subjects. The Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale and the Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh were also used. Subjects were divided into two groups: self-cutting and non-cutting. Questionnaire responses and dissociation and bulimia assessments were compared between the groups. Self-cutters began smoking (P?<?0.001) and drinking (P?<?0.001) earlier, and more frequently used illicit psychoactive drugs (P?<?0.001), experienced childhood physical abuse (P?<?0.001), and reported suicide attempts (P?<?0.001), suicidal ideation (P?<?0.001), and outward violence toward a person (P?<?0.001) or object (P?<?0.001) than non-cutters. Self-cutters also scored significantly higher on the bulimia (P?<?0.001) and dissociation tests (P?<?0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that suicide attempt (odds ratio, 4.311) and suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 2.336) could discriminate between male inmates with and without self-cutting. Male self-cutters showed ?multi-impulsive bulimic? tendencies resembling those of female self-cutters, although to a lesser extent. Clinical features of male as opposed to female self-cutters were influenced by gender differences.

AB  - Objective To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. Methods Cognitive and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged?≥?65 years (n?=?23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n?=?69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n?=?23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio?≥?1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios?=?0.95?±?0.15, 1.11?±?0.18 [p?<?0.0001], and 1.14?±?0.17 [p?=?0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74?83.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the pedagogical advantages and disadvantages of the use of virtual tools in the anatomy laboratory environment for forensic science education. Teaching pathology and forensic pathology is an essential aspect in the forensic science curriculum and yet it is not widely taught in the United Kingdom. With the emerging presence of IT based technologies in medical education, virtual anatomy has become an integral part of not only medical training but also the broader realm of healthcare. In particular, these virtual anatomy technologies look to address the difficulties associated with cadaver preparation and usage. Virtual anatomy products provide reusable and accessible resources to students and instructors for viewing and discussing the same detailed structures. Like other virtual anatomy products, the Anatomage Table provides tools for educational programmes looking to supplement or substitute cadaver usage. In addition to general gross anatomy application, users can utilise virtual anatomy for advanced clinical or procedural training.

AB  - Summary Myeloma is one of the most common malignancies that results in osteolytic lesions of the spine. Complications, including pathological fractures of the vertebrae and spinal cord compression, may cause severe pain, deformity and neurological sequelae. They may also have significant consequences for quality of life and prognosis for patients. For patients with known or newly diagnosed myeloma presenting with persistent back or radicular pain/weakness, early diagnosis of spinal myeloma disease is therefore essential to treat and prevent further deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging is the initial imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of spinal disease. Treatment of the underlying malignancy with systemic chemotherapy together with supportive bisphosphonate treatment reduces further vertebral damage. Additional interventions such as cement augmentation, radiotherapy, or surgery are often necessary to prevent, treat and control spinal complications. However, optimal management is dependent on the individual nature of the spinal involvement and requires careful assessment and appropriate intervention throughout. This article reviews the treatment and management options for spinal myeloma disease and highlights the value of defined pathways to enable the proper management of patients affected by it.

AB  - Summary Parkinson's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal and other neuronal networks caused by cell loss in the substantia nigra and many other neuronal systems, associated with widespread occurrence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neurites mainly containing phosphorylated α-synuclein. The resulting striatal dopamine deficiency and other biochemical deficits cause the clinical picture of this multisystem disorder. For the diagnosis of definite Parkinson's disease, histopathological confirmation is required. The etiology of Parkinson's disease remains still elusive, but a complex combination of environmental factors, intrinsic cellular metabolic properties and susceptible genetic alleles has been assumed, and important genetic and pathological clues have been found. Two forms of Parkinson's disease are recognized: a ?familial? or early-onset Parkinson's disease (<10% of all patients) in which gene mutations have been identified, and a sporadic late-onset Parkinson's disease (>85%) that does not appear to exhibit heredity, but familial components suggest genetic factors. Although genetic and experimental models have contributed to explore the pathomechanisms and treatment options of Parkinson's disease, there is still no optimal animal model of the disease, and the etiology of Parkinson's disease is still far from being elucidated.

AB  - An 11-year-old male Belgian shepherd dog was evaluated for a one-week history of progressive lethargy, decreased appetite and excessive panting. On physical examination, a pedunculated mass protruding from the right side of the tongue base was observed. The mass was solid, irregular and multi-lobulated, and it measured approximately 4?2 cm. The mass was surgically excised. The histological examination was consistent with a lingual osteoma and the margins were free of neoplastic cells. The dog was euthanased eight months after the diagnosis because of an unrelated problem and no evidence of recurrence at the surgical site was appreciated at that time. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of a lingual osteoma in a dog, and, therefore, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of masses on the tongue, especially pedunculated masses located at the base of the tongue.

Multi-drug resistant strains of this pathogen are the cause of considerable problems in human hospitals and for community healthcare professionals worldwide. The potential for a similar impact within veterinary medicine is discussed.

AB  - Of all spontaneous tendon ruptures, complete Achilles tendon tears are most closely associated with sports activities (1?3). Schönbauer (3) reported that 75% of all ruptures of the Achilles tendon are related to sports. In Plecko  and in North America, football, basketball, baseball, tennis and downhill skiing dominate the statistics (1, 2, 4). In sports, some Achilles ruptures are not spontaneous or degeneration-induced but may occur as a consequence of the remarkably high forces that are involved in the performance (2). Ruptures in the high jump or triple jump are good examples. In such cases, failure in the neuromuscular protective mechanisms due to fatigue or disturbed co-ordination can frequently be found. The spontaneous complete rupture of the supraspinatus tendon of the rotator cuff does not occur very frequently in sports. Those sports that include high-energy throwing movements, such as American and Finnish baseball, American football, rugby and discus and javelin throwing, may, however, produce this injury. Partial tears and inflammations of the rotator cuff complex are much more frequent in throwing sports. The complete rupture of the proximal long head of the biceps brachii tendon is rare among competitive and recreational athletes. In our material, under 2% of these ruptures were associated with sports activities (5). The rupture (avulsion) of the distal tendon of the biceps muscle is rare. In sports, gymnastics, body building and weight lifting have been said to be able to produce this injury (6). In general, complete ruptures of the quadriceps tendon and the patellar tendon occur most often in older individuals. In our study, the mean age of these patients was 65 years (5). However, these injuries do also occur in younger age groups, especially in athletes. In athletes, the rupture most frequently occurs in high-power sports events, such as high jump, basketball and weight lifting, at the age of 15-30 years. A chronic patellar apicitis (jumper's knee) may predispose rupture of the tendon (7). As is the case with the rotator cuff complex, overuse inflammation and partial tears of the quadriceps and patellar tendons are one of the most characteristic athletic injuries. Complete spontaneous ruptures of other tendons in sports are rare, although the literature does provide case studies from almost every tendon the human body possesses (8?18).

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Summary Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and injury and are critical for antimicrobial host defense. Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract Sudden cardiac death is a significant cause of mortality in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office database was queried for cases of CHD as a cause of death in the period between July 2008 and April 2019. Twenty-two cases were identified, including 11 decedents with simple defects and 10 decedents with complex defects. All of the subjects were in apparent good health at the time of death. In the absence of other obvious causes of death, simple defects were considered cases of sudden cardiac death. Significant cardiac morphological changes were common in complex defects. While 16 cases had known, diagnosed/treated CHD, 5 cases had no diagnosis prior to autopsy. In these cases, the ability to recognize CHD (sometimes subtle) helped in determining the causes of death. Therefore, forensic pathologists must be able to properly recognize various forms of CHD and request consultations, when needed.
