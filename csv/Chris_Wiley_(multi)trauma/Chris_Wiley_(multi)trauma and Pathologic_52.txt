AB  - Abstract Downstream passage of European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) in catchments with pump(s) for water level management is a major concern. Catchment-wide acoustic telemetry revealed silver eels quickly migrated downstream through unobstructed reaches (n = 12; mean ± SD = 17.9 ± 1.9 km/day). Fourteen of 17 acoustic-tagged eels detected at the pumping station (82.1%) retreated back upstream and ten (58.8%) passed through pumps after delays (9.5 ± 11.0 days). Multi-beam sonar imaging across the intake screen (55-mm gaps) revealed that peaks in migration occurred during the nights preceding the new moon but 76.7% retreated back upstream. All passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged eels recaptured (n = 56) downstream of a large (2.23-m diameter) mixed flow pump survived but 96.5% had minor injuries, reduced physical condition and/or abnormal behaviour. By contrast, 64.7% of PIT-tagged eels recaptured (n = 17) downstream of a small (0.8-m diameter) axial flow pump died. No acoustic-tagged eels that passed through the small axial flow pump (n = 10) performed onward migration at sea, unlike ?control? eels released downstream (n = 11). This evidence may help develop effective remediation measures, such as operational changes, to maximise escapement of catadromous eel species at pumping stations.

AB  - Because there have been few comprehensive histopathologic studies of meningomyeloceles and related malformations, we undertook a systematic study of these lesions. One hundred and thirty two cases were obtained from our surgical pathology files; these included 38 meningoceles, 71 meningomyeloceles, and 23 encephaloceles. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin; special stains included trichrome, alcian blue, Fontana-Masson, Nissl, Holzer, and immunoperoxidase for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Epithelial changes included ulceration, atrophy, or nevoid hyperplasia of the epidermis, and loss of appendages. Mesodermal features included fibrous zones resembling dura, subarachnoid tissue or scar (99% of cases), increased numbers of blood vessels (83%), hypertrophy of arrector pili muscle (42%), lipoma formation (38%), and immature skeletal muscle fibers (5%) that rarely intermingled with neuropil-like matrix. The latter tissue was identified in 71% of cases and included neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and ependyma. Forty-eight percent of cases included peripheral nerve fibers or roots, and some fibers formed onion bulb or Pacinian corpuscle-like structures. Meningothelial cells were observed in 26% of cases and sometimes formed recognizable whorls. Choroid plexus was noted in 3 cases, one example showing an unusual dystrophic calcification that formed long parallel spicules. Pigmented dendritic cells were observed within zones of fibrous tissue in 10% of cases. These malformations involve complex arrangements of cutaneous, neuroectodermal, and mesodermal elements. Because they may be encountered by dermatopathologists, familiarity with the microscopic features of dysraphic lesions is essential.

AB  - Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) refers to ongoing pain felt in the bones, joints and tissues of the body that persists longer than 3 months. For these conditions, it is widely accepted that secondary pathologies or the consequences of persistent pain, including fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and nervous system sensitization appear to be the main contributors to pain and disability. While exercise is a primary treatment modality for CMP, the intent is often to improve physical function with less attention to secondary pathologies. Exercise interventions for CMP which address secondary pathologies align with contemporary pain rehabilitation practices and have greater potential to improve patient outcomes above exercise alone. Biopsychosocial treatment which acknowledges and addresses the biological, psychological and social contributions to pain and disability is currently seen as the most efficacious approach to chronic pain. This clinical update discusses key aspects of a biopsychosocial approach concerning exercise prescription for CMP and considers both patient needs and clinician competencies. There is consensus for individualized, supervised exercise based on patient presentation, goals and preference that is perceived as safe and non-threatening to avoid fostering unhelpful associations between physical activity and pain. The weight of evidence supporting exercise for CMP has been provided by aerobic and resistance exercise studies, although there is considerable uncertainty on how to best apply the findings to exercise prescription. In this clinical update, we also provide evidence-based guidance on exercise prescription for CMP through a synthesis of published work within the field of exercise and CMP rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - Abstract Tendon injury repairs are big challenges in sports medicine, and fatty infiltration after tendon injury is very common and hampers tendon injury healing process. Tendon stem cells (TSCs), as precursors of tendon cells, have shown promising effect on injury tendon repair for their tenogenesis and tendon extracellular matrix formation. Adipocytes and lipids accumulation is a landmark event in pathological process of tendon injury, and this may induce tendon rupture in clinical practice. Based on this, it is important to inhibit TSCs adipogenesis and lipids infiltration to restore structure and function of injury tendon. Aspirin, as the representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has been widely used in tendon injury for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, but effect of aspirin on TSCs adipogenesis and fatty infiltration is still unclear. Under adipogenesis conditions, TSCs were treated with concentration gradient of aspirin. Oil red O staining was performed to observe changes of lipids accumulation. Next, we used RNA sequencing to compare profile changes of gene expression between induction group and aspirin-treated group. Then, we verified the effect of filtrated signalling on TSCs adipogenesis. At last, we established rat tendon injury model and compared changes of biomechanical properties after aspirin treatment. The results showed that aspirin decreased lipids accumulation in injury tendon and inhibited TSCs adipogenesis. RNA sequencing filtrated PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling as our target. After adding the signalling activators of VO-Ohpic and IGF-1, inhibited adipogenesis of TSCs was reversed. Still, aspirin promoted maximum loading, ultimate stress and breaking elongation of injury tendon. In conclusion, by down-regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling, aspirin inhibited adipogenesis of TSCs and fatty infiltration in injury tendon, promoted biomechanical properties and decreased rupture risk of injury tendon. All these provided new therapeutic potential and medicine evidence of aspirin in treating tendon injury and tendinopathy.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript constitutes a review of several innovative biomedical technologies fabricated using the precision and accuracy of silicon micro- and nanofabrication. The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to assess the frequency of localised primary canine hypoplasia (LHPC) in a sample of 24 subadults from a Neolithic cemetery assemblage located at Man Bac, northern Vietnam (~4000?3500?years BP), and explore the range of factors potentially contributing to the development of this condition. It is found that 41.7% of individuals (20.9% of primary canines) have LHPC, which is similar to the frequency reported in a suite of ancient cemetery series from Neolithic through to Metal Age Thailand. A range of competing aetiological factors considered included trauma to the deciduous canine, ostensibly by way of early childhood exploratory behaviours (e.g. ?mouthing? objects), nutritional and dietary deficiencies (especially vitamin A and D), the impact of the mother's health on the developing foetus as well as the effects of premature birth on the developing child. It is concluded that while the aetiology LHPC is multi-factorial, the reasonably high prevalence of this condition at Man Bac suggests depressed maternal and neonatal health, consistent with a community experiencing high rates of fertility and transitioning to an agricultural subsistence economy.

AB  - Abstract Using a spleen autotransplantation model, we conducted hematological, hemorheological, immunological, and morphological studies in mice 6 weeks after splenectomy. Sixty male and female A/J inbred mice were equally divided into 3 groups: 1) SE group, splenectomy was performed; 2) AU group, spleen chips were autotransplanted into the omentum without vascular anastomosis following splenectomy; and 3) C group (controls), no intervention in these mice. At postoperative week 6, the following studies were performed: 1) measurement of hematological parameters; 2) hemorheological studies, including relative cell transit time (RCTT) and fibrinogen levels; and 3) activity of peripheral phagocytes, measured by zymozan-induced chemiluminescence, which was calculated in stimulation index values (SI). In addition, histological investigations of autotransplants were conducted. Erythrocyte mean cell volume and platelet counts, RCTT, fibrinogen levels, and activity of phagocytes were significantly higher in the SE group, compared to those in the C group. In the AU group, these parameters were similar to those in the C group. Morphologically, the transplanted spleen showed normal histology. These data indicate that the transplanted spleens restored their function. We conclude that spleen autotransplantation reserves the normal morphology of spleen and restores most of the spleen's hematological, hemorheological, and immunological functions. Both SI index and erythrocyte deformability can be an informative detection of decreasing splenic function. These data suggest that spleen autotransplantation may provide a useful tool to prevent complications following splenectomy in a clinical setting. Lép autotransplantatios egér modellen a 6. posztoperatív héten haematologiai, haemorheologiai, immunologiai és morphologiai vizsgálatokat végeztünk splenectomiát követ?en.

A 6. posztoperatív héten 1) haematologiai paraméterek meghatározása, 2) a haemorheologiai vizsgálatként a vörösvérsejt deformabilitás mérése (relatív sejttranzit-id?, RCTT), a fibrinogén szint meghatározása történt, 3) immunologiai mérömódszerként a perifériás phagocyták aktivitását zymosan függ? chemiluminescentiával mértük, a stimulációs index (SI) számításával. Párhuzamosan az autotransplantált lép-chipek szövettani értékelését is elvégeztük. Az erythrocyták átlagos térfogata és a thrombocyták száma, az RCTT és a fibrinogén szint, valamint a phagocyták aktivitása szignifikánsan nagyobb volt az SE, mint a C csoportban. Ezek a paraméterek az AU csoportban hasonlóak voltak a C csoport értékeihez. Az autotransplantált lépek normális histologiájú képet mutattak. Eredményeink azt sugallják, hogy a transplantalt lép-chipek funkciója helyreállt. Kísérleteink alapján úgy t?nik, hogy a lép autotransplantatio meg?rzi a lépszövet normál morphologiáját, nagyrészt helyreállítja a haematologiai, haemorheologiai és immunologiai funkciókat. A lépfunkció csökkenésének érzékeny jelz?je lehet az SI és a vörösvérsejt deformabilitás értékeinek változása. Adataink szerint a lépautotransplantatio hatékony eszköz lehet a splenctomiákat követ? komplikációk megel?zésében a klinikai gyakorlatban is. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 23:483?488 2003

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

It considers the types of study published (case, population or method), whether findings are integrated with other data, the particular ?theme? that is considered (diet, activity patterns, etc) and the particular pathological condition focused upon (metabolic, dental, etc). The findings show there is a move away from the traditional case study and an increase in the acknowledgement of the value of integrating data with wider information. There is also a bias towards certain ?themes? and pathologies, reasons for which are discussed. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The Myanmar Ministry of Health has formed a partnership with Australasian professional colleges and international medical specialists to deliver a comprehensive programme for emergency care training and development. We describe this programme, emphasising the training of the first emergency specialists for Myanmar. Methods Eighteen junior specialists (EM18) joined a new postgraduate diploma in emergency medicine (Dip EM) through the University of Medicine (1) (UM1), Yangon. Diploma content included an introductory course, clinical rotations, 2 months in the emergency receiving centre (ERC) of the Yangon General Hospital (YGH) supervised by a volunteer Australasian emergency physician (FACEM), several short courses and an educational visit to Hong Kong. Curriculum and assessments comprising written and oral exams were devised and delivered by volunteer FACEMs and Hong Kong specialists. Results All EM18 completed the 18 month programme and passed the final assessments to graduate in February 2014. Course strengths included the supervised clinical rotation to the ERC and short course teaching on emergency medical, surgical, trauma, paediatric and disaster topics. The educational visit to Hong Kong enabled the EM18 to visualise more advanced EM systems that could be adapted to the Myanmar context. The participating international clinicians provided expert strategic advice on ED design, staffing, equipment, nursing and pre-hospital systems to leaders within universities, hospitals and the Ministry of Health. Conclusion The first Myanmar postgraduate diploma in EM provides an example of collaborative and responsive clinical health capacity building in a context of very limited resources.

AB  - Spindle cell lipoma is a neoplasm of adipose tissue that primarily affects posterior necks and shoulders of men in their fifth to seventh decades. It consists of a mixture of adipose tissue and spindle-shaped cells that could be misinterpreted as sarcoma. A clinical and pathological study of two patients, both men, with vascular variants of spindle cell lipoma is presented. These tumors were unusual clinically, in that one caused pain on motion and the other was painful to palpation. On microscopic examination, their vascularity was augmented over previously described examples of spindle cell lipoma.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 116, 796?805. Abstract ATP is a widespread and multipurpose signalling molecule copiously released in the extracellular environment of the whole nervous system upon cell activation, stress, or damage. Extracellular ATP is also a multidirectional information molecule, given the concurrent presence at the plasma membrane of various targets for ATP. These include ectonucleotidases (metabolizing ATP down to adenosine), ATP/adenosine transporters, P2 receptors for purine/pyrimidine nucleotides (ligand-gated ion channels P2X receptors and G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors), in addition to metabotropic P1 receptors for nucleosides. All these targets rarely operate as single units, rather they associate with each other at the plasma membrane as multi-protein complexes. Altogether, they control the duration, magnitude and/or direction of the signals triggered and propagated by purine/pyrimidine ligands, and the impact that each single ligand has on a variety of short- and long-term functions. A strict control system allows assorted, even divergent, biological outcomes. Among these, we enumerate cell-to-cell communication, tropic, trophic, but also noxious actions causing the insurgence/progression of pathological conditions. Here, we show that purinergic signalling in the nervous system can be instrumental for instance to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.
