AB  - Abstract Objectives The Myanmar Ministry of Health has formed a partnership with Australasian professional colleges and international medical specialists to deliver a comprehensive programme for emergency care training and development. We describe this programme, emphasising the training of the first emergency specialists for Myanmar. Methods Eighteen junior specialists (EM18) joined a new postgraduate diploma in emergency medicine (Dip EM) through the University of Medicine (1) (UM1), Yangon. Diploma content included an introductory course, clinical rotations, 2 months in the emergency receiving centre (ERC) of the Yangon General Hospital (YGH) supervised by a volunteer Australasian emergency physician (FACEM), several short courses and an educational visit to Hong Kong. Curriculum and assessments comprising written and oral exams were devised and delivered by volunteer FACEMs and Hong Kong specialists. Results All EM18 completed the 18 month programme and passed the final assessments to graduate in February 2014. Course strengths included the supervised clinical rotation to the ERC and short course teaching on emergency medical, surgical, trauma, paediatric and disaster topics. The educational visit to Hong Kong enabled the EM18 to visualise more advanced EM systems that could be adapted to the Myanmar context. The participating international clinicians provided expert strategic advice on ED design, staffing, equipment, nursing and pre-hospital systems to leaders within universities, hospitals and the Ministry of Health. Conclusion The first Myanmar postgraduate diploma in EM provides an example of collaborative and responsive clinical health capacity building in a context of very limited resources.

AB  - Abstract Death due to accidental primary hypothermia in cold climates is relatively common, with previous case series reflecting this. In contrast, hypothermia-related death as a result of an underlying medical cause, such as a brain tumor, is rare. The literature clearly illustrates a theoretical causal relationship between brain neoplasms and hypothermia through the infiltration of the hypothalamus; however, the number of reported cases is minimal. Two cases are presented where autopsy confirmed hypothermia as the cause of death with both cases revealing widespread glioblastoma multiforme in the brain. Both decedents were elderly with a number of comorbidities identified during autopsy that could explain death; however, hypothermia was deemed the most likely cause. It is proposed that both decedents died of hypothermia as a result of the tumor's effect on thermoregulation. These cases underline the importance of forensic pathologists to be aware of the relationship between brain tumors and hypothermia and to not dismiss death as being due to other disease processes.

AB  - Abstract Recently there has been an increase in interest in the relationship between stress and memory. Brain regions which are involved in memory function also effect the stress response. Traumatic stress results in changes in these brain regions; alterations in these brain regions in turn may mediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural mechanisms which are relevant to the effects of stress on memory, such as fear conditioning, stress sensitization, and extinction, are reviewed in relation to their implications for PTSD. Special topics including neural mechanisms in dissociation, neurobiological approaches to the validity of childhood memories as they apply to controversies over the ?False Memory Syndrome,? and implications of the effects of stress on memory for psychotherapy, are also reviewed. The findings discussed in this paper are consistent with the formulation that stress-induced alterations in brain regions and systems involved in memory may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD, as well as dissociative amnesia, seen in survivors of traumatic stress.

AB  - A growing perception in endodontic circles is that root canal therapy requires one treatment visit only. One-visit endodontics offers many potential advantages. It is less time-consuming, resulting in less cost for the patient, potentially more profit for the dentist, less painful and less traumatic than multi-visit treatment. Conversely, if the pulp is necrotic and/or associated with periradicular disease, the root canal system is infected. In these cases, the root canal system should ideally be cleaned, an intracanal medication placed, and the canal filled at a second visit. In this paper we aim to review several aspects of one-visit versus multi-visit endodontic treatment and future perspectives in this field.

Material and Methods A total of 53 patients, with 57 suspicious facial lesions, participated in this study. A set of variables have been highlighted by the pathologist to represent the minimum unique features that could be used to diagnose a skin pathology have been included in a checklist. One pathologist used this checklist while examining the histopathology slides and one clinician while examining the OCT images. The data from both checklists have been reviewed and compared. Results Optical coherence tomography's overall accuracy in diagnosing AK was 83%. Best accuracy was achieved in diagnosing BCC and was 97%, while it was 85% for cutaneous SCC. OCT failed to diagnose LM with an accuracy of 33.3% based on the two parameters of the pathology checklist, while it was 81% for malignant melanoma. Conclusion This study proved the success of OCT in identifying structural changes in normal and pathological facial skin. Further studies to prove its usefulness in vivo are recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the nature of multinucleated and mononuclear cells from peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 cases of PGCG were immunohistochemically stained for vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin, CD68, S-100 protein, lysozyme. leucocyte common antigen (LCA), factor VIII-retated antigen and muscle cell actin. Six cases of PGCG were also studied by transmission etectron microscopy. RESULTS: Vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin and CD68 were expressed in both the mononuclear and multinucleated giant cells. Dendritic mononuclear cells, positive for 5?100 protein, were noted in 67.5% of the lesions, whereas lysozyme and leucocyte common antigen were detected in occasional mononuclear cells. Ultrastructural examination showed mononuclear cells with signs of phagocytosis and sometimes interdigitations with similar cells. Others presented non-specific characteristics and the third type exhibited cytoplasmic processes and occasional Birbeck granules. Some multi-nucleated giant cells showed oval nuclei, abundant mitochondria and granular endoplasmic reticulum whereas others presented with irregular nuclei and a great number of cytoplasmic vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: lmmunohistochemical and ultrastructural results suggest that PGCGs of the jaws are composed mainly of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and that Langerhans cells are present in two thirds of the lesions.

AB  - Objective To report outcomes in dogs with distal radial osteosarcoma (OSA) treated with metal endoprosthesis limb-sparing surgery and compare outcomes between 2 generations of endoprosthesis. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Forty-five dogs with distal radial OSA treated with endoprosthesis and chemotherapy. Methods Data of dogs treated with either first-generation endoprosthesis (GEN1) or second-generation endoprosthesis (GEN2) were sourced from medical records and radiographs. Surgical outcomes included postoperative lameness assessment and the presence, severity, and time to onset of complications. Oncologic outcomes included presence of local recurrence or metastasis, time to onset of local recurrence, metastasis-free interval (MFI), and survival time. Results for surgical and oncologic outcomes were compared between GEN1 and GEN2. Results Twenty-eight dogs received GEN1 and 17 dogs received GEN2. There were 39 complications (96%, 14 minor, 29 major) including infection (78%), implant-related complication (36%), and local recurrence (24%). Metastatic frequency was 67% and median MFI was 188 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 126?250 days). Survival time ranged from 34 days to 6.1 years with a median of 289 days (95% CI: 207?371 days). There was no significant difference in complication severity, frequency, time to complication, MFI, or survival time between dogs receiving GEN1 and GEN2. Conclusion There was no significant difference in outcomes between dogs receiving GEN1 and GEN2 for limb-sparing surgery of the radius. Metastatic frequency and survival time for metal endoprosthesis were similar to that of amputation with curative intent chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract:? Imaging is an integral diagnostic tool in mass fatality investigations undertaken traditionally by plain X-rays, fluoroscopy, and dental radiography. However, little attention has been given to appropriate image reporting, secure data transfer and storage particularly in relation to the need to meet stringent judicial requirements. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is the risk associated with the safe handling and investigation of contaminated fatalities which is providing new challenges for mass fatality radiological imaging. Mobile multi-slice computed tomography is an alternative to these traditional modalities as it provides a greater diagnostic yield and an opportunity to address the requirements of the criminal justice system. We present a new national disaster victim/forensic identification imaging system?Fimag?which is applicable for both contaminated and non-contaminated mass fatality imaging and addresses the issues of judicial reporting. We suggest this system opens a new era in radiological diagnostics for mass fatalities.

AB  - Summary The practice of war surgery has a longstanding relationship with the speciality of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The relationship has often fostered new and often ground-breaking developments in medicine and surgery. The last decade of conflict has been no different. Understanding the history and principles of war surgery is paramount to its practice. This chapter aims to distil the salient practices learnt from recent conflicts through understanding of what wounds soldiers at war and the compounding factors that make surgery more arduous in war conditions. Furthermore, the chapter will give a concise understanding of blast and penetrating injury and develop this in the methods of applying plastic and reconstructive surgery military surgical teams.

AB  - Abstract Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CN) is one of the most challenging foot complications in diabetes. Common predisposing and precipitating factors include neuropathy and increased mechanical forces, fracture and bone resorption, trauma and inflammation. In the last 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the early recognition of the acute Charcot foot when the X ray is still negative (stage 0 or incipient Charcot foot). Recent advances in imaging modalities have enabled the detection of initial signs of inflammation and underlying bone damage before overt bone and joint destruction has occurred. Casting therapy remains the mainstay of medical therapy of acute CN. If timely instituted, offloading can arrest disease activity and prevent foot deformity. In cases with severe deformity, modern surgical techniques can correct the unstable deformity for improved functional outcome and limb survival. Emerging new studies into the cellular mechanisms of severe bone destruction have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms of pathological bone and joint destruction in CN. It is hoped that these studies may provide a scientific basis for new interventions with biological agents. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, indications, potential risks, complications, and expected outcomes of strictures, and procedures for balloon dilation, bougienage and injections and esophageal stenting to treat esophageal obstruction in cats and dogs. Esophageal obstructions can be a result of extraluminal or intraluminal occlusion. Strictures occur secondary to local esophageal injury often associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) or direct damage (esophageal trauma, caustic irritation, post surgical inflammation). Treatment for benign esophageal strictures includes medical management, bougienage, balloon dilation, resection and anastomosis, and salvage esophageal stenting. A subset of strictures is termed refractory benign esophageal strictures (RBES) and recurs despite multiple attempts at dilation. Both balloon dilation and bougienage have been used in animals for the management of benign esophageal strictures. Stents were found to immediately improve the dysphagia score, but were met with some complications, most commonly discomfort from the presence of the stent or chronic esophageal distension.

AB  - Abstract Crisis intervention services are now widely recognized as an efficacious treatment modality for the provision of emergency mental health care to individuals and groups. During the course of a lifetime, all people experience a variety of personal traumas, such as divorce or illness, while many others will also live through cataclysmic events, such as natural disasters or acts of violence, that result in a state of crisis. Although exposure to traumatic stressors can trigger adverse, long-term effects that can become extremely difficult to resolve without the timely delivery of effective, psychological intervention, crisis states can also provide an avenue for personal growth. This chapter presents a summary of the historical highlights and the theoretical influences on the development of modem crisis intervention theory. An overview of solution focused therapy, cognitive therapy, and other useful techniques are presented along with the differences and similarities in the delivery of emergency mental health services to individuals and groups. Case examples are used to illustrate the implementation of specific assessments and interventions in providing crisis intervention services. A general framework for collaborating with law enforcement and other agencies providing emergency care providers is presented. Cultural considerations in the context of a crisis, current research, and relevant legal issues are reviewed.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) changed radically with the advent of Multi Slice CT (MSCT) which enabled necessary technical improvements for the study of blood vessels, particularly arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has some advantages when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MSCT scanners are widely available in places such as emergency rooms and research centers for the diagnosis and research of stroke. Arterial venous malformations, blunt vascular trauma, aneurysms and several other diseases can also be studied with CTA. Since the early 1990's there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications regarding CTA and its widespread use makes it an essential tool in the radiologist's armamentarium.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to examine the difference in the pattern of articular damage in persons with either a partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear; a complete ACL tear or no ACL tear. Methods Our study included 600 individuals (of the 600 individuals, 25 with a partial, 12 with a complete ACL tear and 563 with no ACL tear) from the progression sub-cohort of the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Individuals had a mean age of 61.8 years (range 45?79 years). Chi-square tests were used to compare the location of meniscal pathology, bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and regional cartilage morphology between individuals with a partial or complete ACL tear, as seen on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as to a control group of 563 knees. Results Individuals with either a complete or partial ACL tear displayed predominantly medial tibiofemoral damage. Individuals with complete ACL tears were more likely to have cartilage lesions in the lateral posterior tibia (P = 0.03) and the medial anterior femur (P = 0.008) as well as BMLs in the medial posterior tibia (P = 0.007). However, no significant difference in meniscal morphology was found in either compartment. Individuals with no history of knee trauma or ACL injury displayed predominantly medial tibiofemoral compartment damage. Conclusion Individuals with prevalent ACL disruptions exhibited concomitant osteoarthritic changes in the medial tibiofemoral compartment, as seen on MRI. As the changes in joint tissues were predominantly located in the medial compartment, it is thought that these ACL tears may represent a manifestation of the overall disease process rather than the precipitant for osteoarthritis incidence.
