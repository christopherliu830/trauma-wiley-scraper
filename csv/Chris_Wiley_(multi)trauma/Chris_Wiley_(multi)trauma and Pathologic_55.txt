AB  - Objectives To report the signalment, clinical presentation, treatments pursued and outcomes of dogs with malignant anal sac melanoma. Methods Medical records from five institutions from January 2000 through December 2015 were reviewed and dogs with cytologically- or histologically-confirmed malignant anal sac melanoma were identified. Signalment, clinical signs, staging, cytology, histopathologic analysis, surgical and non-surgical treatments were extracted from the medical records. The referring veterinarians and owners were contacted for follow-up data. Results Eleven dogs were included and survival data was available for all. The most common clinical signs were bloody anal sac discharge and perianal licking. Initial treatments pursued included surgery (n=8), chemotherapy (n=1), and palliative treatment with pain medications and stool softeners (n=2). In an adjuvant setting, melanoma vaccine was pursued following surgery in three dogs and chemotherapy in one dog. Regardless of treatment, progression-free survival (mean 92 · 5?days) and overall survival times (median 107?days) were short. Clinical Significance Dogs in this case series had a guarded to poor prognosis regardless of treatment. Ten of 11 dogs were euthanased due to local or distant disease progression. Only 1 of 11 dogs was alive one year after diagnosis. An understanding of tumour behaviour in this location could lead to improved survival times with earlier diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the surgical technique and evaluate short-term outcome after minimally invasive small intestinal exploration and targeted organ biopsy with a wound retractor device (WRD) in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Forty-two cats. Methods A wound retractor was inserted into the abdomen on the ventral midline through a 2-4 cm incision at the level of the umbilicus. Short segments (6-10 cm long) of intestinal tract were sequentially exteriorized and explored through the WRD. Full thickness, small intestinal biopsies were obtained extracorporeally via the WRD. A commercially available single-port device was inserted through the WRD for laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen. Results The majority of the small intestine could be exteriorized and explored through the WRD. In all cases, full thickness biopsies of the small intestine of diagnostic quality were obtained. The most common histological findings were inflammatory bowel disease (n?=?16), intestinal lymphoma (n?=?14), and eosinophilic enteritis (n?=?7). Two cases required conversion to a traditional open laparotomy due to abdominal pathology diagnosed after placement of the WRD (abdominal adhesions and need for a splenectomy). Postoperative complications occurred in 4 of 39 cats (10.3%), leading to 2 deaths after discharge from the hospital. Conclusions and clinical relevance MISIETB with a WRD alone or combined with laparoscopy is a safe technique for small intestinal exploration and targeted abdominal organ biopsy in cats. Single-port laparoscopy can effectively be performed through the WRD for complete abdominal exploration and biopsy of abdominal organs.

Single lung transplantation and fatal fat embolism acquired from the donor: management and literature review.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 133?138. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Fat embolism (FE) is a consequence of skeletal trauma that occurs in more than 90% of cases of severe trauma. However, most of these emboli are clinically insignificant. We report the case of a 59-yr-old man with massive progressive fibrosis who died from widespread FE after a single-lung transplantation (SLT). The lung donor was a 22-yr-old woman who died from traumatic cerebral injury. She had sustained a closed fracture of the tibia, fibula and pelvis. The PaO2/FiO2 before procurement was 452?mmHg. A left SLT using cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. In the immediate postoperative period, profound pulmonary edema in the transplanted lung developed, with overinflation of the native lung and systemic hypotension. Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) was suspected and nitric oxide (NO) and independent lung ventilation (ILV) initiated. Over the next 24?h the patient?s condition deteriorated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. The patient died 45?h after transplantation as cardiovascular and respiratory function continued to decline and massive thoracic bleeding secondary to coagulopathy appeared. Post-mortem examination revealed both massive FE in the non-transplanted donor lung and in the allograft lung. Only two previous cases of donor-acquired FE and PGD after lung transplantation (LT) have been reported. Occult pulmonary FE in a traumatized donor should be considered a cause of PGD.

AB  - Summary Thoracic surgery addresses the operative repair of the chest wall and organs within the chest cavity (principally the lungs and oesophagus) exclusive of the heart and great vessels. Common surgical conditions include chest trauma, chest wall deformities and tumours, pleural effusion and empyema, pneumothorax, gastro-oesophageal reflux and oesophageal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and mediastinal tumours. Minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS) or open thoracotomy may be employed to access and/or remove the pathology. Surgery is very effective in managing the majority of these conditions and patients with malignant tumours may receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as an adjuvant or definitive therapy depending on tumour staging.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Objective To critically evaluate whether open fracture fixation is a significant risk factor for latent osteosarcoma development. Study Design Case?control study. Sample Population Dogs undergoing open fracture repair and dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Methods Records were retrieved from the Veterinary Medical Database VMDB (1970?2000) for dogs undergoing surgical repair of a fracture and dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Dogs with open reduction of joint luxation, dogs diagnosed with bacterial cystitis, and dogs diagnosed with urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma (UBTCC) were queried as comparison populations. Relative risk for osteosarcoma development was determined. Results From a population of 19,041 fractures treated surgically, 15 of those dogs subsequently appeared in the VMDB with osteosarcoma affecting the same bone. The relative risk of a fracture repair and associated orthopedic implants and osteosarcoma occurrence was equivalent to the relative risk of open joint reduction and osteosarcoma occurrence (95% confidence interval; 0.998?1.00). The relative risk of having bacterial cystitis and appearing again in the VMDB with UBTCC was higher than the risk of open fracture repair and a subsequent diagnosis of osteosarcoma (P?<?.02). Conclusion The incidence of fracture-related osteosarcoma may be significantly less than previously estimated based on cases queried from the VMDB. Although possible cases of implant-associated osteosarcoma were identified, their occurrence was rare. Elective implant removal for the purpose of reducing the risk of osteosarcoma after fracture repair may not be warranted and merits further investigation.

AB  - Summary Background Suspensory ligament branch injuries are common in horses. Most of these injuries are grouped together and considered as a single pathologic entity. Objectives To report a specific injury of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches and to report its surgical management and outcome. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods All horses with suspensory ligament branch injuries over a 9-year period (2007?2015) were identified. Horses with injuries which, on ultrasonographic examination, appeared to have defects in the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch, that were subsequently confirmed during surgery were selected. Results Twenty-nine cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a specific lesion location on the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch. Nineteen horses raced successfully after surgery, nine returned to training but failed to race and one was lost to follow-up. Main limitations The absence of a comparable population of non-surgically managed horses in this study means that the contribution of removing torn tissue cannot confidently be assessed. Conclusions The location and morphology of injuries described in this study is consistent, which suggests aetiopathogenic commonality. This case series suggests this type of injury has an identity of its own, differs from other types of suspensory ligament branch injuries and represents a previously undescribed subgroup.

AB  - Objective To understand the role of angiogenesis and hypoxia in cancer progression of primary oral melanoma (POM). Materials and Methods Sixteen malignant primary melanomas were immunostained with markers CD34, VEGF and HIF-1α. Stained cells were counted in the invasive front and inside the tumour, and the differences were compared and correlated with histological parameters and disease-specific survival of the patients. Results Tumour invasive front showed increased MVD and increased vessel VEGF and HIF-1α expression compared with the intratumoural compartment. No such differences were seen in tumoural melanocytes of the two compartments. Positive correlations were observed between CD34 and VEGF, CD34 and HIF-1α and VEGF and HIF-1α expression in invasive front vessels. CD34 expression was statistically correlated with the level of infiltration. A significant trend to worse disease-free survival was also determined with increased invasive front vessel expression of CD34, VEGF and HIF-1α. Conclusions Our data highlight the importance of the invasive margin in POM biology. The high angiogenic activity and endothelial VEGF and HIF-1α expression in invasive front vessels have a significant impact on patient survival and future agents targeted against VEGF pathway may represent a novel and effective therapeutic opportunity. Larger studies are needed to further address our findings.

In contrast, the United States blood supply is provided by many different organizations with different organizational structures and philosophies. Certain areas of the United States are chronically unable to collect enough blood to meet their local transfusion needs. This occurs mostly in metropolitan areas that serve large trauma, tertiary, and transplantation centers. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is a professional, nonprofit, scientific, and administrative association for individuals and institutions engaged in the many facets of blood transfusion and cellular therapies. America's Blood Centers (ABC) is an association of independent not-for-profit community blood centers established in 1962. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) is a trade association that advocates for the world's source plasma collectors and producers of plasma-based therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The occurrence of trauma in older people is well-documented; however the incidence of maxillofacial trauma is scarcely reported. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the causes and consequences of maxillofacial trauma in older people. Design: A five-year (March 95 - March 2000) retrospective study was earned out of all patients over the age of 65 years with facial trauma presenting to Accident and Emergency Department (A&E). The information was collected using the medical notes and discharge summaries. Setting: The Departments of A&E and Maxillofacial Surgery. Subjects: A total of 42 patients' records were examined for study related data. Results: A total of 42 patients were seen during the study period. Thirty-six gave a history of a fall, of which 15 had tripped, 5 had slipped, 3 resulted from a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), 1 as a result of alcohol abuse, in 1 a prosthetic knee gave way and 11 gave no cause for the fall. Of the remaining 6 patients. 5 were assaulted and 1 had a wardrobe fall on top of him. The majority of the falls occurred during the winter months. Maxillofacial injuries were noted in 27 of the 42 patients. Sixteen patients had cheekbone fractures, 8 mandibular fractures, 2 midface and 1 orbital complex fracture. Twenty-five percent of cheekbone fractures and 50% of mandibular fractures were treated surgically. Medical history was noted in 27 patients. Conclusions: This study clearly demonstrates the majority of the facial trauma in the older people can be treated conservatively unless the patients complain of functional problems.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone is an effective preservative and a major cause of cosmetic allergy in most European countries. On the face unusual clinical presentations are seborrhoeic dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, lymphocytic infiltrate, photodermatosis or atopic dermatitis. Three patients who suffered a chronic, recurrent, itchy and generalized cutaneous erytematous-desquamative and eczematous eruption with a common pathologic event, an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, whose induction by a contact allergen can be discussed are presented. The first, a 59 years old man showed a biopsy with an atypical dermal-epidermal T cell infiltrate of mycosis fungoides and monoclonal TCR-rearrangement. The second, a 74 years old man showed an atypical lymphoid infiltration with polyclonal TCR-rearrangement and a second biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. The third, a 50 year old man with pathology of plaque parapsoriasis with atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The three patients showed strong positive reaction to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone (0.01%aq.) Trolab,,?. Avoiding the allergen the cutaneous eruption disappeared and any recurrence has been observed yet. Pathologic criteria for mycosis fungoides remains controversial and could not be done only on the basis of cellular density or the percentage of atypical T-cells. Autoinvolutive mycosis fungoides shows the unknowledge of its pathogenesis. How some allergens could affect on the cellular life needs further studies. We highly recommend to patch test all patients with atypical cutaneous T-cell infiltrates.

AB  - Summary The spinal cord is a densely packed structure composed of gray matter containing motor neurons and a variety of ascending and descending tracts. A wide variety of conditions may affect the spinal cord at a particular level either by destruction or compression. Alternatively, toxic, metabolic, infectious, or degenerative processes may selectively affect particularly vulnerable cell populations or tracts. Clinicians must not only be knowledgeable about the anatomy of the spinal cord, but also be cognizant of the wide variety of pathologic processes that may affect its function in order to make an accurate diagnosis and plan appropriate therapy.

AB  - Abstract Children have differences in their physiology, anatomy and they are continuing to grow and develop. The management of pathology, trauma, deformity and upper airway obstruction in the young growing patient has to take into account these factors in the treatment planning for these conditions. It is important for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons to understand the potential impact of disease or injury on the developing facial skeleton and dentition. This chapter will provide an overview of the some of the major components of paediatric maxillofacial surgery and their management.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes after radical mandibulectomy in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Eight cats were included. Methods Medical records were searched for cats with confirmed oral neoplasia treated with radical mandibulectomy. Data collected included demographics, surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative management, and outcomes. Results Ages ranged from 8 to 17?years. All cats had 75% to 90% of the mandible removed and feeding tubes placed. Seven cats had squamous cell carcinoma, and one cat had a giant cell tumor. Six cats ate on their own postoperatively. Three cats had local recurrence and tumor-related died at 136 and 291?days. Six cats had no recurrence, with survival times of 156, 465, 608, and 1023?days, and two cats were still alive at 316 and 461 days after surgery. The three long-term survivors died of causes unrelated to oral neoplasia. One cat died at 156?days due to aspiration of food material. The overall estimated mean survival time was 712 days. Conclusion After radical mandibulectomy, independent food intake was achieved in 6 of eight cats, and four cats lived longer than one year. Clinical significance: Radical mandibulectomy should be considered for the treatment of extensive oral neoplasia in cats. Successful long-term outcomes are possible with aggressive supportive care perioperatively.
