AB  - Groups of 48 Wistar rats were subjected to thrice-weekly palatal application of the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) in propylene glycol 18, 12, 6 or 2 times, each 255 nmol 4NQO, in order to examine the relationship between the dose of the carcinogen and the tumour response. Other groups were treated with solvent alone or were left untreated. When the carcinogen was applied 18 or 12 times, squamous cell or verrucous carcinomas developed in 50% of the rats in 11 and 12 months, respectively, whereas rats subjected to the carcinogen 6 times demonstrated a 50% cancer rate in 23 months. Rats twice exposed to the carcinogen demonstrated a tumour rate of 25% in 30 months. Decreasing doses of 4NQO thus prolonged the latency period and decreased the tumour rate. The tumour development in the animals subjected to two carcinogen applications was significantly different from the tumour development among the solvent-treated animals, indicating that application of 255 nmol may approximate the initiating dose of 4NQO to be used in a two- or multi-stage carcinogenesis protocol. Most of the carcinomas, either squamous cell or verrucous, were located to the hard palate and to the gingival region of the upper jaw. Impaction of hair, bedding material and food was thought to promote the carcinogenic process.

AB  - Abstract Children have differences in their physiology, anatomy and they are continuing to grow and develop. The management of pathology, trauma, deformity and upper airway obstruction in the young growing patient has to take into account these factors in the treatment planning for these conditions. It is important for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons to understand the potential impact of disease or injury on the developing facial skeleton and dentition. This chapter will provide an overview of the some of the major components of paediatric maxillofacial surgery and their management.

AB  - Abstract This review addresses the current status of steroid therapies for hearing and vestibular disorders and how certain misconceptions may be undermining the efficacy in restoring normal ear function, both experimentally and clinically. Specific misconceptions addressed are that steroid therapy is not effective, steroid-responsive hearing loss proves an underlying inflammatory problem in the ear, and steroids only have application to the hearing disorders listed below. Glucocorticoid therapy for hearing and balance disorders has been employed for over 60 years. It is recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss, Meniére's disease, immune-mediated hearing loss, and any vestibular dysfunction suspected of having an inflammatory etiology. The predominant steroids employed today are dexamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Despite years of use, little is known of the steroid responsive mechanisms in the ear that are influenced by glucocorticoid therapy. Furthermore, meta-analyses and clinical study reviews occasionally question whether steroids offer any benefit at all. Foremost in the minds of clinicians is the immune suppression and anti-inflammatory functions of steroids because of their efficacy for autoimmune hearing loss. However, glucocorticoids have a strong binding affinity for the mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and glucocorticoid receptors, both of which are prominent in the ear. Because the auditory and vestibular end organs require tightly regulated endolymph and perilymph fluids, this ion homeostasis role of the mineralocorticoid receptor cannot be overlooked in both normal and pathologic functions of the ear. The function of the glucocorticoid receptor is to provide anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic signals by mediating survival factors. Anat Rec, 2012. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes after radical mandibulectomy in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Eight cats were included. Methods Medical records were searched for cats with confirmed oral neoplasia treated with radical mandibulectomy. Data collected included demographics, surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative management, and outcomes. Results Ages ranged from 8 to 17?years. All cats had 75% to 90% of the mandible removed and feeding tubes placed. Seven cats had squamous cell carcinoma, and one cat had a giant cell tumor. Six cats ate on their own postoperatively. Three cats had local recurrence and tumor-related died at 136 and 291?days. Six cats had no recurrence, with survival times of 156, 465, 608, and 1023?days, and two cats were still alive at 316 and 461 days after surgery. The three long-term survivors died of causes unrelated to oral neoplasia. One cat died at 156?days due to aspiration of food material. The overall estimated mean survival time was 712 days. Conclusion After radical mandibulectomy, independent food intake was achieved in 6 of eight cats, and four cats lived longer than one year. Clinical significance: Radical mandibulectomy should be considered for the treatment of extensive oral neoplasia in cats. Successful long-term outcomes are possible with aggressive supportive care perioperatively.

AB  - Abstract Detection and accurate classification of traumatic tarsal fractures are important for identifying cases requiring surgical intervention. The aim of this prospective, experimental, methods comparison study was to directly compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tarsal computed tomography (CT), ten-view and two-view digital radiographs for detecting traumatic fractures of the canine tarsus. The working hypothesis was that tarsal fractures would be detected with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using CT imaging compared to radiography, and a ten-view would be superior to a two-view radiographic study. Ten cadaver hind limbs of medium to large dogs received a CT scan and ten-view radiographic study before and after induction of fractures with a hydraulic press. All bones included in the radiographic images were assessed for fractures by two observers and gross dissection was used as the gold standard. The two-view radiographic study (dorsoplantar, lateromedial) was created from the ten-view study and reviewed 2 years later. All limbs sustained fractures, the most common locations were the talus and calcaneus (n = 7). The sensitivity of CT was greater than ten-view radiographic study (77% vs. 57%), while the specificity was similar (97% vs. 98%). The sensitivity and specificity of the ten-view and two-view radiograph studies were similar (57% vs. 55%; both 98%). Computed tomography images were reassessed postdissection to determine if failure to identify fractures resulted from observer error. Overall, CT was better than radiography for detecting fractures of the canine tarsus, however there was little improvement with ten-view compared to two-view radiographic studies.

Role of decreased brain glucose metabolism in neurofibrillary degeneration ?? Subgroups of AD ?? Therapeutic approaches to inhibit neurofibrillary degeneration Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is multi-factorial and heterogeneous. Independent of the aetiology, this disease is characterized clinically by chronic and progressive dementia and histopathologically by neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau seen as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites, and by neuritic (senile) plaques of ?-amyloid. The neurofibrillary degeneration is apparently required for the clinical expression of AD, and in related tauopathies it leads to dementia in the absence of amyloid plaques. While normal tau promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau sequesters normal tau, MAP1 and MAP2, and disrupts microtubules. The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau also promotes its self-assembly into tangles of paired helical and or straight filaments. Tau is phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and cyclin dependent protein kinase 5 (cdk5) are among the kinases most implicated in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. Among the phosphatases which regulate the phosphorylation of tau, protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A), the activity of which is down-regulated in AD brain, is by far the major enzyme. The inhibition of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the development of disease modifying drugs. A great advantage of inhibiting neurofibrillary degeneration is that it can be monitored by evaluating the levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at various known abnormally hyperphosphorylated sites in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients, obtained by lumbar puncture. There are at least five subgroups of AD, each is probably caused by a different etiopathogenic mechanism. The AD subgroup identification of patients can help increase the success of clinical trials and the development of specific and potent disease modifying drugs.

AB  - Summary Necropsies were performed on 496 horses that had a fatal injury or illness at a California racetrack during the period February 20th 1990 to March 1st 1992. The primary cause of death was categorised by breed, activity at time of injury or illness and organ system affected. Most of the submissions were Thoroughbred horses (432) and Quarter Horses (46). Most of the injuries occurred while racing (42%) and in training sessions (39%); with fewer non-exercise (12%) and accident (7%) related injuries or illnesses. Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 83% of the Thoroughbred and 80% of the Quarter Horse submissions. The Thoroughbred horses incurred 306 fractures with 263 in the limbs and 90% of those in the forelimbs. The proximal sesamoid bone(s), third metacarpal bone and humerus were the most common bones fractured in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter Horses. Other major causes of death included respiratory, digestive and multi-organ system disorders.

AB  - Objective To describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthroscopic, and histopathologic changes in dogs with medial coronoid disease and to identify potential relationships between these findings. Study Design Retrospective case series. Sample Population Twenty-five diseased medial coronoid processes (MCP) were collected from 19 dogs with a confirmed diagnosis of medial coronoid disease that were surgically treated by subtotal coronoid ostectomy. A reference group of normal MCP was collected from 9 dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to elbow disease. Methods MCP specimens were evaluated by MRI using a novel grading scheme (all dogs), arthroscopy using a modified Outerbridge scheme (affected dogs only) and histopathology (all dogs). Results The common histopathologic findings were subchondral microfractures, subchondral microfractures continuous with cartilaginous fissures, moderate to severe hypercellularity of the marrow space, trabecular bone necrosis, and articular cartilage degeneration. The severity of cartilage disease in the MCP was moderate to severe in most specimens, even in cases with minimal arthroscopic pathology. Three distinct patterns of bone marrow lesion (BML) were identified adjacent to the MCP, but there was no correlation between BML pattern and either histopathologic or arthroscopic findings. There was moderate correlation between modified Outerbridge scores and MRI scores. No correlation was identified between the histopathologic changes and either MRI or arthroscopic scores. Conclusion There was no significant correlation between the clinical scores and histopathologic changes. Ongoing improvements in the resolution of noninvasive imaging techniques will likely improve description and understanding of the MCP disease in dogs.

AB  - Abstract This paper uses macroscopic and radiological examinations to provide differential diagnoses of pathological lesions in the skeleton of a young woman, 20?25 years of age, which triggered the Danish palaeopathologist Vilhelm M?ller-Christensen's interest in leprosy. The skeleton was incomplete, but the majority of bones of the upper body, as well as the skull, were present. The pathological changes consisted of medullary and cortical lytic foci, periosteal reaction and enhanced cortical density. The lesions were most extensive on the left side, especially around the elbow, wrist and scapula. Treponematosis, leprosy, smallpox, ergotism, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis are all reviewed with regard to bone and joint pathology and their likelihood of being the correct diagnosis. We concluded that the most plausible diagnosis is treponematosis, but neither sarcoidosis nor smallpox can be completely excluded. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Methods A total of 5,416 Danish female eldercare workers from 309 work units were surveyed using questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms and psychosocial working conditions. LTSA was derived from a national register. We aggregated scores of psychosocial working conditions to the work unit-level and conducted multi-level Poisson regression analyses. Results Depressive symptoms, but not psychosocial working conditions, predicted LTSA. Psychosocial working conditions did not statistically significantly modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. Conclusions Psychosocial working conditions did not modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. The results, however, need to be interpreted with caution, as we cannot rule out lack of exposure contrast and non-differential misclassification of the exposure. Am. J. Ind.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of chronic wounds is increased among older adults, and the impact of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. It is well established that wound healing slows with age. However, the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The impact of age and accompanying multi-morbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables, lack of standardization in data collection, and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this paper, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify key research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background. Peritoneal adhesion is a common complication following abdominal surgery. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, it still presents a problem for the patients and surgeons. In the present study, we investigated the effects of octenidindihydro-chloride ? phenoxyethanol (OCP) on peritoneal adhesions. Method. Rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 (saline), Group 2 (peritonitis plus saline), Group 3 (OCP), and Group 4 (peritonitis plus OCP). Peritonitis was induced in the rats of Groups 2 and 4. The abdominal cavities of the rats in Groups 1 and 2 were washed with saline, while those of the rats in Groups 3 and 4 were irrigated with 1:10 OCP solution. Adhesion and fibrotic scores were determined by re-laparotomy after 21 days. Results. The adhesion scores in Groups 1 (saline), 2 (peritonitis plus saline), 3 (OCP) and 4 (peritonitis plus OCP) were 3.30±0.94, 5.25±1.03, 1.12±0.83 and 0.28±0.48, respectively. Statistical analysis of adhesion scores revealed significant differences between groups, except between Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.265). Statistical analyses of grades of histopathological signs showed that Group 1 differed from Groups 2 and 4 (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, respectively); Group 2 differed from Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, differences between Group 3 and Groups 1 and 4 were not significant (p = 0.06, p = 0.08, respectively). Conclusion. OCP decreased the peritoneal adhesion formation macroscopically and microscopically in the presence or absence of peritonitis. Peritoneal defects due to trauma are to be left open and OCP diluted 1:1 should not be used intraperitoneally.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent an ideal source of autologous cell-based therapy for chronic wounds. Functional characteristics of MSCs may benefit wound healing by exerting their multi-regenerative potential. However, cell ageing resulting from chronic degenerative diseases or donor age could cause inevitable effects on the regenerative abilities of MSCs. A variety of studies have shown the relationship between MSC ageing and age-related dysfunction, but few associate these age-related impacts on MSCs with their ability of repairing chronic wounds, which are common in the elderly population. Here, we discuss the age-associated changes of MSCs and describe the potential impacts on MSC-based therapy for chronic wounds. Furthermore, critical evaluation of the current literatures is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms of MSC ageing and raising the corresponding concerns on considering their possible use for chronic wound repair.

AB  - Abstract:? Sudden unexplained deaths, especially those unwitnessed can lead to forensic issues and would necessitate the need for a meticulous and complete postmortem examination including ancillary investigations to discover the cause of death. We herein report a case of sudden unexplained death caused by malaria in an apparently healthy individual. This fatal case is presented to remind the forensic pathologist of the possibility of malaria as a cause of sudden unexplained death in malaria-endemic regions. In the present case, histopathological examination demonstrated the presence of parasitized red blood cells with malarial pigment in the blood capillaries in the brain, myocardium, pericardium, lungs, kidneys, liver, and the spleen. Cerebral malaria with acute renal insufficiency or pulmonary edema with an acute respiratory distress syndrome might have been the cause of death.

AB  - Background and Objective Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel endoscopic technique that can image cells and subcellular layers of the gastric mucosa in vivo. We aimed to investigate the value of CLE in assessing the quality of ulcer healing (QOUH) and preliminarily establish evaluation criteria. Materials and Methods Patients with duodenal ulcers were enrolled. After duodenal ulcer healing, we compared the value of CLE and white light endoscopy (WLE) in assessing the QOUH by using the histopathological diagnosis as the gold standard. At the same time, immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expressions of transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in normal and scar tissues. Results In assessing the QOUH classified as poor, good, and excellent by the pathological classification, the sensitivity of WLE was 57.14%, 50%, and 47.06%, the specificity was 87.80%, 52.38%, and 81.58%, and the accuracy was 80.00%, 50.91%, and 70.91%, respectively. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of CLE was 73.33%, 85.19%, and 92.31%, the specificity was 95%, 85.71%, and 92.86%, and the accuracy was 89.09%, 85.45%, and 92.73%, respectively. The ? value for the correlation with pathological diagnosis grade was 0.38 for WLE vs. 0.74 for CLE. The assessment of the QOUH in the CLE image classification showed great improvement compared with that in the WLE image classification. The image classification of CLE was not associated with the immunohistochemical expression of TGF-?1 or FGF-2 according the Spearman rank correlation (P?>?0.05). Conclusion Compared with WLE, CLE has a higher value in assessing the QOUH. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
