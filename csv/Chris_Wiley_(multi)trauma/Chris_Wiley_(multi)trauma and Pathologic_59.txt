AB  - Objectives To investigate the outcome of dogs with central nervous system lymphoma. Materials and Methods A multi-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted by reviewing medical records of 18 cases of central nervous system lymphoma from seven institutions. Results Diagnosis of lymphoma was made through cerebrospinal fluid analysis, histopathology, flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid, and cytology of cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node or spleen with correlated imaging. A total of 15 of 18 dogs received specific treatment other than prednisone. Three dogs underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgical decompression, five dogs underwent chemotherapy, two dogs underwent radiation therapy after surgical decompression, three dogs underwent chemotherapy after surgical decompression and two dogs underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Only one dog received prednisone, and two dogs did not receive any treatment. Overall, the median survival time was 171?days (range 1 to 1942?days). Clinical Significance Dogs receiving any type of treatment for central nervous system lymphoma lived longer than cases described in previous historical reports. Further studies are needed to elucidate the importance of specific treatment modalities.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Objective To examine perioperative mortality, long-term survival, causes of death, and prognostic factors for dogs and cats undergoing surgical excision of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Eighty dogs and 32 cats. Methods Follow-up information was obtained for dogs and cats that underwent surgical excision of a TET between 2001 and 2012. Results Perioperative mortality was 20% in dogs and 22% in cats. No independent risk factors for perioperative mortality were identified. The estimated median survival time for all dogs was 1.69 years (95% CI 0.56?4.32) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 55% (95% CI 44?67) and 44% (95% CI 32?56). The estimated median survival time for all cats was 3.71 years (95% CI 0.56-unestimatable) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 70% (95% CI 53?87) and 47% (95% CI 0?100). Of animals that survived to discharge, 42% of dogs and 20% of cats eventually died of TET-related causes. The presence of paraneoplastic syndromes (hazard ratio [HR] 5.78, 95% CI 1.64?20.45, P?=?.007) or incomplete histologic margins (HR 6.09, 95% CI 1.50?24.72, P?=?.01) were independently associated with decreased survival in dogs. No significant predictors of survival were identified in cats. Conclusions regarding the effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy could not be made. Conclusions While there is substantial risk of perioperative death in dogs and cats undergoing surgery for TETs, many animals that survive to discharge have prolonged survival. Survival is significantly decreased in dogs with paraneoplastic syndromes or incomplete histologic margins.

AB  - Objectives To estimate the incidence proportion of road traffic accidents in cats attending emergency out-of-hours clinics in the UK, identify major risk factors for road traffic accident occurrence and for survival to discharge. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of a cohort of 33,053 cats in the VetCompass database attending emergency-care practice between January 1, 2012 and February 15, 2014. Incidence proportion was calculated and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for road traffic accident and survival to discharge following road traffic accident. Results Incidence proportion was estimated at 4∙2% (95% confidence interval: 4∙0 to 4∙4%). Cats aged 6 months to 2 years were at increased odds of road traffic accident, as were male cats and crossbred cats. Odds of road traffic accident were highest in the autumn. Spinal injury, abdominal injury and increasing count of injuries were associated with increased odds of death. Clinical Significance Road traffic accident is a frequent presentation in emergency-care practice. Identification of risk factors for death within the first 24?hours following a road traffic accident can aid veterinarian and owner decision-making for treatment of cats involved in a road traffic accident.

AB  - Summary Evidence for Iron Age funerary treatments remains sporadic across Britain and formal cemeteries are especially elusive. One important exception is Broxmouth hillfort, East Lothian, excavated during the late 1970s but not yet published. New analysis of the human remains from Broxmouth provides evidence for three distinct populations: a formal cemetery outside the hillfort, isolated graves within the ramparts, and a scatter of disarticulated fragments from a range of domestic and midden contexts. The latter group in particular provides significant evidence for violent trauma; isotopic evidence suggests that they may be the remains of outsiders. Together the human remains shed light on complex and changing attitudes to death and the human body in Iron Age Britain. The material from Broxmouth is considered in the light of emerging evidence for fluid and pluralistic treatments of the dead in the Iron Age of south-east Scotland.

AB  - Objective To compare postoperative CT images with plain radiographs for measuring prognostic factors of reduction loss of fractures of the proximal part of the humerus. Methods A total of 65 patients who sustained fractures of the proximal humerus treated with locking plates from June 2012 to October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 men and 41 women, with a mean age of 60.0 years (range, 22?76 years). According to the Neer classification system of proximal humeral fracture, there were 26 two-part, 27 three-part and 12 four-part fractures of the proximal part of the humerus, and all fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using locked plating. All postoperative CT images and plain radiographs of the patients were obtained. Prognostic factors of the reduction loss were the change of neck shaft angle (NSA) and the change of humeral head height (HHH). The change of NSA and HHH were evaluated by the difference between postoperative initial and final follow-up measurement. Reduction loss was defined as the change ≥10° for NSA or ≥5 mm for HHH. The NSA and HHH were measured using plain radiographs and 3-D CT images, both initially and at final follow-up. The paired t-test was used for comparison of NSA, change of NSA, HHH, and change of HHH between two image modalities. The differences between two image modalities in the assessment of reduction loss were examined using the ?2-test (McNemar test). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer reliability. Results 3-D CT images (ICC range, 0.834?0.967) were more reliable in all parameters when compared with plain radiographs (ICC range, 0.598?0.915). Significant differences were found between the two image modalities in all parameters (plain radiographs: initial NSA = 133.6° ± 3.8°, final NSA = 130.0° ± 1.9°, initial HHH = 17.9 ± 0.9 mm, final HHH = 15.8 ± 1.5 mm; 3-D CT: initial NSA = 131.4° ± 3.4°, final NSA = 128.8° ± 1.7°, initial HHH = 16.8 ± 1.2 mm, final HHH = 14.5 ± 1.1 mm; all P < 0.05). In the assessment of reduction loss, the percentage was 16.9% (11/65) for the plain radiographs and 7.7% (5/65) for the 3-D CT scans (P < 0.05). For the 5 patients with reduction loss, which were observed by two imaging modalities, the mean Constant?Murley score was 61.0 ± 1.6. The patients with reduction loss, observed only in plain radiographs but not CT images, had good shoulder function (Constant?Murley score: 82.7 ± 1.0). Conclusions Our data reveal that 3-D CT images are more reliable than plain radiographs in the assessment of the prognostic factors of reduction loss of fractures of the proximal part of the humerus with treatment of locking plates; this reliable CT technique can serve as an effective guideline for the subsequent clinical management of patients.

AB  - Nodular fasciitis is a benign self-limited myofibroblastic neoplasm, which usually involves the upper extremities and trunk of young patients. These tumors have been shown to harbor a translocation involving the MYH9 and USP6 genes, leading to overexpression of the latter. We report seven cases of nodular fasciitis with cutaneous presentations. All cases involved the dermis, with six involving the superficial subcutis, and one auricular tumor extending into cartilage. All cases showed USP6 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization; in two of three cases, the characteristic MYH9-USP6 fusion was shown by RT-PCR. All patients underwent conservative resection. Nodular fasciitis is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that can occasionally present in superficial locations and is sometimes mistaken for a malignant process. Molecular testing can be useful to distinguish this entity from other cutaneous spindle cell tumors.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - A study of veterinarians' perceptions, and experience, of non-accidental injury (NAI) to pets was undertaken using an anonymous questionnaire distributed to a random sample of 1000 small animal practitioners in the UK. NAI was acknowledged by 91-3 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 88-2 to 93-9 per cent) of the 404 respondents who returned questionnaires, of whom 48-3 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 43-4 to 53-1 per cent) had either suspected or seen NAI. Four hundred and forty-eight cases were documented, predominantly in dogs (243) and cats (182). Factors either raising suspicion, or facilitating recognition, of NAI included: implication of a particular person, features of the history, referral agency involvement, behaviour of the owner and/or the animal, nature of the injuries, and socioeconomic class of owners. Additionally, sexual abuse and suspected cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy were recorded.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract.? ?Objectives: Because the trigone is a unique region in the caudal bladder with a higher risk of neoplasia, we hypothesized that this area would have a high proportion of progenitor cells. As yet there is no marker nor methodology to specifically isolate urothelial stem cells, and thus demonstrate multi-potential differentiation and self-renewal. Here, our goal was to evaluate the distribution of progenitor cells that carry two general major attributes of stem cells: clonogenicity and proliferative capacity. Materials and methods: The bladders of Fisher rats were divided into caudal and cephalic segments and primary cultures were established from the harvested urothelial cells. Results: We found that colony-forming efficiency was almost 2-fold higher for cells from the caudal bladder compared to the cephalic bladder. Doubling time was significantly faster for cells harvested from the caudal bladder at initial plating. This suggested that the caudal bladder harbours a higher density of urothelial progenitor cells. With passage to p4, the differences between the upper and lower bladder were lost, suggesting selection of proliferative cells with serial passage. Based on Ki-67 staining, there was no geographical difference in cell proliferation under normal homeostatic in vivo conditions. Conclusions: These results demonstrate geographical sequestration of urothelial progenitor cells to the area of the bladder that encompasses the bladder neck and trigone, which may be a factor in pathological disparities between the trigone and remaining bladder.

AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated the specificity of autobiographical memories among depressed and non-depressed borderline patients, compared with depressed patients and controls. The influence of childhood trauma, intrusions of traumatic events, avoidance of intrusions, dissociation and depression on memory specificity was also studied. Method: The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a trauma interview and self-report measures of intrusions, avoidance, depression and dissociation were administered to 83 borderline outpatients, 26 depressed outpatients and 30 controls. Results: Depressed borderline patients and depressed patients reported fewer specific memories than controls. Depressed patients generated fewer specific memories than non-depressed borderline patients. Neither trauma nor traumatic intrusions, avoidance of intrusions or dissociation were related to the specificity of memories. Level of depressive symptoms (BDI) was also not related, but the presence of a depression was. Conclusion: In this large sample of outpatients with borderline personality disorder, only the subgroup with a co-morbid diagnosis of depression had trouble remembering specific events from the past. Trauma, intrusions, avoidance of intrusions and dissociation seem to be unrelated to the specificity of autobiographical memories in borderline personality disorder.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcoma constitutes a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumours. Although they are common in the dog, many uncertainties surround the best options for clinical management. Despite recent improvements in outcome, approximately one in five patients may still die as a result of their disease. There is some evidence that wide surgical excision may not be required for every soft tissue sarcoma but, conversely, complacency in treatment may adversely affect outcomes for patients with aggressive disease. The purpose of this review is to examine the issues affecting the management of canine soft tissue sarcoma, and to evaluate the human literature for lessons that may guide future treatment directions for dogs. Comparative lessons from human soft tissue sarcoma that may be important for the canine patient in the future include (1) understanding the oncogenic potential of the pseudocapsule to better predict tumour behaviour and optimal surgical margins, (2) recognising the importance of planned multi-modality therapy for improving tumour control, (3) considering a role for compartmental resection strategies and (4) improving the accuracy of pretreatment analysis of the tumour to better predict behaviour and optimal treatment options.

AB  - Objectives: Co-oximetry is a complex and valuable laboratory method that measures haemoglobin species and oxygenation status by multi-wavelength spectrophotometry. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for clinically healthy dogs and to determine the effect of time of analyses and sex of animals on the accuracy of results. Methods: Blood was collected from 27 healthy adult dogs of various breeds and sex. Co-oximetry was performed on a CCX co-oximeter that measures eight haemoglobin and oxygen transport related parameters: carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb), oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb), methaemoglobin (MetHb), total haemoglobin (tHb), oxygen saturation (SO2%), oxygen content (O2Ct) and oxygen capacity (O2Cap). Results: Results obtained after 2 and 4 hours were not significantly different from those obtained immediately after sampling. But after 48 hours, the results for total haemoglobin, oxygen saturation, oxyhaemoglobin, oxygen content and oxygen capacity were significantly lower, and carboxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin values were significantly higher than determination immediately after sampling. Gender had no significant impact on co-oximetry values. Clinical Significance: Co-oximetry offers several advantages compared with other methods, including ease of use, increased accuracy and greater differentiation among haemoglobin species.

AB  - Abstract Background.? Painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), whether pathologic or osteoporotic, are a source of morbidity in cancer patients. At our tertiary cancer center, over the past decade we have used vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) to treat painful VCFs. More data are needed on the treatment of VCFs in cancer patients with these techniques. Methods.? We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of cancer patients with painful VCFs that had been treated at our institution between January 1, 2001 and May 31, 2008. Information was collected on demographic and clinical characteristics, features of the fractures, procedural details, and complications. Pre- and post-procedural pain and related symptoms were assessed using a subset of patients who had responded to the Brief Pain Inventory and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Results.? A total of 407 cancer patients had 1,156 fractures that had been treated with VP or KP during 536 surgical procedures. Patients had an average of 2.8 fractures (range, 1?10). The majority of patients had pathologic fractures due to multiple myeloma (43%) or osteoporotic fractures (35%). Most fractures occurred in the thoracolumbar region. Adjacent-level fractures occurred in 18% of patients. Surgery provided significant relief from pain and several related symptoms. Symptomatic, serious complications requiring open surgery occurred in two cases (<0.01%) in our series. Conclusions.? Our single-center experience revealed that a large number of cancer patients suffer from painful VCFs. The use of VP or KP in treating painful VCFs in cancer patients has good efficacy and an acceptably low complication rate.

AB  - Summary Established post-traumatic spinal cord injuries can serve as an ?experimental model? in which trauma has partially separated the ?spinal neuronal pool? from supraspinal influence. Our findings show that: (1) when the muscle is deprived of upper motor neuron activity, fatigue resistance is diminished and external, electrically induced daily contractions will restore the level of fatigue resistance close to that of muscles in healthy, active subjects; (2) the spinal interneuron network, when completely deprived of brain influence, is a ?spinal reflex centre? with a relatively restricted and low excitability level; and (3) the ?discomplete spinal cord injury? model illustrates that spasticity is of suprasegmental origin and that there are two basic features of brain motor control of the spinal interneuron system: the command to restrict interneuronal pool activity and the command to activate the interneuronal network. Moreover, I have described the modifiability of fatigue resistance. locomotor patterns and different alternatives in the neurocontrol of motor activity, depending on the kind and degree of residual brain influence. Such significant modifiability can be thought of as plasticity of the neuromuscular system and impaired control of the nervous system.
