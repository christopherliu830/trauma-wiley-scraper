AB  - Abstract The Museum Vrolik collection of anatomical specimens in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, comprises over 5,000 specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, we rediagnosed a subset of the collection comprising dried infantile, juvenile, and adult human skulls with congenital and acquired conditions. On external examination and additional radiography, we found 58 skulls with craniosynostosis (CS) involving one or more sutures and 40 skulls with a presumed suture related condition. Most of these were part of the material collected and described by Louis Bolk (1866?1930). Analysis of his observations suggests that skull deformation because of premature suture closure depends not only on the identity of the sutures involved but also on the timing and progression of their closure and the extent of their involvement. Moreover, premature closure of the sagittal suture after 3?6 years of age appeared to be much more common than expected because it is not accompanied by skull deformation. Many of the skulls with single-suture CS were microcephalic, which may be the cause of the premature synostosis. By contrast, microcephaly may be a resulting phenomenon in multi-suture CS. We noticed that the quotient between height of the cranial vault (vertex-porion distance) and head circumference, multiplied by 100, was 26 or higher only in those CS cases with multi-suture involvement. We therefore consider this parameter, which we named ?acrocephalic index,? to be an indicator of multi-suture involvement in individual CS cases. In two adult skulls, the skull had a quadrangular shape, which we assumed to be correlated to the presence of an unusually interdigitated open metopic suture. We propose to name this anomaly: tetragonocephaly. Another presumed suture-related condition, bathrocephaly, was found concomitantly with basilar invagination in several cases. We hypothesize that the chronically raised intracranial pressure in these cases caused the still open lambdoidal sutures to distend and the occipital bone to protrude. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A variety of benign and malignant cutaneous vascular lesions occur in irradiated skin. We report two cases of vascular lesions that developed on the breast within a year after radiation therapy for breast carcinoma. Both cases mimicked Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) histologically. We compare these with one case of post-irradiation angiosarcoma and 3 cases of acquired progressive lymphangioma (APL) unrelated to radiation therapy. The post-irradiation vascular lesions showed slit-like vessels dissecting through superficial dermal collagen, leading to an initial diagnosis of KS by one contributing pathologist. Immunohistochemically, the vessels in both cases expressed CD31 and CD34, stained only partially for actin, and had a low Ki67 proliferation index. Neither case expressed HHV8. The post-irradiation angiosarcoma occurred three years after radiation, and also exhibited a focal slit-like growth pattern resembling KS. However, there was marked cytologic atypia, a high proliferation rate, and negative staining for HHV8. The APL were characterized by more ectactic vascular spaces and deeper involvement of the dermis than was present in the post-irradiation lesions. These cases also failed to stain for HHV8. Recognition of the phenomenon of post-irradiation vascular proliferations is important, especially because such lesions may resemble KS, yet invariably follow a benign clinical course.

AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - Abstract The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a well-known source of low back and pelvic pain, of increasing interest for both conservative and surgical treatment. Alterations in the kinematics of the pelvis have been hypothesized as a major cause of SIJ-related pain. However, definitions of both the range and the extent of physiological movement are controversial, and there are no clear baseline data for pathological alterations. The present study combined a novel biomechanical setup allowing for physiological motion of the lumbosacral transition and pelvis without restricting the SIJ movement in vitro, combined with optical image correlation. Six fresh human pelvises (81 ± 10 years, three females, three males) were tested, with bodyweight-adapted loading applied to the fifth lumbar vertebra and both acetabula. Deformation at the lumbopelvises was determined computationally from three-dimensional image correlation data. Sacroiliac joint motion under the loading of 100% bodyweight primarily consisted of a z-axis rotation (0.16°) and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium (0.32 mm). Sacroiliac joint flexion-extension rotations were minute (< 0.02°). Corresponding movements of the SIJ were found at the lumbosacral transition, with an anterior translation of L5 relative to the sacrum of ?0.97 mm and an inferior translation of 0.11 mm, respectively. Moreover, a flexion of 1.82° was observed at the lumbosacral transition. Within the innominate bone and at the pubic symphysis, small complementary rotations were seen around a vertical axis, accounting for ?0.10° and 0.11°, respectively. Other motions were minute and accompanied by large interindividual variation. The present study provides evidence of different SIJ motions than reported previously when exerted by physiological loading. Sacroiliac joint kinematics were in the sub-degree and sub-millimeter range, in line with previous in vivo and in vitro findings, largely limited to the sagittal rotation and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium. This given physiological loading scenario underlines the relevance of the lumbosacral transition when considering the overall motion of the lumbopelvis, and how relatively little the other segments contribute to overall motion.

AB  - Summary Odontogenic cysts occur in tooth-bearing regions of the jaw and are lined by odontogenic epithelium, including residual dental lamina, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the epithelial root sheath. This chapter discusses the specific types of odontogenic cysts. It also discusses specific radiologic features as they pertain to a particular type of odontogenic cyst. Histopathologic examination plays a critical role in the diagnosis of odontogenic cysts. When sampled with the cyst lining as part of a biopsy sample, bone within the cyst wall is usually mildly proliferative, organized woven bone. The pathogenesis is initiated by endodontic disease, which is followed by inflammation at the root apex, bone loss, proliferation of residual epithelium, and fluid transport into the lumen of an epithelium-lined cavity. The risk of tumor development within odontogenic cysts is regularly referenced in both the human and veterinary literature on odontogenic cysts.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To collate and describe emergency admissions to a large animal tertiary university referral hospital during a 12-month period. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Large animal tertiary university referral hospital. Animals: Large animal emergency patient admissions. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical record included the presenting complaint, clinical problem, admission time, duration of clinical signs before presentation, diagnostic procedures performed, therapies administered, and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission, and survival to discharge. The most common category listed for the presenting complaint and clinical problem categories was gastrointestinal. Most emergency cases were admitted during the evening and in late spring, summer, and early fall. Most cases had a duration of clinical signs before presentation of >2 hours and ≤8 hours (27%) or >8 hours and ≤24 hours (29%). The most common diagnostic procedures performed during the first 24 hours were palpation per rectum, ultrasonographic examination, radiographs, and abdominocentesis. Antimicrobials, fluids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapies administered. Approximately 25% of cases required surgery. An exploratory celiotomy was performed in approximately 15% of cases. Enterotomy, intestinal resection and anastomosis, cesarean section, or joint or sheath lavage was each performed in <5% of cases. Overall survival to discharge was 74%. Conclusions: Large animal emergency clinicians are required to have knowledge on a wide range of diseases and should be proficient at performing numerous procedures on an emergency basis. Gastrointestinal disease is the most common type of emergency and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission are a reflection of this type of case. Only 25% of cases required surgery. Additional research in the form of a multicenter study and surveying both private and university practitioners needs to be performed to further define the necessary skills for an ?ideal? large animal emergency clinician.

AB  - Circumstantial evidence based on anecdote, case reports, epidemiological data and studies in vitro and in situ implicate tooth brushing with toothpaste with tooth wear, gingival recession and dentine hypersensitivity. This review attempts to assess the clinical significance of the potential harm produced by this most common oral hygiene habit. The toothbrush alone appears to have no effect on enamel and very little on dentine. Most toothpaste also has very little effect on enamel and in normal use would not cause significant wear of dentine in a lifetime of use. Wear of enamel and dentine can be dramatically increased if tooth brushing follows an erosive challenge. Gingival recession has a multi-factorial aetiology and certain individuals and specific teeth may be predisposed to trauma from tooth brushing. Tooth brushing is known to cause gingival abrasions but how these relate to gingival recession is not known. The role of toothpaste in gingival abrasion and recession surprisingly has received little if any attention. Gingival recession most commonly exposes dentine and localises sites for dentine hypersensitivity. Some toothpaste products can expose dentinal tubules but erosion is probably the more dominant factor in dentine hypersensitivity. There is no evidence to indicate that electric and manual toothbrushes differ in effects on soft and hard tissues. It is only under, over or abusive use or when combined with erosion that significant harm may be thus caused. In normal use it must be concluded that the benefits of tooth brushing far out-way the potential harm.

AB  - Abstract Background Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) is a common complication after abdominal surgery, but data about risk factors of PPOI for patients with gastric cancer are rare. We sought to investigate the impact of laparoscopic versus open surgery for PPOI after gastric cancer surgery. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a registry database consecutively collected from June 2016 to March 2017. PPOI was defined as no bowel function persisting for more than 4 days. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression models were performed to investigate risk factors, and stratified analysis was carried out to examine the primary association at different levels of a potential confounding factor. Results A total of 162 patients composed of 63 patients undergoing laparotomy and 99 patients undergoing laparoscopy were enrolled and PPOI was observed in 32 (19.75%) patients. Risk factors significantly correlated with PPOI were as follows: open surgery, older age, late surgical pathologic staging, postoperative use of opioid analgesic, low level of postoperative albumin and serum potassium. Compared to open surgery, the laparoscopic surgery was a strong protective factor for PPOI after adjusting related variables (OR = 0.17, CI: 0.05-0.52, P = .002). There was an interaction between surgical methods and the postoperative WBC level (P for interaction = .007). In the two group stratified analysis of WBC, laparoscopic surgery had a significant lower risk of PPOI than open group for the patients with WBC counts above the middle level in crude or adjusted models. This result remained significantly in the three group stratified analysis for the patients with WBC counts in the middle and or high tertile groups. Conclusions PPOI is a common postoperative complication of patients after gastrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with decreased risk of PPOI in gastric surgery. Patients who underwent open surgery and presented with high level of WBC should be cautious with PPOI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) development is often observed following traumatic knee injuries involving key stabilising structures such as the cruciate ligaments or the menisci. Both biomechanical and biological alterations that follow knee injuries have been implicated in PTOA development, although it has not been possible to differentiate clearly between the two causal factors. This review critically examines the outcomes from pre-clinical lapine and ovine injury models arising in the authors? laboratories and differing in severity of PTOA development and progression. Specifically, we focus on how varying severity of knee injuries influence the subsequent alterations in kinematics, kinetics, and biological outcomes. The immediate impact of injury on the lubrication capacity of the joint is examined in the context of its influence on biomechanical alterations, thus linking the biological changes to abnormal kinematics, leading to a focus on the potential areas for interventions to inhibit or prevent development of the disease. We believe that PTOA results from altered cartilage surface interactions where biological and biomechanical factors intersect, and mitigating acute joint inflammation may be critical to prolonging PTOA development. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To assess whether the bisection of the fabellae by their respective femoral cortices is a useful criterion for assessing positioning of craniocaudal pelvic limb radiographs, and whether this is consistent in limbs affected or unaffected by medial patella luxation. METHODS Computed tomography multi-planar reconstructions were used to determine the relative positions of the fabellae with respect to the femoral cortices. RESULTS Only 36% of fabellae overall were bisected by the femoral cortex. There was no significant difference between limbs affected or unaffected by medial patella luxation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The accurate measurement of femoral varus angle is important in pre-surgical planning of distal femoral ostectomy. Radiography is normally used to obtain the femoral varus angle, and femoral rotational malpositioning will induce errors in the femoral varus angle measured. Bisection of the fabellae by the femoral cortices is commonly cited as a criterion by which to assess whether a radiographic projection is truly craniocaudal, yet this study has shown this not to be valid.

AB  - New-onset diabetes after liver transplantation (NODALT) is a frequent complication with an unfavorable outcome. We previously demonstrated a crucial link between donor graft genetics and the risk of NODALT. We selected 15 matched pairs of NODALT and non-NODALT liver recipients using propensity score matching analysis. The donor liver tissues were tested for the expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating human hepatic glucose homeostasis. The biological functions of potential target genes were predicted using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Both miR-103 and miR-181a were significantly highly expressed in the NODALT group as compared to the non-NODALT group. The predicted target genes (e.g. Irs2, Pik3r1, Akt2, and Gsk3b) were involved in glucose import and the insulin signaling pathway. We also observed dysregulation of miRNAs (e.g. let-7, miR-26b, miR-145, and miR-183) in cultured human hepatocytes treated with tacrolimus or high glucose, the two independent risk factors of NODALT identified in this cohort. The hepatic miRNA profiles altered by tacrolimus or hyperglycemia were associated with insulin resistance and glucose homeostatic imbalance as revealed by enrichment analysis. The disease susceptibility miRNA expressive pattern could be imported directly from the donor and consolidated by the transplant factors.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness and safety of deracoxib (Deramaxx?) administered at a dose of 1?2 mg/kg/day for 3 days for control of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs. Study Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study. Animals Dogs (n = 34). Methods Dogs undergoing soft tissue surgeries were randomly assigned to receive either deracoxib (n = 18) or placebo (n = 16) as a preoperative treatment and again once daily for 2 additional days after surgery unless removed from the study. Dogs were evaluated before surgery and again postsurgically at predetermined times using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS). All dogs were allowed to receive another pain medication (except nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or corticosteroids) as postsurgical pain intervention if the dog scored ≥6 on the GCPS or was in obvious discomfort. Dogs receiving pain intervention were considered treatment failures and were removed from the study. Results Two of 16 dogs treated with deracoxib were rescued compared with 9 of 16 dogs receiving placebo (P = .0091). In addition, deracoxib treated dogs had numerically lower GCPS scores. Conclusions Results suggest perioperative administration of deracoxib to dogs at 1?2 mg/kg/day for 3 days significantly improves analgesia in the postoperative surgical period after soft tissue surgery. Placebo dogs not rescued after painful procedures highlight the need for refinement of current pain assessment tools.

AB  - Abstract Root resorption is a pathological process initiated by specific clastic cells which remove the organic and mineral components of dental hard tissues. Clastic cell activity in teeth is associated with a number of factors which include biomechanical forces, mechanical, surgical and chemical trauma, endodontic microorganisms and their toxins, developmental defects, neoplasia, and hormonal disturbances. The therapeutic measures which can regulate clastic activity include endodontic treatment, the use of specific anticlastic agents such as Ledermix paste, non-specific necrobiotic agents such as calcium hydroxide and trichloracetic acid, surgery or root surface conditioners. Accurate diagnosis is essential to the correct application of therapy. While some resorptions are self-limiting, others such as inflammatory root resorption require active and prompt endodontic preparation and medication to allow the control of clastic activity. One treatment regimen of invasive cervical and related conditions involves careful and accurate application of a chemical cauterising agent, trichloracetic acid, followed by curettage and restoration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate post-war context have forced us to re-think our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention. Recognizing the role of culture has allowed us to rethink trauma-in-context, how people and communities understand trauma, and how to explore the most effective psychotherapeutic treatments in these post-war cultural contexts. Dawes and Honwana (Children, culture and mental health: Interventions in Conditions of War. In B. Efraime Jr, P. Riedesser, J. Walter, H. Adam, & P. Steudtner (Eds), Children, war and persecution ? rebuilding hope. Maputo: Rebuilding Hope, 1998) suggest a holistic view of the individual-in-context in order to fully understand the meaning an individual brings and gives to a stressful experience. This perspective allows also for an understanding of the healing resources within a community available to the individual, and the psychologist, dealing with a traumatic event. By exploring both the universal and specific cultural dimensions of trauma, while working with former child soldiers on Josina Machel Island, Mozambique, the authors seek to illuminate how these cultural dimensions, and wealth of healing resources, shaped their understanding of culture in the treatment process and the creation of treatment teams. A comprehensive cultural understanding also allowed the author to use and integrate important cultural dimensions of understanding in to the treatment process to aid in the elaboration of traumatic events associated with being a child soldier. These treatment methods are described via a case example, which represents much of the work carried out with the community of Josina Machel. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract An important method of assessing experimental neurotoxic injury is the pathologic examination of the nervous system. Methods for fixation, sampling, and preparation of peripheral nervous system tissues for critical pathological neurotoxicology studies are presented. Fixation of tissue is carried out using either perfusion-fixation of laboratory animals or immersion-fixation of dissected nerve segments. Dissection of the peripheral nervous system (from perfusion-fixed animals) is done to allow for multilevel sampling. Focus is on use of epoxy resin embedding tissue sections for optimal light microscopic resolution. Protocols for processing, sectioning, and staining for light and transmission electron microscopy are provided. A protocol for teasing and microscopic study of individual myelinated fibers is provided.

AB  - Objective: To report the success of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of Nocardia brasiliensis mycetoma. We believe this to be only the second report in the medical literature of hyperbaric oxygen therapy used in the therapy of nocardial disease. Clinical features: A 78-year-old man presented to a general hospital outpatient clinic after eight months with a painless swollen left foot. There was no significant medical history, no trauma had occurred, and no foreign body had been detected. The dorsum of the foot had a discharging sinus, from which N. brasiliensis was isolated. Interventions: After unsuccessful treatment with surgical debridement and high-dose antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered in a multi place recompression chamber (one hour of treatment at 1.8 atmospheres absolute followed by a 30 minute ?ascent? to surface pressure). A total of 19 treatments were administered. Outcome: Successful healing of an N. brasiliensis mycetoma of the left foot. Conclusion: In this case of N. brasiliensis mycetoma involving the lower extremity, the conventional management of surgery and antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful, and only with the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy did clinical recovery occur.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy for canine nasal tumours, including the improvement in clinical signs, rate of complications and assessment of prognostic factors. Methods Medical records of 38 dogs with malignant nasal tumours were reviewed, and those treated with a weekly schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy were included in the study. Acute and late side effects were defined as complications noted either within 1?month or after 6?months of irradiation, respectively. Progression-free interval and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan?Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were also performed. Results Clinical signs improved in 30 of 36 dogs. Acute complications were seen in 28 of 36 dogs and were considered manageable. Late complications were observed in 17 of 30 dogs that survived 6?months or longer, but severe side effects were not observed. The median progression-free interval and overall survival was 245?days (95% CI: 127?512?days) and 512?days (95% CI: 203?820?days), respectively. Age, breed and presence of dyspnoea were negatively correlated with overall survival. Clinical Significance These results suggest that hypofractionated radiotherapy could be a viable option for the treatment of nasal tumours in dogs that are not candidates for conventional multi-fractionated radiotherapy.

Cutaneous leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are rare in comparison with their deep-seated soft tissue and uterine counterparts, and have been poorly characterized. The aim was to verify whether the clinical behaviour of purely dermal LMS is different from that of LMS with minimal subcutis invasion. Methods and results:? Twenty-one purely dermal LMS and 15 dermal LMS with minimal subcutis extension were analysed. Tumours developed in 27 men and nine women (age range 29?91?years); most tumours showed a fasciculated (n?=?23), pilar-type (n?=?12) and pleomorphic (n?=?1) pattern. During the follow-up period (range 2?192, mean 41?months) recurrences occurred in 1/16 (6.2%) of tumours confined to the dermis and in 2/11 (18.1%) tumours with minimal subcutis extension. The three recurrent tumours were high-grade LMS, two of which exhibited myxoid areas. One patient with a pleomorphic dermal LMS with minimal extension into fat developed distant metastases 15?years after diagnosis. Conclusions:  For LMS involving the skin, it is advisable to recognize and indicate in the histopathology report the depth of dermal and/or subcutaneous extension, since even minimal subcutaneous involvement may be associated with late local recurrences and/or distant metastases, and therefore appropriate and long-term follow-up is needed.
