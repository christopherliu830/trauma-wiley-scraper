AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of single- and two-segment fusion for Denis type B spinal fracture. Methods Two female patients with Denis type B L1 vertebral fractures were studied. Both patients had achieved intervertebral fusion by 1 year postoperatively, at which time CT data were collected, including data of one patient before and after removal of pedicle screws and of another whose pedicle screws were not removed. The data were imported into Mimics software and T11-L2 three dimensional models established. After construction of the models, they were imported into ANSYS software. An axial load (260?N) and 10?Nm torque were loaded to simulate the flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of the spine, respectively. Results There was no significant difference in the average displacement of the spine motion between the two-segment and single-segment fusion patients without removal of pedicle screws. However, for all motion forms, the average displacement of the single-segment fusion patient' spine after removal of pedicle screws was significantly greater than that before removal of pedicle screws and that of the two-segment fusion patient. The average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of two-segment fusion patient was significantly greater than that of the one-segment fusion patient. Moreover, the average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of single-segment fusion patient was greater before than after removal of pedicle screws. Conclusion Provided there is satisfactory interbody fusion, removal of pedicle screws after one-segment fusion can increase spinal motion, reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral discs and delay disc degeneration.

AB  - Objectives Defects in copper metabolism have been described in several dog breeds, and recently, it has been suggested that changes in other essential trace elements could be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic disease. This study measured hepatic copper accumulation and its interactions with other essential trace and toxic metals in dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis. Methods Liver samples of 20 chronic hepatitis and 20 healthy dogs were collected. Samples were acid digested, and essential metals (cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molibdenum, selenium and zinc) and toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead) were analysed by inductively?coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results Copper concentrations were significantly higher in dogs affected by hepatic disease than in controls. Dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentration greater than 100 mg/kg wet weight showed statistically higher cobalt, manganese and zinc concentrations than dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentrations less than 100 mg/kg wet weight and controls. Toxic metal concentrations were low ? in all cases below the threshold associated with toxicity in dogs. Clinical Significance Dogs with chronic hepatitis not only have increased concentrations of copper in the liver but also increased concentrations of cobalt, manganese and zinc; measurement of these elements may perhaps aid in diagnosis of liver disease in dogs.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Background:?? With the use of the three-point lap-diagonal seat belt restraint there has been a reduction in the number of deaths caused by automobile trauma. However, with the use of a restraint, a new pattern of injuries has emerged. The ?seat-belt syndrome? comprises a constellation of injuries including soft tissue injury to the breast. Given that seat-belt legislation is becoming more widespread, it is likely that the incidence and reporting of these injuries will become more common. In this paper, we provide an overview of the reported literature regarding three-point lap-diagonal seat belt injury to the female breast. We then discuss the previously unreported area of breast reconstruction in a breast deformed as a result of blunt trauma, using a specific case as an example. Methods:?? A Medline search was undertaken and all available reported literature, related to seat-belt associated breast trauma, reviewed. Results:?? A concise summary of the varied clinical and radiological presentations is given, as is their suggested management. Subsequently highlighted is the paucity of literature discussing the breast reconstruction options for a breast deformed by blunt trauma and thus, this issue is discussed using a specific case as an example. Conclusions:?? Blunt breast trauma secondary to seat-belt restraint is not only likely to become more common, but can be severe in its functional, psycho-social and aesthetic impact. This paper provides a new adjunct to the currently reported literature, especially in the area of plastic surgical reconstruction of a breast deformed by blunt trauma.

PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary Chronic activation of the stress axis caused by long-term uncontrollable and unpredictable factors in the environment has been regarded as causing maladaptive and/or pathological effects, both by those studying animals in the laboratory and in nature. While pathology may apply to the former, I argue that it does not apply to the latter. Our thinking on the role of chronic stress in animals in nature has been heavily influenced by biomedical research, but much less so by the ecological and evolutionary context within which animals actually function. I argue that when such stressors occur (e.g. periods of high predation risk, food limitation, prolonged severe weather, social conflict, etc.), although the animal may be chronically stressed, its responses are adaptive and continue to promote fitness. Chronic stressors in nature can be subdivided into whether they are reactive (direct physiological challenges threatening homeostasis and not requiring cognitive processing ? for example, food limitation) or anticipatory (perceived to be threatening and requiring cognitive processing ? for example, high predation risk). For anticipatory stressors, their impact on the animal should not be based on their absolute duration (they may be acute), but rather by the duration of their physiological consequences. The anticipatory stressor of persistent high predation risk does not elicit chronic stress in all prey classes. Cyclic snowshoe hare and arctic ground squirrels exhibit evidence of chronic stress when predator numbers are high, but cyclic vole and noncyclic elk populations do not. I suggest that chronic stress has evolved to benefit the fitness of the former and not the later, with the key factors being lifespan and life history. I propose that chronic stress evolves in a species only if it is adaptive.

AB  - Abstract Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of female death in the world. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently considered to be valuable as noninvasive cancer biomarkers, but their role in the prognosis of cervical cancer has not been elucidated. We aimed to find serum miRNAs that can be used as prognostic factors for cervical cancer. A traumatic pathological biopsy is the only reliable method for determining the severity of cervical cancer currently. Thus, noninvasive diagnostic markers are needed. The serological expression of candidate miRNAs were measured in 90 participants, including 60 patients with cervical cancer and 50 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two patients with cervical cancer were excluded from the study because of lack of data. miRNAs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-143/?4636 appeared specific for cervical cancer compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P?<?.001). The classification performance of validated miRNAs for cervical cancer [Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)?=?0.942] was better than that reached by squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag; AUC?=?0.727). Poor-differentiation group has lower miR-143/?4636 levels in serum (P?<?.05). miR-4636 level was correlated gross tumor volume and the depth of invasion (P?<?.0001). In our study, we found a combination of miR-143 and miR-4636 that is independently and strongly associated with cervical cancer prognosis and can be used as a clinically prognostic factor.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the clinical characteristics, types of vascular ring anomalies (VRA), operative findings, complications, and survival after surgical treatment of cats with VRA. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional case series. Animals Client- or shelter-owned cats presenting to academic, referral veterinary institutions. Methods Medical records of cats with VRA that underwent surgical treatment were reviewed. Signalment, relevant medical history, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, complications, and survival were recorded. Results Twenty cats with VRA were included. Vascular ring anomalies were most commonly (75% [15/20]) diagnosed in cats less than 1?year old, with no breed or sex predilection. Regurgitation was the most common clinical sign, present in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. A persistent right aortic arch was diagnosed in 17 of 20 (85%) cats, with concurrent aberrant left subclavian artery in four of the cats. Surgical treatment was associated with survival to discharge in 18 of 20 (90%) cats. Persistent clinical signs were reported in nine of 13 (69%) cats, and radiographic evidence of megaesophagus persisted in four of 13 (31%) cats, with a median follow-up of 275?days after discharge. Conclusion Persistent right aortic arch was the most commonly diagnosed VRA in cats in this series, although multiple anomalies were observed. Surgical treatment of VRA in cats was associated with a high survival to discharge, although persistence of clinical signs and megaesophagus was noted in 69% and 31% of the cats, respectively. Clinical significance Surgical treatment of VRA in cats is associated with a high survival rate; however, persistence of clinical signs is an expected outcome.

AB  - Tenascin-C (TN-C) is a hexabrachion-shaped extracellular matrix (ECM) protein which has very restricted expression in normal musculoskeletal tissues, but is expressed in large quantities in these tissues during embryogenesis as well as during regenerative and healing processes. TN-C is an elastic protein which has a number of binding sites for other extracellular matrix proteins as well as for cell membrane adhesion receptors. In addition, it can be stretched to several times its resting length, the ability of which is attributed to the stretch-induced unfolding of its fibronectin type III domains. In the musculoskeletal tissues, TN-C is present in the regions where high mechanical forces are transmitted from one tissue component to another, such as the myotendinous and osteotendinous junctions. Not surprisingly, it was recently presented that the expression of TN-C in the musculoskeletal tissues is regulated by the mechanical strain applied to their cells. Thus, taking into account the flexible structure of the TN-C and its site-specific expression pattern at sites exposed to heavy mechanical loads, TN-C is likely to play an important role in providing elasticity to the musculoskeletal tissues. This feature has a special significance in the degenerative and regenerative processes where the normal biomechanical environment of the musculoskeletal tissue is temporarily interrupted by injury. The rapidly increasing understanding of the structure and function of the ECM protein TN-C may well bring important insights into the clinical treatment of sports injuries in the future.

AB  - A nine-year-old female Rottweiler presented with a 6-week history of progressive impairment of hindlimb adduction. Clinical examination showed abduction of both hind legs when walking on a smooth surface, pain at the medial surface of the left thigh, and an intrarectal palpable mass at the pelvic floor. Electromyography demonstrated fibrillation potentials in the adductor muscles on both sides. Pelvic radiographs showed severe osteolysis of the ischium. Gross post-mortem examination following euthanasia disclosed a large retroperitoneal mass, invading the obturator foramina and compressing both obturator nerves. Histopathological examination revealed a high-grade anaplastic sarcoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells labelled positively for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin, hence the tumour was considered a ?myofibroblastic fibrosarcoma?. This unique case report describes a novel cause of obturator neuropathy in veterinary medicine. To date, clinical descriptions of obturator nerve lesions have been limited to pelvic fractures in small animals and following difficult labour in large animals.

AB  - Abstract Although intellectual decline associated with alcohol use has been extensively documented, the neuropathological basis for this cognitive change remains controversial. We have therefore undertaken a naturalistic survey of a population of patients identified as having an excessive alcohol intake. Records of all autopsies on patients resident in a chronic hospital between 1983 and 1993 were reviewed for evidence of alcohol abuse. Multiple brain pathology was found in the demented alcoholic patients. The most unexpected finding in this series was that seven of 12 cases of dementia with history of alcohol abuse presented with significant cerebrovascular disease, meeting NINDS? AIREN criteria for vascular dementia, suggesting that cerebrovascular disease may be a significant component of dementia in older alcoholics. Our finding that in four of six cases mamillary pathology may be secondary to vascular lesions suggests that unless these lesions are sought, the presence of mamillary pathology may lead to overdiagnosis of nutritional factors as the basis for alcoholic dementia.

AB  - Abstract Objectives We tested the hypothesis that the purported unstable climate in the South Urals region during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA) resulted in health instability and social stress as evidenced by skeletal response. Methods The skeletal sample (n?=?99) derived from Kamennyi Ambar 5 (KA-5), a MBA kurgan cemetery (2040-1730 cal. BCE, 2 sigma) associated with the Sintashta culture. Skeletal stress indicators assessed included cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and tibia periosteal new bone growth. Dental disease (caries, abscess, calculus, and periodontitis) and trauma were scored. Results were compared to regional data from the nearby Samara Valley, spanning the Early to Late Bronze Age (EBA, LBA). Results Lesions were minimal for the KA-5 and MBA-LBA groups except for periodontitis and dental calculus. No unambiguous weapon injuries or injuries associated with violence were observed for the KA-5 group; few injuries occurred at other sites. Subadults (<18 years) formed the majority of each sample. At KA-5, subadults accounted for 75% of the sample with 10% (n?=?10) estimated to be 14-18 years of age. Conclusions Skeletal stress markers and injuries were uncommon among the KA-5 and regional groups, but a MBA-LBA high subadult mortality indicates elevated frailty levels and inability to survive acute illnesses. Following an optimal weaning program, subadults were at risk for physiological insult and many succumbed. Only a small number of individuals attained biological maturity during the MBA, suggesting that a fast life history was an adaptive regional response to a less hospitable and perhaps unstable environment.

AB  - ABSTRACT A total of 181 dermatologically healthy pet cats from 177 different households, attending a veterinary clinic, were sampled for the presence of dermatophytes by a modified MacKenzie hair brush technique. Microsporum canis was the only dermatophyte recovered and was isolated from four cats (2.2 per cent) from four different households. In addition to clinical details, owners were questioned about the environment and management of all the cats sampled. The data regarding the cats from which M canis was recovered showed little variation from that of the culture-negative cats except that all four cats were from multi-cat (more than two cats) households, whereas only 35 per cent of the culture-negative cats were from a similar environment. The viability of M canis in infected feline hairs stored at room temperature was maintained for between 13 and 18 months.

AB  - Summary Fibrosis by common usage in the pathological and clinical literature is the end result of a healing process and synonymous with scarring. We would argue that its use to describe a dynamic series of events which may be reversible is unhelpful and that the term ?lung remodelling? is a better description for this process as it reflects changes in tissue organization that may or may not progress to ?fibrosis? as a final fixed point. Resolution, through reversal of active lung remodelling, by therapeutic intervention is possible providing the alveolar architecture remains intact. If the lung architecture is lost then healing by permanent fibrosis with loss of organ function is inevitable.

AB  - Objectives: To study forms of congenital heart disease present in a family of beagle dogs with a strong prevalence of ventricular septal defect and to document the pathological findings associated with the ventricular septal defects and investigate the mode of transmission. Methods: The animals were investigated by physical examination, radiography, electrocardiography and ultrasonography to diagnose the presence of congenital heart disease. Some animals were diagnosed at post-mortem examination and the dead animals underwent post-mortem examination to verify the presence of ventricular septal defect. An analysis of pedigree was undertaken and two of the affected animals were mated to investigate the mode of transmission. Results: Among the 28 dogs evaluated clinically or by post-mortem examination, 14 cases of ventricular septal defect were identified. The post-mortem examination showed some abnormalities of the ventricular outflow region associated with malformation of conotruncal septum development. When two affected dogs were bred, congenital heart disease was present in all of the offspring. Clinical Significance: The congenital heart disease identified in this beagle family can be classified as conotruncal malformation, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was suggested by pedigree analysis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Alteration of deep cartilage matrix has been observed following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, evidenced by elevated MRI UTE-T2* values measured in small, 2-D cartilage regions of interest. This Level I diagnostic study seeks to more thoroughly evaluate deep cartilage matrix changes to medial tibiofemoral UTE-T2* maps 2 years after ACL reconstruction and examine the relative utilities of 3-D compared to 2-D assessments of cartilage UTE-T2* maps. Thirty-eight ACL-reconstructed and 20 uninjured subjects underwent MRI UTE-T2* mapping. ?Small? single mid-sagittal 2-D and larger 3-D ?tread mark? regions of interest were manually segmented and found to be correlated in medial cartilage (r?>?0.58, p?<?0.005). 3-D analyses of UTE-T2* maps showed differences to medial tibial cartilage between ACL-reconstructed and uninjured subjects (p?=?0.007) that were not detected by smaller 2-D regions (p?>?0.46). Quantitative comparisons show 14/38 (37%) ACL-reconstructed subjects have values >2 standard deviations higher than uninjured controls. Among a subset of ACL-reconstructed subjects with no morphologic MRI evidence of medial tibiofemoral cartilage or meniscal pathology (n?=?12), elevated UTE-T2* values in ?small? 2-D femoral (p?=?0.011), but not larger 3-D tread mark regions of interest (p?>?0.13), were observed. These data show the utility of 2-D UTE-T2* assessments of mid-sagittal weight-bearing regions of medial femoral cartilage for identifying subclinical deep cartilage matrix changes 2 years after ACLR. Clinical Significance: Mid-sagittal single slice 2-D UTE-T2* mapping may be an efficient means to assess medial femoral cartilage for subsurface matrix changes early after ACL reconstruction while 3-D assessments provide additional sensitivity to changes in the medial tibial plateau. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
