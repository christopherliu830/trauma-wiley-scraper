AB  - Abstract Aim: This series of case reports evaluated the impact of adhesive crown?root fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth suffering from crown?root fractures on various parameters of periodontal health over a time course of 2 years. Material and Methods: A total of 20 teeth with crown?root fractures in 18 periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated. After open-flap access, crown?root fragments were adhesively reattached to the root stub. In all cases, the vertical difference between the alveolar bone crest and the fracture line was 1?mm, i.e. violating the biological width. Subsequently, clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP) and gingival index (GI) scores were recorded at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively for the restored teeth as well as plaque index (PlI) and periodontal screening index (PSI) values for the whole dentition. Results: Two years after therapy, recorded CAL, PPD, BoP, GI, PlI and PSI scores revealed healthy periodontal conditions in 18 out of 20 treated teeth. Two teeth had suffered again from fragment fracture due to new traumata. Conclusions: Adhesive fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth affected by crown?root fractures had no detrimental impact on periodontal health over a time course of 2 years.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to establish a new experimental model of hematogenous implant-related infection (IRI) by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain. Cylindrical porous tantalum intramedullary implants were inserted in the proximal right tibia of 30 male white rabbits after administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Four weeks later and without antibiotic prophylaxis, 20 animals received 1 ml of inoculum of two different concentrations (study groups A and B) of CA-MRSA strain through an ipsilatelar femoral artery catheter. The remaining 10 received normal saline instead (control group C). Surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later. Sterile bone, bone marrow biopsies, and implants were harvested for culture and histological evaluation. Ten animals receiving 5???108cfu/ml (group A) died within 48?72 h due to septic shock. Blood cultures were positive; histology demonstrated acute infection. Ten animals received bacterial load of 3???108cfu/ml (group B) and all survived; two had negative Gram-stain and cultures but PCR and RT-PCR results demonstrated the viability of the microorganisms, while periprosthetic osteolysis and histological evaluation indicated subacute osteomyelitis; eight animals established periprosthetic infection, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis documented by positive Gram-stain, cultures, subperiosteal reaction, and chronic infection on histology. Control group specimens demonstrated no signs of infection. Histopathological semiquantitative scoring was used to compare the three groups. Comparison of groups A and B with control group and between group A and B showed statistically significant difference (p?<?0.05) in all parameters except for periosteal reaction between groups B and C (p?=?0.354). This novel, reproducible experimental model will facilitate the study of hematogenous CA-MRSA IRIs. ? 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumors are uncommon mesenchymal neoplasms frequently observed in middle-aged adults and are classified, according to the WHO classification of soft tissue tumors, as part of the hemangiopericytoma tumor group. However, these two entities remain separated in the WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system. In fact, meningeal solitary fibrous tumors are believed to be benign lesion and only in a minority of cases local relapses have been described, although detailed survival clinical studies on solitary fibrous tumors of meninges are rare. In contrast to hemangiopericytoma, which frequently shows distant extracranial metastases, such an event is exceptional in patients with meningeal solitary fibrous tumors and has been clinically reported in a handful of cases only and their histopathological features have not been investigated in detail. In this report, we describe the detailed clinico-pathological features of a meningeal solitary fibrous tumor presenting during a 17-year follow-up period, multiple intra-, extracranial relapses and lung metastases.

AB  - Abstract microRNAs are functional, 22 nt, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Herpetic whitlow, a herpes simplex virus infection involving the digits, most commonly presents as a vesicular eruption involving a single digit. Diagnosis of herpetic whitlow can usually be made with the history of exposure, the characteristic vesicular eruption, and a positive Tzank smear and/or viral culture. We describe a case of herpetic whitlow in a patient finishing 6 cycles of chemotherapy for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia that presented with a bilateral, multi-digit, crusted eruption of the hands. This is an illustrative case of an immunocompromised host status altering appearance and course of cutaneous disease such that the history and physical exam alone may not help in diagnosing atypical presentations of herpetic infections. This case underscores the necessity for clinico-histopathologic correlation. Am. J. Hematol. 69:285?288, 2002. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Abstract Elevated intraocular pressure may lead to retinal ganglion cell injury and consequent visual deficits. Chronic intraocular pressure increase is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a leading blinding disease, and permanent visual deficits can also occur following acute pressure increments due to trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery. How pressure affects retinal neurons is not firmly established. Mechanical damage at the optic nerve head, reduced blood supply, inflammation and cytotoxic factors have all been called into play. Reasoning that the analysis of retinal neurons soon after pressure elevation would provide useful cues, we imaged individual ganglion cells in isolated rat retinas before and after short hydrostatic pressure increments. We found that slowly rising pressure to peaks observed in trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery (50?90?mmHg) did not damage ganglion cells, whereas a rapid 1?min pulse to 50?mmHg injured 30% of these cells within 1?h. The severity of damage and the number of affected cells increased with stronger or repeated insults. Degrading extracellular ATP or blocking the P2X receptors for ATP prevented acute pressure-induced damage in ganglion cells. Similar effects were observed in?vivo. A short intraocular pressure transient increased extracellular ATP levels in the eye fluids and damaged ganglion cells within 1?h. Reducing extracellular ATP in the eye prevented damage to ganglion cells and accelerated recovery of their response to light. These data show that rapid pressure transients induce acute ganglion cell injury and unveil the causal role of extracellular ATP elevation in such injury.

AB  - Cutaneous small blue cell tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms whose differential includes primary adnexal, neuroendocrine and lymphoproliferative tumors, as well as metastatic lesions. Another entity to be considered in the differential is Ewing?s sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). We present a 19-year-old female who developed a solitary, subcutaneous mass on her back. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated, cellular, nodular neoplasm of small, blue cells containing round to ovoid, vesicular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cam 5.2 and CD99. Overall, the lesion resembled an malignant spiradenoma (spiradenocarcinoma). CD99 reactivity prompted analysis with dual-color interphase FISH for translocations involving (22q12), which was positive, a sensitive marker for ES/PNET. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of ES/PNET should be considered in the differential of primary cutaneous blue cell tumors. These lesions are difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous small blue cell tumors due to their rarity and because the diagnosis is often not considered at this site.

AB  - Focal metatarsal sinus tracts (?fistulation?) are, to the authors knowledge, reported for the first time in a Weimaraner. The six-year-old, entire male had a five-month history of two symmetrical, well-demarcated sinuses on the plantar aspect of each metatarsus. The area surrounding each pair of sinuses was slightly fluctuant and a serosanguineous discharge could be expressed. Cytological examination of the discharge was characteristic of pyogranulomatous inflammation. Bacterial culture showed the material to be sterile. Examination of a skin biopsy revealed a severe inflammatory reaction involving the dermal collagen, with an infiltrate of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and multi-nucleated giant cells, with some micro-pustule formation. Treatment with ciclosporin induced total remission. Reduction of the dose of ciclosporin resulted in recurrence of the physical signs with further remission on re-introduction of the original dosage. This is the first report of the use of ciclosporin to control this condition.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ankle fractures are among the most common lower limb fractures. Associations between postoperative radiographic results and clinical outcome have been found, but less is known about the relevant ankle biomechanics. This study analyzed ankle kinematics, radiographic findings, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in patients treated for ankle fractures. The hypothesis was that patients after ankle fracture surgery had less flexion/extension in the ankle compared to healthy subjects and that fracture severity had significant influence on kinematics and patient satisfaction. Thirty-three patients (n?=?33 feet) operated for ankle fractures were recruited. Ankle kinematics were analyzed using the Oxford Foot model, and results were compared with an age-matched healthy control group (11 patients, 20 feet). In addition, patients were divided by fracture (severity) classification and kinematic results were correlated with PROM and radiographic findings. Patients treated for ankle fracture showed lower walking speed (p?<?0.001) when asked to walk in preferred normal speed. When compared at equal speed, significantly less range of motion (ROM) between the hindfoot and tibia in the sagittal plane (flexion/extension) during loading and push-off phases (p?=?0.003 and p?<?0.001) was found in patients after ankle fractures compared to healthy subjects. Lowest ROM and poorest PROM results were found for patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures. There was a significant correlation between ROM (flexion/extension) during the push-off phase and SF-36 physical functioning (r2?=?0.403, p?=?0.027) and SF-36 general health (r2?=?0.473, p?=?0.008). Fracture severity was significantly correlated with flexion/extension ROM in the ankle during both loading and push-off phases (r2?=??0.382, p?=?0.005, and r2?=??0.568, p?<?0.001) and was also significantly correlated with PROM. This study found that patients with ankle fractures had significantly altered ankle kinematics compared to healthy subjects. The poorest results were found among patients with trimalleolar fractures. Weak to strong significant correlations were found between fracture severity, ankle kinematics, and PROM. ? 2019 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma patients without lymph node metastases (Stage II) have a variable five-year survival. The influence of falsely negative lymph nodes on this variability is unknown. DESIGN: The Poisson distribution describes the probability of finding no positive lymph nodes when a certain number are examined. Using this model, we analysed lymph node dissection results from 780 patients with melanoma and published survival results for Stage II patients. RESULTS: In the 294 patients without positive nodes, 18% had fewer than 7 nodes examined. The Poisson probability of finding no positive nodes when 1 to 6 were examined ranged from 0.4 to to 0.8 (mean 0.6). We partitioned survival for stage II into two categories: those with truly negative nodes with a five-year survival of 80% and those with a five-year survival matching Stage III (46%). The observed five-year survival of 77% in Stage II patients implied that the fraction with false negative nodes was also 18%, which corresponded with the subgroup with fewer than 7 nodes examined. CONCLUSION: The Poisson model suggests that the variable survival in Stage II patients may reflect the incorrect staging of patients with stage III melanoma who have limited numbers of lymph nodes examined.

Surgical resection of the mass, including a complete removal of the adjacent nuchal ligament, resulted in improvement in the signs of neck stiffness. Histopathological examination identified the mass as calcinosis circumscripta. These lesions do not appear to have been reported at this site nor has outcome following excision of a complete section of the nuchal ligament.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Summary The pathologic changes of preeclampsia can affect every organ system and consequently may significantly compromise both mother and fetus. Many of these end-organ and cellular changes affect decisions the anesthesia and delivery team make, from timing and route of delivery to type of anesthesia and postpartum care. This chapter reviews the evidence that should guide the care of a mother affected by severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, including the diagnosis of preeclampsia, management of acute hypertension, effect of regional and general anesthesia on both mother and fetus and the impact of common medical complications of preeclampsia, focusing on how they change anesthetic management and care.

AB  - Primary brain tumours of a single histological type and metastatic brain tumours are well described in dogs in the current veterinary literature. However, the concurrent presence of a primary and secondary tumour in the brain of a dog has never, to the authors? knowledge, been previously reported. The clinical and pathological features of a nine-year-old, female boxer with an oligodendroglioma and metastases from a mammary gland adenocarcinoma occurring simultaneously in the brain are described in this case report. Information in the veterinary literature on multiple malignancies affecting the central nervous system is very limited; therefore, a discussion about comparative situations in human medicine has been included.

AB  - Abstract The biliary system originates in the small biliary canaliculi and eventually drains into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater. Although a wide variety of liver diseases can involve the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, the four that most frequently occur in adult livers are the following: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic and large intrahepatic mechanical bile duct obstruction (BDO), and secondary (acquired) sclerosing cholangitis (SSC). These disorders each have characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and are discussed in detail in this chapter. Additionally autoimmune hepatitis that attacks bile ducts (autoimmune cholangitis) is also briefly mentioned in the section on differential diagnoses. Finally, the chapter compares PBC, PSC, and large duct obstruction and the various histologic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features aiding in the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract:? This study aims to study the influence of childhood adversity on suicidal behavior in male prisoners. Including a random sample of 899 male prisoners (French National Mental Health Prison Survey, 2003), this paper studied suicidal ideations and suicide attempts using MINI criteria, and personality using Temperament and Character Inventory. Risk factors of suicidality were examined, and structural equations studied the influence of childhood trauma on suicidality, mediated by personality dimensions. The prisoners reported high levels of childhood adversity. More than a third reported recent suicidal ideations. Childhood adversity and dimensions of personality were associated with suicidality. Structural equations showed that childhood adversity was positively associated with suicidality, mediated by poor dimensions of character (affective stability, self-cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In conclusion, these results confirm the importance of screening and treatment of childhood trauma among male prisoners. They suggest the importance to study dimensions of personality and tailor treatment to specific needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:?To determine the individual and combined effects of potential risk factors in relation to the temporomandibular disorder, Pain Dysfunction Syndrome (PDS). DESIGN:?Case?control study. MATERIAL AND METHODS:?Cases were new referrals to the temporomandibular disorder clinic of the University Dental Hospital of Manchester, diagnosed with PDS. Controls were randomly selected from 24 dental practices. Using a postal questionnaire information was collected on socio-demographic, local mechanical, psychological factors, co-morbidities and illness behaviour. The adjusted participation rate was similar in cases and controls (64%), and 131 cases and 196 controls finally participated in the study. RESULTS:?Compared with the controls, the cases were more likely to report that their teeth felt as though they did not fit together properly [odds ratio (OR) 8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6?13] and report history of facial trauma (OR 3, 95% CI 2?6). Both diurnal and nocturnal grinding were significantly associated with PDS, and individuals who reported grinding their teeth both during the day and at night had a risk of 6; 95% CI 3?13 for PDS compared with those who did not. A history of orthodontic treatment, having any dentures, having missing teeth, use of chewing gum or biting the fingernails did not show any relationship with PDS. People who took medication for the bowels had a higher risk of PDS (OR 2, 95% CI 1?4). Participants with frequent headaches had a threefold increase in risk of having PDS (OR 3, 95% CI 2?5) while having pain in parts of the body other than the head was associated with an OR of 3 (95% CI 2?5). An increased propensity to have PDS was seen in those individuals with higher levels of psychological distress (OR 3; 95% CI 1?4 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001) and sleep disturbance (OR 5; 95% CI 2?94 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001). Aspects of illness behaviour, such as disease conviction (OR 4; 95% CI 2?9 in the highest category) and perception of illness (0.3; 95% CI 0.2?0.5) were associated with PDS. The result for the denial scale became statistically significant after adjustment for age and gender (2; 95% CI 1?3). CONCLUSIONS:?The current case?control study provides complementary epidemiological information on oro-facial pain (OFP) and supports a multifactorial aetiology of PDS, with factors from many domains, including local mechanical factors, psychological and co-morbidities. People with PDS were characterized by frequent headaches, history of facial trauma, teeth grinding, sleep problems, pain elsewhere in the body and high levels of psychological distress. From the results of current study and available evidence it seems inappropriate to consider PDS in isolation and future research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to OFP.
