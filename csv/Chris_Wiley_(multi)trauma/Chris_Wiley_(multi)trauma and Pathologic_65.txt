AB  - Abstract The biliary system originates in the small biliary canaliculi and eventually drains into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater. Although a wide variety of liver diseases can involve the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, the four that most frequently occur in adult livers are the following: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic and large intrahepatic mechanical bile duct obstruction (BDO), and secondary (acquired) sclerosing cholangitis (SSC). These disorders each have characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and are discussed in detail in this chapter. Additionally autoimmune hepatitis that attacks bile ducts (autoimmune cholangitis) is also briefly mentioned in the section on differential diagnoses. Finally, the chapter compares PBC, PSC, and large duct obstruction and the various histologic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features aiding in the diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:?To determine the individual and combined effects of potential risk factors in relation to the temporomandibular disorder, Pain Dysfunction Syndrome (PDS). DESIGN:?Case?control study. MATERIAL AND METHODS:?Cases were new referrals to the temporomandibular disorder clinic of the University Dental Hospital of Manchester, diagnosed with PDS. Controls were randomly selected from 24 dental practices. Using a postal questionnaire information was collected on socio-demographic, local mechanical, psychological factors, co-morbidities and illness behaviour. The adjusted participation rate was similar in cases and controls (64%), and 131 cases and 196 controls finally participated in the study. RESULTS:?Compared with the controls, the cases were more likely to report that their teeth felt as though they did not fit together properly [odds ratio (OR) 8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6?13] and report history of facial trauma (OR 3, 95% CI 2?6). Both diurnal and nocturnal grinding were significantly associated with PDS, and individuals who reported grinding their teeth both during the day and at night had a risk of 6; 95% CI 3?13 for PDS compared with those who did not. A history of orthodontic treatment, having any dentures, having missing teeth, use of chewing gum or biting the fingernails did not show any relationship with PDS. People who took medication for the bowels had a higher risk of PDS (OR 2, 95% CI 1?4). Participants with frequent headaches had a threefold increase in risk of having PDS (OR 3, 95% CI 2?5) while having pain in parts of the body other than the head was associated with an OR of 3 (95% CI 2?5). An increased propensity to have PDS was seen in those individuals with higher levels of psychological distress (OR 3; 95% CI 1?4 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001) and sleep disturbance (OR 5; 95% CI 2?94 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001). Aspects of illness behaviour, such as disease conviction (OR 4; 95% CI 2?9 in the highest category) and perception of illness (0.3; 95% CI 0.2?0.5) were associated with PDS. The result for the denial scale became statistically significant after adjustment for age and gender (2; 95% CI 1?3). CONCLUSIONS:?The current case?control study provides complementary epidemiological information on oro-facial pain (OFP) and supports a multifactorial aetiology of PDS, with factors from many domains, including local mechanical factors, psychological and co-morbidities. People with PDS were characterized by frequent headaches, history of facial trauma, teeth grinding, sleep problems, pain elsewhere in the body and high levels of psychological distress. From the results of current study and available evidence it seems inappropriate to consider PDS in isolation and future research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to OFP.

AB  - Summary Polyps of the colon are defined as mucosal projections and encompass a wide range of lesions. The most common polyp is the conventional adenoma, which includes tubular, tubulovillous and villous adenoma. These are classified according to architectural features, and graded according to the severity of dysplasia. Some lesions show progression to adenocarcinoma, and these lesions must be carefully assessed histologically to determine whether conservative management is appropriate. More recently, it has been recognised that there are other pre-malignant polyps with a serrated cryptal architecture. These lesions encompass sessile serrated adenoma, mixed polyps and traditional serrated adenoma, and these may be related to at least some hyperplastic polyps. The progression of serrated adenomas to adenocarcinoma may involve different genetic pathways and these are under continued investigation. Polyposis syndromes associated with all of these lesions are described. Finally, other neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps of variable frequency are outlined.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on spontaneous conditions seen in conventionally raised mice, conditions that often differ from those seen in laboratory mice. Mycoplasma pulmonis, an important agent of chronic murine respiratory disease, has been eradicated largely from laboratory mouse colonies but remains a very important infection of mice raised and housed under conventional conditions. Subclinical infections are common with M. pulmonis, and signs may not manifest until late in the course of the disease. Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are two different mouse paramyxoviruses that historically have been very important as causes of murine respiratory disease in laboratory settings. Enteric parasitic infections are common in pet and wild mice. Good hygiene, good nutrition, and colony management can help to reduce the severity of signs seen because infections are transmitted by ingestion of eggs, infective cysts, or larvae found in the environment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dilated cardiomyopathy is the usual cause of congestive heart failure in the dobermann pinscher and was the presumptive diagnosis in an eight-year-old female dobermann pinscher presented for dyspnoea and syncope. This was supported by thoracic radiography and electrocardiographic evidence of ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram revealed a left atrial tumour as the principal cause of cardiac failure. Pathological examination confirmed that the tumour was a large aortic body carcinoma in an unusual location. Multifocal myocardial infarctions were also found. This unusual case demonstrates the importance of a complete cardiological examination as part of a diagnostic work up and confirms the necessity of echocardiography as one of the examination methods.

AB  - ABSTRACT On 4 June 1629, the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) Retourschip Batavia wrecked on Morning Reef in the Houtman Abrolhos, approximately 65?km off the Western Australian coast. The macabre events that followed the wrecking saw more than 100 individuals murdered over a three-month period by mutineers attempting to establish control of the surviving crew and passengers. The mutineers, however, never realised their ultimate objective of hijacking the anticipated rescue ship, and most were instead duly executed in the Abrolhos. Cultural and physical material directly associated with the Batavia mutiny has since been recovered, primarily from Beacon Island, which was the focal area of the mutinous attempts to establish control. Between 1960 and 1964, four individual burials were recovered on Beacon Island; a further six individuals were recovered from a multiple grave that was excavated in stages between 1994 and 2001. The focus of the present study, however, is to briefly describe the skeletal remains of the multiple burial individuals only, including their demographics (sex, age and stature) and descriptions of potential palaeopathology (trauma, nutritional deficiencies and disease). Osteological analyses indicated an unbalanced sex ratio in favour of males; the age at death distribution ranges from about 8 months to no older than 35?49 years. It appears that prior to their untimely demise, the multiple burial individuals were mostly healthy, with relatively little evidence of disease, illness or ante-mortem trauma.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of cefovecin (ConveniaTM; Pfizer Animal Health) in the treatment of urinary tract infections in dogs. Methods: A multi-centre, blinded, randomised study was conducted in 129 dogs with urinary tract infections. Cephalexin (RilexineTM) administered twice daily at 15 mg/kg bodyweight orally for 14 days was compared with a single, subcutaneous injection of cefovecin (ConveniaTM) in dogs. The primary efficacy parameter assessed was bacterial elimination of the pretreatment uropathogen. Results: One hundred and twenty-nine dogs were included in efficacy assessments. Escherichia coli was eliminated in 90·5 per cent of cefovecin-treated dogs compared with 52·9 per cent of cephalexin-treated dogs (P=0·0004). Overall cure rates for dogs with Escherichia coli infections were 79·1 per cent for cefovecin and 36·4 per cent for cephalexin-treated dogs (P=0·0003). There were no suspected adverse drug reactions attributed to treatment with cefovecin or cephalexin. Clinical Significance: Cefovecin was shown to be an effective and safe treatment for urinary tract infections.

AB  - An 8-year-old male presented with several 1?4?cm, indurated, brownish-red nodules with superficial, punctate hemorrhagic crusts localized to the groin, which developed over several weeks. An initial biopsy was consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A work up, including a chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Treatment with a chemotherapeutic protocol resulted in shrinkage of both the mediastinal and cutaneous lesions. Late in the course of treatment the cutaneous lesions rapidly recurred and spread to various sites. A second skin biopsy showed an extensive diffuse infiltrate of histiocytic-appearing cells extending from the papillary dermis into the superficial subcutis. The cells had markedly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures were present. The neoplastic cells were S-100 protein and CD1a positive by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was Langerhans cell sarcoma. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor gamma gene in specimens from both the mediastinal mass and one of the recurrent cutaneous lesions. The sizes of the PCR products were identical demonstrating a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, functional, noncoding RNAs of 19 to 23 nucleotides which induce degradation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thus controlling the translational process (ie, synthesis of proteins from mRNAs). In addition, mRNAs regulate the promoter of specific miRNAs activating an autoregulatory feedback loop. Purpose: Titanium and zirconium dioxide ceramics (ZDCs) are used to make dental implants. Because the molecular mechanism by which ZDC and Ti act on osteoblasts is incompletely understood, we attempted to get more information by comparing the effect of ZDC and Ti on osteoblast miRNAs. Materials and Methods: By using miRNA microarray technique, we identified in osteoblast-like cell line (MG63) grown on grade 3 Ti and ZDC disks several miRNAs whose expression was modified. We collected mRNAs after 24 hours of cell culturing to better understand molecular events related to early bone healing around inserted implants. An mRNA microarray technique was then performed as a control. Results: There were six up- and four down-regulated miRNAs. Because every miRNA regulates hundreds of genes, we focused only on those related to bone formation. Among them, the most notable are BMP4 and 7, which are both up-regulated in osteoblasts cultured on Ti disks. Conclusion: The detected miRNAs differentially expressed in osteoblast-like cells grown on ZDC versus Ti act on a limited number of miRNAs and bone-related genes. The most notable are BMP4 and 7, which are more expressed in osteoblasts exposed to Ti surface. Consequently, we suggest that Ti surfaces could provide some advantages to immediate load implantology.

AB  - Donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver grafts are associated with inferior clinical outcomes and high discard rates because of poor graft quality. We investigated the predictive value of DCD liver biopsy for the pretransplant graft quality evaluation. DCD liver transplants that took place between October 2010 and April 2014 were included (n?=?127). Histological features of graft biopsy samples were analyzed to assess risk factors for graft survival. Macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.973; P?=?0.045] and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate (HR?=?6.969; P?=?0.005) were confirmed as independent risk factors for graft survival; hepatocellular swelling, vacuolation, and necrosis failed to show prognostic value. Additionally, a donor serum total bilirubin level?≥?34.2 ?mol/L was also associated with a lower probability of graft survival. Our analysis indicates that macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate are novel and useful histological markers for DCD liver grafts with unacceptable quality. This finding can be used by transplant surgeons to improve DCD liver acceptance protocols. Liver Transpl 21:838?846, 2015. ? 2015 AASLD.

The causes include trauma, obturator hernia, pelvic cancer, pelvic surgery, hip surgery, following pelvic fractures, endometriosis, retroperitoneal hematoma, pregnancy, and delivery. Ultrasound (US) guidance facilitates real-time imaging, identification of vascular structures, and improves patient comfort in situations where nerve stimulation can be unpleasant. This is a case report of ON successfully treated with US-guided steroid injection. A 55-year-old man was referred to the pain clinic with groin pain and allodynia in the medial thigh and knee following a fall. He had tried multiple other therapies and none of them provided significant relief. Using a 10?5-MHz multi-frequency, 38-mm linear array transducer, the obturator nerve was scanned in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Under real-time imaging 10?mg of medroxy-progesterone in a volume of 1?mL was injected. Following the injection, a small area of the medial side of knee was still tender to light touch. A second injection was placed inferiorly and provided pain relief for more than 5 months. This successful demonstration of US guidance in ON may further encourage US guidance in pain clinic interventions.??

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Abstract Objective We aimed to study the occurrence and development of axonal pathology and the influence of astrocytes in vanishing white matter. Methods Axons and myelin were analyzed using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry on Eif2b4 and Eif2b5 single- and double-mutant mice and patient brain tissue. In addition, astrocyte-forebrain co-culture studies were performed. Results In the corpus callosum of Eif2b5-mutant mice, myelin sheath thickness, axonal diameter, and G-ratio developed normally up to 4 months. At 7 months, however, axons had become thinner, while in control mice axonal diameters had increased further. Myelin sheath thickness remained close to normal, resulting in an abnormally low G-ratio in Eif2b5-mutant mice. In more severely affected Eif2b4-Eif2b5 double-mutants, similar abnormalities were already present at 4 months, while in milder affected Eif2b4 mutants, few abnormalities were observed at 7 months. Additionally, from 2 months onward an increased percentage of thin, unmyelinated axons and increased axonal density were present in Eif2b5-mutant mice. Co-cultures showed that Eif2b5 mutant astrocytes induced increased axonal density, also in control forebrain tissue, and that control astrocytes induced normal axonal density, also in mutant forebrain tissue. In vanishing white matter patient brains, axons and myelin sheaths were thinner than normal in moderately and severely affected white matter. In mutant mice and patients, signs of axonal transport defects and cytoskeletal abnormalities were minimal. Interpretation In vanishing white matter, axons are initially normal and atrophy later. Astrocytes are central in this process. If therapy becomes available, axonal pathology may be prevented with early intervention.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Detailed oral and dental examination is best performed under general anaesthesia. This allows tests such as pocket depth assessment and intra-oral radiography to be optimally performed. A dental chart is used as a tool to allow efficient recording of information for diagnostic, monitoring and medico-legal purposes. Quantitative measurements and indices are used to score pathology where possible. This information is used in parallel with additional tests, both systemic and local, e.g. blood biochemistry and histopathology respectively, in order to reach a diagnosis and prognosis for the individual's oral status and specific dentition where appropriate. It is vital to thoroughly examine both extra-oral and intra-oral areas and soft and hard tissues alike.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: To improve the understanding of exercise related sudden death in Thoroughbred racehorses. Objectives: To describe the post mortem findings in cases of sudden death associated with exercise in 268 Thoroughbred racehorses. Methods: Gross and histological post mortem findings of 268 cases of sudden death were collated and reviewed. Cases originated from 6 racing jurisdictions around the world. Sudden death was defined as acute collapse and death in a closely observed and previously apparently healthy Thoroughbred racehorse, during, or within one hour after, exercise. Cause of death as determined by the attending pathologist was categorised as definitive, presumptive or unexplained and compared between the different populations. Cardiopulmonary lesions recorded at post mortem examination were compared between different populations. Results: Pathologists recorded a definitive cause of death in 53% (143/268) of cases. Major definitive causes of sudden death included cardiac failure, apparent pulmonary failure, pulmonary haemorrhage, haemorrhage associated with pelvic fractures or with idiopathic blood vessel rupture, and spinal cord injury. A presumptive cause of death was made in 25% (67/268) of cases and death remained unexplained in 22% (58/268) of cases. There were several statistically significant inter-population differences in the cause of death and in reporting of cardiopulmonary lesions. Conclusions: Sudden death can be attributed to a variety of causes. Causes of sudden death and the lesions found in cases of exercise-related sudden death are similar in different racing jurisdictions. However, the lesions are often not specific for the cause of death and determination of the cause of death is therefore affected by interpretation by the individual pathologist.

AB  - The histology of melanocytic nevi in elderly patients often differs from nevi in younger adults. Our hypothesis was that nevi in patients3 60?yrs would demonstrate histologic patterns different from nevi in younger adults. Biopsies of nevi (n?=?214) from 172 patients3 60?yrs (mean age 69?±?7?yrs) were examined by three dermatopathologists and a consensus diagnosis was rendered. Control specimens (n?=?82) from 58 patients 20?40?yrs (mean age 31?±?5?yrs) were evaluated. Compound melanocytic nevi were commoner in younger patients (37%) versus older patients (12%)(p?<?.0001). Junctional melanocytic nevi were more frequently diagnosed in older patients (10% versus 3%; p?=?.027) and a lentiginous, often heavily pigmented, growth pattern was common (12% of nevi) vs control group (3%; p?=?.028). Atypical (?dysplastic?) nevi had a similar frequency at all ages, however 12/214 nevi in elderly patients (6%) exhibited marked atypia with features suggesting melanoma in-situ. We conclude that benign junctional nevi are relatively common in elderly patients and that a lentiginous, heavily pigmented growth pattern, typically associated with younger patients, is often seen in both junctional and compound nevi in this older age group. This pattern must be differentiated from dysplastic nevus and melanoma in-situ, which they may clinically resemble.

AB  - Abstract Mospd1 codes for a small protein with unknown physiological function, which is part of a family of genes, including Mospd2 and Mospd3, defined by the presence of the major sperm protein domain and two transmembrane domains. This work characterizes the Mospd1 gene, the intracellular location of the protein and its expression in different mouse tissues and mesenchymal cell lines during differentiation. The role of Mospd1 in mesenchymal cellular differentiation was studied by siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection experiments of the targeted cDNA show MOSPD1 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Removal of the last exon of the gene resulted in localization of the protein in the nucleus, which was attributed to a nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part. In mouse tissues the gene was generally strongly expressed while mesenchymal tissues showed the highest expression. In mesenchymal cell lines Mospd1 mRNA was higher expressed in cells with advanced differentiation status. In osteoblastic, myoblastic, and adipocytic cell lines Mospd1 was up-regulated during differentiation. Genome-wide gene expression analysis after knockdown of Mospd1 by siRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells revealed a shift in the gene expression pattern from mesenchymal to epithelial genes featuring up-regulation of the epithelial cadherin Cdh1 and down-regulation of its inhibitors Snail1 and 2 and the mesenchymal cadherin Cdh11, suggesting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. From these data we conclude that Mospd1 plays a pivotal role in the developmental regulation at the switch between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. J. Cell.

AB  - SUMMARY There is a much higher incidence of diabetic foot disease in those with concurrent renal disease and outcomes, including amputation and mortality, are generally poorer. The risk factors contributing to the higher incidence of foot disease in those with both diabetes and renal disease are outlined, and the evidence explored demonstrating higher incidence of foot disease across categories of renal disease, including impaired renal function (chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4), haemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation and simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation. Three major pathological aspects of diabetic foot disease in which concurrent renal disease either contributes to a higher incidence, or modifies the clinical manifestations and outcomes, are described: ulceration; Charcot neuroarthropathy and necrotic toes. Pathophysiology, clinical features and management strategies for these three conditions are described. Finally, the evidence for preventative strategies for foot disease is explored, and the important role of speed of access to specialist multi-disciplinary diabetic foot services discussed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction We describe and provide follow-up for a novel simplified technique permitting dual en bloc (DEB) transplantation of adult organs using single in situ arterial and venous anastomoses. Methods Twenty-two adult DEB transplants were performed at our center between 2001 and 2012, utilizing 44 kidneys en bloc. Results were compared with 20 solitary transplants from expanded criteria donors (ECD) associated with lower terminal serum creatinines and Remuzzi biopsy scores vs DEB group. Adult DEB implants had donor inferior vena cava connected to recipient external iliac vein and ?Y? arterial interposition graft anastomosed to the recipient iliac artery. Ureters were conjoined prior to implantation as a single patch into the recipient bladder. Results Mean operative time was 206±57 minutes in DEB vs 180±30 minutes in single transplants (P<.05). Delayed graft function rate was 23% vs 25% in both groups. At 12-month follow-up, mean serum creatinine was 152±66 ?mol/L vs in 154±52 ?mol/L DEB and single kidney transplant recipients, respectively (P=NS). Three-year overall and graft specific survival were 86% and 84% in the DEB group, respectively (P=NS). Complication rates were similar between groups. Conclusions This DEB renal transplantation technique is safe and effective in adults. By employing techniques used to conjoin organ vasculature ex vivo, the number of in situ anastomoses is reduced, thereby minimizing operative ischemic time and potential for complications associated with extensive vascular dissection.
