AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of applying chitosan membrane (ChiMe) on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (NS-RARP). The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data. Patients and Methods This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated. Results In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. Conclusion In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the ?standard? procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study. The present paper was performed before Conformité Européene (CE)-mark achievement.

AB  - Abstract Pulpal healing patterns were studied in a clinical material of 637 luxated and 95 root-fractured permanent incisors followed routinely for up to 11 years. It was found that pulpal healing patterns could generally be divided into 3 groups according to the degree of injury sustained by the pulp: little, moderate or severe. Thus after luxation injuries, pulp survival could be without radiographic change (PS), with pulp canal obliteration (PCO) or nonhealing (pulp necrosis (PN)). After root fracture, similar healing patterns could be observed: healing by hard tissue union of fragments (HT), by connective tissue union of fragments (CT) or by nonunion due to interposition of granulation tissue between fragments (GT) resulting from PN of the coronal fragment. In both trauma situations, healing or nonhealing could be determined by type of luxation injury, stage of root development and type of fixation used (forceful application of orthodontic bands vs. passively applied acid-etch fixation). Pulpal healing complications (PN or GT) were based on clinical findings (coronal discoloration, loss of pulpal sensibility) and radiographic findings (resorption processes of the lamina dura at the root apex or at the level of the root fracture). However, in both injury groups the same changes could also be seen to be intermediate steps in the pulpal healing process. Based on findings from these studies, hypotheses for the mechanics of pulpal healing are proposed as well as guidelines for acute and later treatment of dental luxations, root fractures and the diagnosis of healing complications.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe demographic factors, treatments, and outcomes associated with shoulder instability in dogs. Study Design Multi-center, retrospective cohort study. Animals Dog (n?=?130) with shoulder instability. Methods Medical records (October 2007?2010) from 4 hospitals of dogs with shoulder instability were reviewed to document age, breed, weight, and gender, categorize them into diagnosis cohorts of medial (MSI), lateral (LSI), or multidirectional (MDI) instability, determine treatments, and document outcomes. Treatment cohorts were defined as nonsurgical management, radiofrequency-induced thermal capsulorrhaphy (RITC), or shoulder reconstruction. Outcomes based upon clinician reevaluation and owner input >1 year after diagnosis were used to determine success, failure, and complication rates. Results Most dogs were diagnosed with MSI, but 23% had LSI or MDI. Dogs with MSI treated by reconstruction were more likely than dogs treated without surgery to have a successful outcome (odd's ratio?=?3.0; P?=?.01). Similarly, treatment of MDI with reconstruction was more likely to be associated with a successful outcome than nonsurgical management (odd's ratio?=?5.0; P?=?.007). Success with surgical and nonsurgical management was equivocal between LSI treatment cohorts, but the number of dogs with LSI was small. Complication rates for all treatment cohorts were <10%. Conclusions In dogs with shoulder instability, LSI and MDI are less common than MSI. Surgical reconstruction for treatment of MSI and MDI appears to produce a higher likelihood of achieving successful outcomes than nonsurgical management and surgical complication rates were low but these conclusions are tempered by the limitations of the study.

In all patients, in this retrospective anatomic study, the CT datasets were carefully evaluated for assessment of the bronchial tree morphology and branching pattern, of the arborization pattern of pulmonary arteries and veins and of the bronchoarterial?bronchovenous diameter ratios. Imaging anatomy was compared with previous published data based on dissection and microscopic anatomy. With the increasing availability of advanced imaging tools for wildlife animal patients, a detailed CT anatomy background is required to decipher correctly the pathologic respiratory conditions of sea turtles.

AB  - Learning disability and cerebral palsy are often related to factors present before birth. We report three patients (two with schizencephaly, one with unilateral cerebellar agenesis) in whom the timing of an insult to the foetus was known. In the first case, the mother had a trauma at 16 weeks of pregnancy and schizencephaly was discovered in the male infant associated with a left hemiplegia. In the second child, amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks into pregnancy may have been responsible for the same cortical anomaly. In the third case, sequential foetal echographies clearly demonstrated that an apparent unilateral cerebellar agenesis was related to an haemorrhagic event secondary to cerebellar trauma that occurred at 19 weeks of pregnancy. It is suggested that these brain malformations are related to an ischemic mechanism or a traumatic event in foetal life.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - ABSTRACT The main function of adipose tissue has been considered as storage of triglycerides. Adipose tissue was considered harmful for healing extensive and deep burns because of poor circulation and easy liquefaction in wound beds, which offer an excellent culture medium for bacteria. However, these traditional concepts have been challenged with the discovery of the endocrine function of adipose tissue. To investigate the effects of adipose tissue extract on wound healing, we created four 3.0 ? 2.5?cm full-thickness wounds on each side of the back of male Wu Zhi Shan minipigs (n=6), for eight wounds in each animal. The wounds were randomly divided to receive normal saline (0.5?mL; controls), adipose tissue extract (1.5?g), basic fibroblast growth factor (50?U/cm2), and epidermal growth factor (50?U/cm2). Reduction in wound area and wound volume was accelerated with adipose tissue treatment as compared with growth factor or control treatment. The thickness of the regenerated epidermis and the number of new vascular nets were markedly increased in adipose tissue-treated wounds. Biopsy of adipose tissue-treated wounds showed enhanced expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Factor VIII-related antigen, which indicated active cell differentiation and proliferation. In vitro study in rat tissue showed adipose tissue extracts stimulating skin growth. Bacteriology results showed no significant differences in amount or type of bacteria, whatever the treatment. These results may challenge the traditional concept that adipose tissue plays a negative role in wound healing and may offer direct evidence for encouraging the retention of adipose tissue in autologous skin grafting for skin wounds.

AB  - A 10-year-old, entire, male, mixed-breed dog was presented for severe haematuria and stranguria. Ultrasound revealed a large intraluminal urinary bladder blood clot and a prostatic space-occupying lesion. Invasion of the lesion into the prostatic urethra was detected ultrasonographically during compression of the urinary bladder. Post-mortem examination revealed primary prostatic haemangiosarcoma infiltrating the urethra. Haemangiosarcoma should be considered as a rare cause of prostatic mass lesions, haematuria or lower urinary tract signs in dogs.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of cefovecin (Convenia?; Pfizer Animal Health) in the treatment of urinary tract infections in cats. Method: A multi-centre, masked, randomised study was conducted in cats presenting with clinical signs indicative of urinary tract infections. Cephalexin (Rilexine?; Virbac) administered orally twice daily at 15 mg/kg bodyweight for 14 days was compared with a single subcutaneous injection of cefovecin in cats. The primary efficacy parameter assessed was bacterial elimination of the pretreatment uropathogen. Results: Four hundred and thirty-four cats were screened for urinary tract infections. One hundred and eighty-five cats were treated with either cefovecin (n=124) or cephalexin (n=61). Ninety-seven cats (22·2 per cent) had confirmed bacteriuria and 82 cats were included in efficacy analysis. Escherichia coli was eliminated in 76·7 per cent (23 of 30) of cefovecin-treated cats compared with 62·5 per cent (10 of 16) of cephalexin-treated cats. Cefovecin demonstrated statistical non-inferiority compared with cephalexin for bacterial elimination. There were no suspected adverse drug reactions attributable to treatment with cefovecin or cephalexin. Clinical Significance: Cefovecin was demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment for urinary tract infections.

AB  - Our aims are to review animal models of tauopathies, which include a number of brain disorders with various aetiologies, including ageing, genetics, infectious diseases, toxins, trauma and other unknown factors. Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of filaments of the microtubule-associated tau protein. The different aetiopathogeneses and distinct molecular events involved in tau aggregation have led to the development of various animal models for these diseases. In this review, rather than listing all current models, we focus on specific animal models addressing, among others, the question of tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregation and tau spreading. Physiological conditions, including normal ageing and hibernation, may exhibit tau phosphorylation and some aspects of tauopathies. However, most of the models of tauopathies involve genetically modified animals (mostly rodents, but also fruit fly, zebrafish and worm). Some of these models have been crucial for the development of therapeutic approaches in humans. The present review shows the difficulty in pinpointing a specific mechanism that may be targeted in tauopathies but also opens up new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Summary Paragangliomas (phaeochromocytomas) can present with life-threatening catecholamine-induced crises: hypertensive crisis; atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; hypotensive crisis; and multi-organ crisis. Crises may be triggered by administration of drugs, such as dopamine antagonists, or anaesthetic agents. Manipulation of the tumour is likely to trigger a crisis in a patient without sufficient alpha-adrenergic blockade and exclusion of catecholamine excess is necessary prior to surgery on any tumour located at a site typical for paragangliomas. Dedicated cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) of the adrenal glands should be undertaken to localize the tumour. Alpha blockade using phenoxybenzamine at an initial dose of 10mg 12-hourly PO should be initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed. This carries a risk of inducing profound hypotension and is best undertaken as an inpatient. Beta blockade to control tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia may safely be commenced once adequate alpha blockade is in place.

AB  - Steroid responsive meningitis-arteriitis (SRMA) is an immunemediated disorder commonly recognised in dogs in small animal practice. Two different forms of SRMA may occur. The typical, acute form of SRMA is characterised by cervical rigidity, pain, pyrexia and a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a less common, chronic form of SRMA, additional neurological deficits consistent with a spinal cord or a multi-focal neurological disorder may be present, often accompanied by a mononuclear CSF pleocytosis. The prognosis for young dogs in the acute stage of SRMA is relatively good with early and aggressive anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. In more protracted, relapsing cases of SRMA the prognosis is guarded, and therapy requires more aggressive, long term immunosuppression. The complete etiopathogenesis of SRMA is unknown; however, an aberrant immune response directed against the central nervous system (CNS) is most likely. Neutrophilic pleocytosis in SRMA seems to be facilitated by chemotactic factors in the CSF and upregulation of integrins and metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood brain barrier. Upregulation of IgA, induced by a Th2 immune response, also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of SRMA.

AB  - Background: Clinical studies of dental implants tend to fall into two broad categories. Efficacy studies apply strict exclusion criteria under carefully controlled conditions to produce a narrow range of results. Effectiveness studies more closely model real-world treatment environments, with a more diverse patient sample and broader range of provider skills. In this multi-center study of more than 2,900 dental implants, study centers were grouped by implant survival scores in an attempt to draw attention to the influence of confounding variables associated with the treatment environment. Methods: Thirty-two study centers were ranked by implant survival scores at uncovering and assigned to three performance groups. Centers whose overall scores were within approximately one standard deviation of the mean were placed in the middle (70%) performance group (MPG). The remaining centers were placed in either the top (15%) performance group (TPG) or the lower (15%) performance group (LPG). Overall survival and survival by phase of treatment were recorded for each of six implant designs in each of the three performance groups. Results: From implant placement to 36 months, the TPG achieved survival rates from 100% (for 3 designs) to 95.5% (for one design), with an average of 97% for all designs. Increased variations in survival (97.2% to 73%) occurred in the MPG, with larger variations (96.4% to 48%) in the LPG. The HA-coated cylinder recorded consistently high survival scores (over 95%) in all performance groups and all phases of treatment. Failures for other designs in the MPG and LPG were concentrated in the healing period (placement to uncovering), except for the commercially pure titanium screw, which had the most failures between uncovering and prosthesis loading. Conclusions: Implant design and treatment environment both play an important role in implant survival. Two design characteristics appear to enhance survival: 1) a surgical protocol involving minimal instrumentation at placement, and 2) hydroxyapatite (HA) coating. The HA-coated press-fit cylinder design was the least affected by the center's performance. Ann Periodontol 2000;5:129-136.

AB  - Abstract The involvement of vascular factors in Alzheimer dementia was first appreciated over 100 years ago. Recently, significant advances in our understanding of these brain-vascular relationships have taken place. Vascular cognitive impairment is now recognized as a distinct group of interrelated vascular-based neurological insults that can accumulate and lead to dementia. Importantly, the pathology of vascular cognitive impairment extends far beyond brain destruction wrought by major stroke. Other subtle changes may also arise that contribute to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, including subclinical stroke, white-matter changes such as hyperintensities and lipohyalinosis, small lacunar infarcts, cerebral hypoperfusion, and compromise of the blood-brain barrier. In this review we critically examine the emerging body of evidence that relates atherosclerotic risk factors, brain functioning, and Alzheimer disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the complications and outcome after total prostatectomy in dogs with histologically confirmed prostatic carcinoma. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals 25 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing total prostatectomy were reviewed from 2004 to 2016. Data retrieved included signalment, presenting signs, preoperative clinical findings, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging, surgical technique, histologic diagnosis, postoperative complications, occurrence of postoperative metastasis, and survival. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent total prostatectomy for prostatic carcinoma. Urinary anastomotic techniques included urethrourethral anastomosis in 14 dogs, cystourethral anastomosis in 9 dogs, ureterocolonic anastomosis in 1 dog, and anastomosis between the bladder neck and penile urethra in 1 dog. All dogs survived to discharge. Fifteen dogs were diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma, 8 dogs with prostatic adenocarcinoma, 1 with prostatic cystadenocarcinoma, and 1 with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Permanent postoperative urinary incontinence was present in 8 of 23 dogs. The median survival time was shorter in dogs with extracapsular tumor extension compared with those with intracapsular tumors. The overall median survival time was 231 days (range, 24-1255), with 1- and 2-year survival rates equal to 32% and 12%, respectively. Conclusion and Clinical Significance Total prostatectomy, combined with adjunct therapies, prolongs survival and lowers complication rates compared to previous reports of dogs with prostatic carcinoma. It should be noted, however, that case selection likely played a significant role in postoperative outcome.

AB  - Summary Death rules our lives. In this short paper, we summarize new insights into molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Here we review the most important processes of cell death: apoptosis and oncosis. We focus on autophagy, which is pivotal for neuronal homeostasis, in the context of neurodegeneration, infection and immunity. Its dysfunction has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Our understanding is still incomplete, but may highlight attractive new avenues for the development of treatment strategies to combat neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Summary In this pictorial essay, we showcase the imaging and pathological findings of a variety of giant breast lesions. Some lesions such as lipomas and hamartomas contain fibrous, glandular and lipomatous tissues and can have characteristic mammographic appearances. Other lesions (e.g. simple cysts, fibroepithelial lesions and some malignancies) may be mammographically indistinguishable and ultrasound (US) may be helpful in further characterisation, for example, by demonstrating posterior enhancement with simple cysts, cystic and solid components in papillary lesions, internal septations on haematomas and abscesses, solid homogeneity or heterogeneity in fibroepithelial lesions and increased vascularity in neoplastic, inflammatory or infective lesions. A diagnostic needle biopsy may be performed in some cases; however, with larger and heterogeneous lesions, there is an increased possibility of diagnostic inaccuracy due to limited sampling, such that full excision of the lesion may be advisable to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract The sex and gender identity disorders of the DSM are reviewed. The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining ?normal? sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.
