AB  - Everyone in the western world has a clear idea of what a hospital is. People think of a series of large multi-storeyed buildings filled with highly skilled and professional people (the ?ologists?) offering sophisticated services amid an impressive array of high technology equipment. Over the past century the development of the hospital has involved cramming more and more services, staff and resources into the one location. Many large hospitals today have a staff of several thousand and are like a small city. But will hospital development continue in this direction? We think not. We believe the hospital has reached an evolutionary branch. The fundamental nature of hospitals is about to change because of the application of information and clinical technology, changing medical practices and economic rationalism. To understand why requires an excursion into a number of disciplines including the history of the hospital, organisation behaviour, medical practice, management and health care policy. And this is no mere epistemological exploration: it is vital for society generally and those who work in health care particularly to understand that the existing structure of the principal organisation which delivers health care is coming to an end. Our principal focus is the teaching hospital, but the analysis applies to a substantial degree to the many kinds of hospitals found throughout the industrialised world.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the association between different subjective and objective assessments of ankle function in a population of athletes with or without functional ankle instability (FAI). 29 athletes with a history of ankle spraining were divided into two groups according to their ankle status: 16 with FAI (initial ankle sprain with residual functional instability) (age 24.6?±?3.1 years), and 13 COPERS (initial ankle sprain without residual instability) (age 25.3?±?4.4 years). The assessment of each individual's ankle function was based on three approaches: The ?functional-ankle-ability-measure? (FAAM) assessing subjective ankle functionality, measures of sensorimotor control as objective functional measurements and MRI-based T2-mapping as a quantitative marker of compositional joint status. Pearson's product-moment-correlation coefficient, student's t-test and analysis-of-variance were used for statistical analysis. Significant group differences existed for subjective ankle function (FAAM, p?=?0.04) and MRI-data mainly in the medial compartment of the ankle joint (p?≤?0.05). We found unique associations between T2-mapping results and sensorimotor scores in the COPER (r?=??0.756?0.849), and ?FAI?-group (r?=?0.630?0.657). The location and magnitude differed between groups. No correlations existed between these measures and the FAAM. This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential interrelations between various diagnostic measures of ankle function and structure in individuals with and without FAI. We found associations between MRI-results and selected measures of sensorimotor control, indicating a potential link between loss of ankle function and early joint degeneration. Despite these interrelations, each of the different assessment options appears to contain unique information on ankle functionality important in a clinical assessment. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate a distractable titanium cage for the treatment of disk-associated wobbler syndrome (DAWS). Study Design: Prospective study. Animals: Dogs (n=7) with DAWS. Methods: After total discectomy of C5?C6 and C6?C7, the median part of the vertebral body of C6 was removed with preservation of the lateral walls and dorsal cortex. The removed cancellous bone was collected. The implant was placed in the bony defect of C6. After placement, the titanium cage was distracted and affixed by 4 screws. Finally, the implant was filled and covered with cancellous bone. Dogs had follow-up examinations at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Six months after surgery, cervical radiographs and computed tomography (CT) were performed. Results: Although no intraoperative complications occurred, correct placement of the cage was technically challenging. Revision surgery was necessary in 2 dogs because of implant loosening and aggravation of vertebral tilting. All dogs improved after discharge from the hospital. In 1 dog, recurrence of clinical signs caused by articular facet proliferation at an adjacent intervertebral disk space occurred. Radiographs at 6 months demonstrated cage subsidence in 4 dogs. In all dogs, CT was suggestive for fusion of the bone graft with the vertebral body. Conclusions: Although results are promising, technical adaptations will be necessary to make this specific surgical technique, designed for humans, suitable for routine use in dogs.

AB  - ABSTRACT Hindfoot arthritis is an important contributor to foot pain and physical disability. While the subtalar joint (STJ) is most frequently affected, anatomical variants such as facet configuration were suggested to further STJ cartilage deterioration. T2* mapping enables detection of ultra-structural cartilage change, particularly in thin cartilage layers, but its feasibility in the STJ has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmentation consistency and inter-scan short-term precision error of T2* mapping of talocalcaneal cartilage and to investigate the relationship between facet configuration and STJ T2* values. Using 3Tesla morphological magnetic resonance imaging, STJ configuration was categorized according to the degree of fusion between anterior, medial, or posterior facets. Subsequently, two repeats of multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequences were performed to obtain T2* maps with repositioning. Segmentation consistency of T2* values attained an ICC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.69?0.99). Precision errors comprised a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging 0.01?0.05, corresponding to a root mean square CV of 0.03?0.04. A 2-joint configuration type (i.e., fused anterior-medial facets) was significantly associated with a decrease in posterior facet T2* values (??=??0.6, p?=?0.046). STJ T2* mapping is a reliable method requiring at least a 4% difference within people to enable detection of significant change. Anatomical variants in STJ configuration were associated with T2* values with the more stable 3-joint types exhibiting more favorable cartilage outcomes. Longer-term larger-scaled studies focusing on arthritis pathology are needed to further support the use of T2* mapping in hindfoot disease monitoring. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrastructure, and autopsy findings are reported for four Greyhounds with a myeloproliferative disorder. In all dogs abnormalities were found in the granulocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, resulting in granulocytic leukaemia, impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryocytic dysplasia. The presence in blood of many small platelet producing cells (micromegakaryocytes) led to initial diagnostic confusion in three dogs with two of them suspected of having lymphatic leukaemia. An approach to the diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, including the awareness of other clinical possibilities, is presented. The significance of the presence of micromegakaryocytes in the peripheral blood stream is discussed with reference to other veterinary reports and similar findings in man.

AB  - Abstract The sex and gender identity disorders of the DSM are reviewed. The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining ?normal? sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.

AB  - Abstract Research in humans and animals has shown that negative childhood experiences (NCE) can have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain. Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs.

AB  - Abstract The clinical translation of promising basic biomedical findings, whether derived from reductionist studies in academic laboratories or as the product of extensive high-throughput and high-content screens in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, has reached a period of stagnation in which ever higher research and development costs are yielding ever fewer new drugs. Systems biology and computational modeling have been touted as potential avenues by which to break through this logjam. However, few mechanistic computational approaches are used in a manner that is fully cognizant of the inherent clinical realities in which the drugs developed through this ostensibly rational process will be ultimately used. This article presents a translational systems biology approach to inflammation. This approach is based on the use of mechanistic computational modeling centered on inherent clinical applicability, namely that a unified suite of models can be applied to generate in silico clinical trials, individualized computational models as tools for personalized medicine, and rational drug and device design based on disease mechanism.

Bi-atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post-mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

AB  - Abstract This research assessed predictors of psychological well-being among 180 survivors of the Holocaust and among a comparison group of 160 immigrants of similar sociocultural background living in Israel. Four variables: better health, higher instrumental coping, lower emotional coping, and lesser social concern, were found to be significant predictors of psychological well-being in both groups. Among survivors, these four variables, as well as being married, fewer life crises, communication with co-workers, and not being resigned to fate, accounted for 52% of explained variance in psychological well-being. Among immigrants who served as a comparison group, these four variables, along with a relaxed personality style and good communication with one's spouse, accounted for 36% or explained variance in psychological well-being. Theses factors underscore the importance of current social and psychological adaptation for psychological well-being among survivors and among older persons of similar backgrounds who did not endure the extreme trauma of the Holocaust.

AB  - Abstract Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas. Its etiology remains obscure. A plausible hypothesis suggests that a complex interplay of host factors, infectious processes, and non-infectious environmental factors, matched with a susceptible genetic background, results in a pathway that leads to systemic granulomatous inflammation. Although presentations of sarcoidosis vary enormously, multi-organ involvement is a common feature. Cutaneous involvement occurs in about 25% of patients with protean manifestations and variable prognoses. Skin manifestations are divided into specific lesions with histopathologically evident non-caseating granulomas and nonspecific lesions arising from a reactive process that does not form granulomas. A peculiar form of cutaneous sarcoidosis is represented by sarcoidal lesions at sites of trauma that has caused scarring. The pathogenesis of scar sarcoidosis remains unknown. Scar sarcoidosis is also associated with herpes zoster infection, surgery, and tattooing. Such heterogeneous events, along with those at the sites of chronic lymphedema, thermal burns, radiation dermatitis, and vaccinations, occur on areas of vulnerable skin labeled ?immunocompromised districts?. Numerous options are available for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Although corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for initial systemic therapy, other nonsteroidal agents have proven effective and therefore useful for long-term management. Tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists such as infliximab may have a role in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, especially in refractory cases that are resistant to standard regimens. Elucidation of the relationship of sarcoidal granulomas with malignancy and immunity may facilitate a better understanding of some pathomechanisms operating in neoplastic and immunity-related disorders.

AB  - Purpose As deep neural networks achieve more success in the wide field of computer vision, greater emphasis is being placed on the generalizations of these models for production deployment. With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security measures and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity. Methods In this paper, we implement cyclic weight transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multisite learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions. Results The MSL model attains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0.914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0.646 and average correlation of 0.871. Conclusions We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.

AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.

AB  - Abstract As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) becomes more readily available and more frequently utilized in the assessment of canine carpal lameness, both normal variations and early pathologic conditions must be recognized to optimize patient care and provide accurate diagnosis. On cross sectional studies of the canine carpus, cyst-like lesions have been detected at the dorsolateral aspect of the intermedioradial carpal bone. The cross-sectional imaging and histologic properties of these lesions have not been described. The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the MRI and histologic features of these cyst-like lesions in a cohort of clinically sound dogs. It was hypothesized that the lesions would show features similar to intraosseous ganglion cysts of the human wrist. Twenty-five cadaveric canine carpi were obtained and a total of 13 lesions were detected on MRI. Based on MRI, six carpi with lesions of varying size and one normal carpus were submitted for histological evaluation. Five of the abnormal carpi had nonarticular cyst-like lesions; one specimen with a positive magnetic resonance image for a cyst-like lesion had no cyst-like lesion on histology. Conspicuity of a medium-size lesion as evaluated on radiographs was poor. Given the presence of these nonarticular cyst-like lesions in a population of clinically sound patients, their clinical importance is uncertain. The development of these lesions may relate to altered mechanics or genetic predispositions, requiring additional study.

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - SUMMARY Conventional radiography of the temporal bone has not kept pace with the progress of modern otology and for this reason many Otologists have felt that radiography of the temporal bone is of little value in chronic suppurative otitis media. The diagnosis may be made entirely on clinical grounds and many surgeons feel that with experience and careful techniques the extent and nature of the pathology can be determined during the course of surgical exploration without prior information being required. However, multi-directional tomography of high quality, carried out by qualified, trained technicians and reported on by a Radiologist who has detailed knowledge of the cross sectional anatomy of the temporal bone and the needs of the Otologic surgeon can provide information of great value. Information concerning the size and extent of the lesion that will be encountered at surgery, the presence of erosion of intra-temporal structures which may increase the risk of surgery, the presence of discontinuity or disease of the ossicular chain and the presence of anatomical variations which may influence the surgical approach can be obtained pre-operatively only by tomographic study. If this is recognized by both the Radiologist and Otologist and a team relationship is established, the patient will benefit from the tremendous advances which have been made in the development of radiological equipment and techniques.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare yet potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity via autoantibody formation has been associated with idiopathic TTP; however, specific triggers are poorly defined. Previous studies have reported seasonal associations of TTP, with warm-weather seasons appearing to have the strongest predilection. We characterized the seasonal distribution of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP at our multi-hospital institution. Methods: Apheresis records from 2005?2012 were queried for patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP, accompanying pre-plasmapheresis ADAMTS13 activity <10%, and no other explanations for thrombotic microangiopathy. Date of admission and ADAMTS13 activity were collected. Both initial episodes and relapses in patients whose initial episodes occurred since 2005 were included in the analysis. Goodness-of-fit chi-square analysis was performed and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: Of 237 consecutive new patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of TTP, 73 patients met inclusion criteria and had a total of 110 unique presentations for either initial TTP episodes or TTP relapses. Sixteen patients had 37 relapses of their idiopathic TTP (range 1?7). No statistically significant seasonal or monthly associations were identified with either initial or any TTP episodes. Conclusion: A seasonal association of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP was not observed. Unknown variables may explain previous observations of seasonal associations of idiopathic TTP in other regions of the United States. Thus, individual institutions should characterize their own seasonal distributions of idiopathic TTP as part of the exploration of possible disease triggers in their respective areas. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract The aims of the present study were to clarify the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the aging brain, and to relate the MRI findings to higher order cortical function. A total of 118 healthy aged volunteers (41 men, 77 women) underwent cranial MRI electroencephalography (EEG), Benton visual retention test (BVRT) and interview. The subjects had no past history or clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disorder, head trauma or dementia and were living at home without any difficulty. The majority of the subjects have participated in this series of studies since 1982. Using a 1.5 T superconductive MR instrument, T1-weighted, proton density and T2-weighted images were obtained. The MRI data were rated visually by regarding 12 items according to fixed criteria. T2 high signal intensity (T2HSI) lesions were found in 69.5% of subjects, the prevalence of which increased with age. T2HSI lesions were most frequently found in the basal ganglia (61.9%), followed by the thalamus (39.0%), parietal lobe (37.0%), temporal lobe (12.7%) and pons (8.5%). Among these lesions, lacunar infarction showed low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and was found in 24.6% of subjects, the prevalence also increasing with age. These findings, including brain atrophy determined according to similar criteria, were correlated closely with the subjects' age. The results of BVRT showed a close relation with T2HSI, suggesting that T2HSI may influence cognitive function. When the subjects were classified according to the presence of T2HSI, lacunar infarction and EEG abnormalities, brain atrophy was significantly milder in a group of subjects with T2HSI(-), lacunar infarction(-) and normal EEG than in the other groups. This suggests that changes seemingly representing physiological aging may be promoted by another pathological which also exerts influences on higher order cerebral function.
