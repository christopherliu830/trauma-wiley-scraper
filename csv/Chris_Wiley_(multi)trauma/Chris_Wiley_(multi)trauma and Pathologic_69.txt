AB  - ABSTRACT A six-week-old female borzoi puppy from a brother-sister mating developed a generalised illness characterised by anorexia, temporary intention tremor, episodic pyrexia, tachypnoea, conjunctivitis, otitis and neck pain. Haematological abnormalities included an inflammatory leukogram and regenerative anaemia. Blood cultures remained sterile; clinical chemistry values were unremarkable. The puppy had recurrent seizures and was euthanased when 18 weeks old. Post mortem examination revealed a multisystemic inflammatory disease involving thyroids, lymph nodes, spleen, pancreas, bladder and lung, but no lesions to account for the neurological signs. The cause of this generalised disease was not recognised. The histological features are unusual and resemble those described in other dogs of this breed.

AB  - A four-year-old, entire male domestic cat was referred for assessment of a large abdominal mass of three-weeks duration. Diagnostic imaging suggested the presence of either splenic neoplasia, an abdominal abscess or haematoma. A coeliotomy was performed and an enlarged, irregular mass, including the left kidney and adrenal gland, was identified. The mass was removed, requiring a left adrenalo-uretero-nephrectomy. The aorta was accidentally punctured during the procedure, resulting in paraplegia. Given a poor prognosis, the owners decided to have the cat euthanased. Histological examination of the mass was characteristic of a chronic expanding haematoma.

AB  - Abstract Screening mammography can detect early, nonpalpable breast cancer, resulting in improved long-term survival and cure rates. However, greater compliance with screening guidelines has increased the number of mammographic abnormalities found. Since 75% of the surgical biopsies performed for nonpalpable lesions are benign, less expensive and invasive methods of diagnosis are evolving to reduce the cost of screening mammography programs and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign mammographic findings. Stereotactic needle core biopsy allows minimally invasive sampling of most breast lesions and generates tissue cores for histologic evaluation. A specific pathologic diagnosis, as well as determination of invasiveness, can be achieved for mass lesions. Microcalcification can also be sampled to diagnose in situ cancer, although the use of core biopsy for noncomedo intraductal cancer is still evolving. The procedure demands meticulous technique to assure accurate needle placement, and careful correlation of biopsy results and patient follow-up is mandatory. Accuracy relative to surgical biopsy of nonpalpable lesions has been excellent in published series. The role of this procedure in patients with low, intermediate, and high suspicion mammographic lesions is discussed. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Intra-abdominal cryptococcosis was diagnosed in two young dogs. The first, an entire male border collie, was presented with vomiting. An abdominal mass detected during physical examination proved to be cryptococcal mesenteric lymphadenitis on exploratory laparotomy. The second dog, a female neutered giant schnauzer, was presented with neurological signs suggestive of encephalopathy. Intestinal cryptococcal granulomas were detected in an extensive diagnostic investigation which included abdominal ultrasonography. The gastrointestinal tract was considered the most likely portal of entry for cryptococcal organisms in both cases. Both dogs were treated using surgery and multiagent antifungal chemotherapy. The first case succumbed despite therapy, while the second dog was treated successfully as gauged by return to clinical normality and a substantial decline in the cryptococcal antigen titre which continued to fall after cessation of treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the frequency, types, and risk factors for acute perioperative adverse events (AEs) in dogs that had ventral slot decompression (VSD) for cervical intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Design Retrospective, case?control study. Animals Dogs (n?=?546) with cervical IVDD treated by VSD; 54 cases experiencing AE and 492 controls. Methods Historical, clinical, diagnostic, operative, and outcome data were collected. AE were graded using a Spine Adverse Events Severity (SAVES) system. Associations between the development of AE and hypothesized risk factors were analyzed using bi- and multi-variable analyses. Results AE were observed in 54 dogs (9.9%). Minor AE (SAVES Grade 1?2) occurred in 3.5% (19 dogs) and major (SAVES Grades 3?5) AE in 6.4% (35 dogs). Deterioration in neurologic status (n?=?13), persistent pain (12), and intraoperative hemorrhage (7) were common major AE. NSAID administration, surgeon experience, C7?T1 disc location, and intraoperative hypotension were significantly associated with AE in multivariate analyses. Improvement of AE occurred in 48/54 (88.9%) of cases, although reoperative neurosurgery was required in 48.5% (17/35) of dogs experiencing major AE. Dogs with major AE had significantly longer hospitalization and worse outcomes than dogs with minor AE or controls. No fatal AE occurred, although 0.7% (4/546) of dogs were euthanatized postoperatively. Conclusions AE occurred in 9.9% of dogs that had VSD, and were significantly associated with perioperative hypotension, C7?T1 disc extrusions, surgeon experience, and NSAID usage. Identification of a major postoperative AE is an indication for immediate diagnostic imaging studies, as 50% of dogs experiencing major AE required reoperation.

AB  - Summary Melanocytic tumors of the oral cavity, melanoma and melanocytoma, are frequently diagnosed in the dog and are diagnosed far less often in other species. Melanomas invade soft tissues and bone and may be associated with extensive local tissue destruction. Although fibrous tissue-based lesions can share substantial histological overlap, these lesions can vary in their biological behavior and long-term prognosis. The canine biologically high-grade/histologically low-grade fibrosarcoma (H/L FSA) is an interesting and problematic mesenchymal lesion, first reported in 1994 by Ciekot et al. The chapter discusses the neoplastic entities fibroma and FSA. Some equine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lesions are so poorly differentiated, it is difficult to determine if they have an epithelial or mesenchymal histogenesis. As for dogs, investigations have rarely identified papillomavirus DNA sequences in feline OSCC lesions. Although lymphoma occurs in many different veterinary species, oral lymphoma most often occurs in dogs and cats and less often in horses, cattle, and goats.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Successful treatment and prevention of kidney disease in dogs requires a multi-dimensional approach to identify and eliminate causes or exacerbating factors, provide professional evaluation on a regular basis and implement a comprehensive treatment programme when necessary. Over the years, many therapeutic and preventive interventions have been developed or advocated for chronic kidney disease in dogs, but evidence of efficacy or effectiveness is often lacking or highly variable. Accordingly, the main objective of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence supporting various aspects of managing canine chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer treatment. As important intracellular factors, aberrant tumor transmembrane signal transduction pathways, which include the prosurvival cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT) and the proapoptosis pathways (Wnt, p53 and TNF-α/NF-?B), have been proved to be crucial determinants of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in malignant lesions. There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation sensitization. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting aberrant tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of ionizing radiation. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the aberrant signal pathways, and the potential druggable targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the aberrant signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also addressed.

AB  - Summary Furcation defects present the greatest challenges to the success of periodontal therapy, as a reduced efficacy of periodontal therapy and higher risk of tooth loss have been consistently observed in multi-rooted teeth with furcation involvement, regardless of the treatment modality employed. An accurate and precise pre-surgical diagnosis is essential in order to approach correctly patients affected by periodontal disease complicated by the invasion of molar furcation areas. Root amputation can usually be indicated in the maxillary molars for removing the distal root, thus avoiding the need to restore the tooth with a crown in a conservative treatment plan. Treatment options for molars with furcation involvement could be divided into three different modalities: conservative procedures, regenerative procedures, and resective procedures. Resective techniques have been developed especially for deep class II and class III furcation-involved molars to overcome the anatomical limitations by physically removing both the dental and osseous structures that make up the defect.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

AB  - ABSTRACT A retrospective study of 27 dogs with deep mycoses was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of initial laboratory results in determining a diagnosis. Fifteen cases of disseminated blastomycosis, five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis and seven cases of gastrointestinal phycomycosis were studied. Haematologic results consistent with a chronic inflammatory disease (mild to moderate anaemia and moderate to marked monocytosis) were common findings in blastomycosis and phycomycosis. Cases of histoplasmosis were characterized by a more severe anaemia with a neutrophilia and left shift. The severe anaemia present in three out of five (3/5) dogs with histoplasmosis was apparently due to myelophthisis and intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation. Coagulation function tests and/or the haemograms suggested the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis in four dogs with histoplasmosis. Clinical chemistry results in blastomycosis and phycomycosis were usually unremarkable. Hepatic lesions in histoplasmosis were suggested by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and decreases in serum albumin. Cytology was frequently diagnostic for blastomycosis (11/13 cases) and histoplasmosis (3/4 cases) but was inconsistent in phycomycosis (1/3 cases).

Clinical examination, medical and dental history examination was performed in 100 leprosy patients. Results:? The results revealed that 71 patients, 50 men and 21 women, exibited oral lesions. The most frequent lesions were: fissured tongue (18 cases), inflammatory papillary hyperplasia (16 cases), chronic atrophic candidiasis (10 cases), fibroma (10 cases), erythematous candidiasis (eight cases), and traumatic ulceration (seven cases). Conclusion:? We conclude that leprosy-related lesions are not present in patients undergoing treatment for leprosy, probably due to response to multidrug therapy.

AB  - Summary Photography should be regarded as an integral part of daily clinical practice, and photographic equipment as part of the dental armamentarium, no different to a dental handpiece. However, the common consensus is that a camera is an extraneous apparatus, exclusively reserved for specialists, or clinicians with a penchant for taking pictures. The technical requirements of a lens for dental photography is that it serves a dual-purpose, first for portraiture and second for close-up or macrophotography. Many cameras have built-in flashes that pop-up when the lighting conditions are less than optimal. This is satisfactory for general photography but ill-advised for macrophotography. Some relatively inexpensive items are also useful for completing the photographic equipment arsenal. These include rechargeable batteries, a multi-card reader for transferring images to a computer, UV bulbs for visualising fluorescence of natural teeth and artificial prostheses, or porosity defects in porcelain restorations.

This complex process requires an organized approach and a thorough understanding of ventilator management and ECMO physiology. The purpose of this article is to describe the venovenous ECMO weaning protocol used at our institution as well as provide a review of the literature.

AB  - Objectives: The efficacy of maropitant (Cerenia?; Pfizer Inc.) as an anti-emetic for use in dogs with ongoing emesis was evaluated in a two-phase multi-centric study conducted at veterinary clinics in France, Italy, Slovakia and the UK. Methods: In phase I, dogs with ongoing emesis were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either maropitant (32 dogs) or metoclopramide (34 dogs). In phase II, dogs were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to maropitant (77 dogs) or metoclopramide (40 dogs). Maropitant was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg/day for up to five days. Metoclopramide was administered as recommended on the product labels as licensed at 0·5 to 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously or orally with the daily dose divided over two to three administrations per day for up to three to five days. Results: In phase I, 97 per cent of dogs treated with maropitant and 71 per cent of dogs treated with metoclopramide did not vomit after treatment (P<0·01). The mean number of emetic events after maropitant treatment was significantly reduced compared with that after metoclopramide treatment (P=0·01). In phase II, the occurrence of emesis was lower for maropitant during the first 24 hours (P<0·0001) and for each day thereafter. Clinical Significance: A single daily dose of maropitant was more effective than metoclopramide administered two or three times daily in the treatment of emesis caused by various aetiologies in dogs.

AB  - We present a case of a male infant born to a 21 year-old mother without significant past medical history. Clinically, he presented with diffuse bullae and thickened patches of yellow to brown skin exhibiting Darier?s Sign. This condition affected the infant?s entire integument. There was also mild hepatosplenomegaly, detected radiologically. Blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy were normal. The differential diagnosis, clinically, included diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, bullous genodermatosis, epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, incontinentia pigmenti, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Histologically, there was a proliferation of mast cells within the papillary and reticular dermis, which exhibited positivity with Leder staining, thereby confirming the diagnosis of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Mastocytosis is a condition characterized by mast cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Diffuse cutaneous matocytosis is a rare subset limited to the skin. It occurs in about two percent of cases of mastocytosis and usually affects children before the age of three. This case, although extremely rare, gives an excellent overview of the differential diagnosis of bullous lesions in the pediatric population.

AB  - A nine-month-old Labrador retriever was referred to the Clinica Veterinaria Privata San Marco because of frequent headshaking and downward turning of the right ear. Clinical examination revealed that there was no external acoustic meatus in the right ear. Computed tomography confirmed that the vertical part of the right auditory canal ended blindly, providing a diagnosis of external auditory canal atresia. Cytological examination and culture of fluid from the canal and the bulla revealed only aseptic cerumen; for this reason, it was assumed that the dog was probably affected by a congenital developmental deformity of the external auditory canal. Reconstructive surgery was performed using a ?pull-through? technique. Four months after surgery the cosmetic and functional results were satisfactory.
