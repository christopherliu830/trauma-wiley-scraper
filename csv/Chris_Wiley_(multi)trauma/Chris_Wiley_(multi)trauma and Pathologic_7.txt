AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the experience of three highly specialized centres in the vascular evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) in teenagers, as there is little information on this topic, and although clinical guidelines support the use of vascular studies in selected cases, our experience is that vascular evaluation aimed at diagnosing organic ED is uncommon in teenagers, and most are designated as having psychogenic ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a retrospective multi-institutional analysis of three ED databases (1998?2003) we assessed males aged ≤19?years presenting with ED. The review of these databases focused on demographic characteristics, risk factors for ED, erectile function, results of vascular evaluation, and the causes of ED. RESULTS In all, 40 males aged 14?19?years were identified. The mean (range) duration of ED at presentation was 22.6?(4?84)?months. The major risk factors for ED were antecedent perineal trauma (37%) and penile trauma or surgery (15%). The mean (sd) International Index of Erectile Function ?erectile function? domain score was 15?(4). Information obtained by history taking was not predictive of the cause of ED. Vascular studies were performed in 62% of the patients and 48% of these patients were found to have an underlying vascular pathology; 42% of the latter group were found to be possible candidates for surgical intervention and another 16% needed further angiographic evaluation. CONCLUSION ED in teenagers should not be routinely categorized as psychogenic without an adequate vascular evaluation, as a significant percentage have abnormal erectile haemodynamics consistent with vasculogenic ED.

AB  - Abstract Our contribution to this special issue focuses on the phenomenon of intrusive trauma memory. While intrusive trauma memories can undoubtedly cause impairment, we argue that they may exist for a potentially adaptive reason. Theory and experimental research on intrusion development are reviewed and possible functions of intrusive trauma memory are explored. These functions include aiding emotional processing, preventing future harm and protecting the coherence of the self. The issue of intrusive images in other disorders than posttraumatic stress disorder is briefly addressed. This review suggests that the study of function is important for a nuanced view on the modulation of intrusive trauma memory in both experimental psychopathology and clinical treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? To summarize and discuss findings from genetic studies conducted on pathological gambling (PG). Methods? Searches were conducted on PubMed and PsychInfo databases using the keywords: ?gambling and genes?, ?gambling and family? and ?gambling and genetics?, yielding 18 original research articles investigating the genetics of PG. Results? Twin studies using the Vietnam Era Twin Registry have found that: (i) the heritability of PG is estimated to be 50?60%; (ii) PG and subclinical PG are a continuum of the same disorder; (iii) PG shares genetic vulnerability factors with antisocial behaviours, alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder; (iv) genetic factors underlie the association between exposure to traumatic life-events and PG. Molecular genetic investigations on PG are at an early stage and published studies have reported associations with genes involved in the brain's reward and impulse control systems. Conclusions? Despite the paucity of studies in this area, published studies have provided considerable evidence of the influence of genetic factors on PG and its complex interaction with other psychiatric disorders and environmental factors. The next step would be to investigate the association and interaction of these variables in larger molecular genetic studies with subphenotypes that underlie PG. Results from family and genetic investigations corroborate further the importance of understanding the biological underpinnings of PG in the development of more specific treatment and prevention strategies.

AB  - Abstract Background Pathological fracture is an uncommon presentation in patients with long bone osteosarcoma. Procedures We retrospectively reviewed the database of all patients with histologically proven osteosarcoma under the age of 18 years from 1991 to 2011 in a tertiary pediatric oncology referral center. Five patients with pathological fractures as the first presentation of osteosarcoma were identified. The treatment strategies and complications were evaluated. Ten sex-, age-, and site- matched osteosarcoma patients without pathological fracture were selected as controls. The incidence of distant metastases and outcome, including local recurrence and survival, were compared between the index (with pathological fracture) and the control (without pathological fracture) groups. Results In the index group, all five patients were boys and the mean age of onset was 13.1 years (range 9.2?14.9). Three patients (60%, 3/5) received amputation and two (40%) had wide local excision of the tumor. Pathological fracture group showed higher rate of lung (60% vs. 10%, P?=?0.04) and bone (60% vs. 10%, P?=?0.04) metastases at presentation, and shorter overall 5-year survival (P?=?0.04) than the control group. There was no significant difference of local recurrence (20%, P?=?1.00) between these two groups regardless of the type of operation. Conclusion Osteosarcoma complicated by pathological fracture as first presentation had higher incidence of lung and bone metastases at presentation and worse survival rate when compared with patients without pathological fracture.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Background This study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound combined with vaginal and endometrial cytology in detecting endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women. Method In all patients who underwent dilatation and curettage (D & C) for postmenopausal bleeding during four years endometrial thickness, vaginal and endometrial cytology were evaluated. Results Accuracy of endometrial thickness in detecting pathologic condition, like as polyp, hyperplasia and carcinoma was high sensitive but with low specificity. Combined use transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology show very high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer. The combined use of three diagnostic methods show no benefit for other pathologic conditions. Conclusion Combination of transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology can not absolutely replace histologic findings obtained by D & C. However, in the cases with thin endometrium and negative cytology D & C could be avoided. Usefulness of these three methods has to be found in providing more information resulting in better understanding of endometrial condition.

AB  - Abstract Many US veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq have multiple physical and psychiatric problems. A major focus of research has been on determining the effects of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), but mTBI is rarely diagnosed in the absence of co-occurring conditions such as blast exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, etc. These potentially interactive psychological and physical conditions produce complex patterns of cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms that impede civilian reintegration and complicate efficient and effective treatment planning. The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) has developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of deployment trauma and its consequences in veterans of these wars. The prospective TRACTS longitudinal cohort study conducts state-of-the-art assessments in the domains of biomedical function, lifetime head trauma, psychological function encompassing deployment experience and lifetime exposure to traumatic events, neuropsychological function, and structural and functional neuroimaging. The TRACTS longitudinal cohort study is the first of its kind to comprehensively evaluate lifetime incidence of TBI and PTSD in these veterans, in addition to those incurred during military deployment. The protocol has begun to reveal information that will help improve understanding of the complex pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress disorders.

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.

AB  - Abstract Aims To develop a comprehensive etiological model of pathological gambling (PG) for men and women based on Kendler's development model for major depression, which groups 22 risk factors into five developmental tiers (childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, adulthood, last year). We hypothesized that: (1) all risk factors would be associated significantly with PG; (2) the effect of risk factors in earlier developmental tiers would be accounted for by later tiers; and (3) there would be few gender differences. Design Separate models were built for life-time gambling and for 12-month PG among those with life-time gambling. Setting Data drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) in the United States. Participants Respondents to NESARC wave 1 (n?=?43?093). Measurements Odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) were used to determine the risk factors in multiple models. Findings After mutually adjusting for other risk factors, family history of substance use disorders (SUD) or depression, impulsivity, childhood-onset anxiety, number of Axis I and II disorders, history of SUD, nicotine dependence, social deviance in adulthood, and past-year history of SUD, nicotine dependence and independent stressful life events predicted life-time gambling. Past history of PG, number of personality disorders and past year nicotine dependence were associated significantly with 12-month PG (all P?<?0.05). There were no significant gender interactions for 12-month PG. Conclusions A modification of Kendler's model for major depression provides a foundation for the development of a comprehensive developmental model of pathological gambling. Life-time history of gambling and 12-month pathological gambling appear to be determined by risk factors in several developmental levels, with the effect of earlier development tiers accounted for by later ones.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the clinical dogma that very high doses of methylprednisolone helpful in spinal cord injury are also helpful in optic nerve trauma. Methods: The right optic nerve of 29 male rats received a 5 second traumatic crush followed 30 minutes later by one of five intravenous treatments (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, or saline). Treatment was continued for three additional administrations at 6 hour intervals. Untreated sham controls (n = 7) were also prepared. Six weeks after injury, animals were sacrificed, perfused and optic nerves systematically counted. RESULTS: Axon counts (means +/? s.e.m.) were as follows: Saline = 16,670 +/? 8,900 (n = 5); Methylprednisolone: 30 mg/kg = 8,098 +/? 4,741 (n = 5); 60 mg/kg = 6,925 +/? 6,517 (n = 4); 90 mg/kg = 2,663 +/? 2,653 (n = 4); 120 mg/kg = 6,149 +/? 3,487 (n = 6). Consequently, the data revealed that saline treated animals retained more axons than those that were administered methylprednisolone (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that methylprednisolone exacerbates axonal loss following crush injury in the rat optic nerve. Based on the results of this study, clinical studies of traumatic optic neuropathy in the future should also examine the possibility that corticosteroid treatment may have an adverse effect on visual outcome following optic nerve trauma.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing gender-based violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV. I conducted a content analysis of 17 publications that use PVAR to address GBV to assess for how the PVAR projects also treat trauma symptoms. Briere and Scott's (2015) philosophical approach to trauma therapy is the conceptual framework for data analysis. I developed a priori codes aligned with the philosophical approach and deductively applied them to the data: (a) intrinsic processing; (b) respect, positive regard, and compassion; (c) hope; and (d) the pain paradox. The results reveal how data from the 17 PVAR studies correspond with the 4 philosophical concepts. Practical and research recommendations include using and evaluating PVAR as a tool to treat trauma and contribute to trauma treatment research with underrepresented communities.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Summary Brucella-exposure and infection is increasingly recognized in marine mammals worldwide. To better understand the epidemiology and health impacts of Brucella spp. in marine mammals of Brazil, molecular (conventional PCR and/or real-time PCR), serological (Rose Bengal Test [RBT], Competitive [c]ELISA, Serum Agglutination Test [SAT]), pathological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or microbiological investigations were conducted in samples of 129 stranded or by-caught marine mammals (orders Cetartiodactyla [n = 124], Carnivora [n = 4] and Sirenia [n = 1]). Previous serological tests performed on available sera of 27 of the 129 animals (26 cetaceans and one manatee), indicated 10 seropositive cetaceans. Conventional PCR and/or real-time PCR performed in cases with available organs (n = 119) and/or blood or swabs (n = 10) revealed 4/129 (3.1%) Brucella-infected cetaceans (one of them with positive serology; the remaining three with no available sera). Pathological, IHC and/or microbiological analyses conducted in PCR/real-time PCR and/or seropositive cases (n = 13) revealed Brucella-type lesions, including meningitis/meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, necrotizing hepatitis, pericarditis and osteoarthritis in some of those animals, and positive IHC was found in all of them (excepting two live-stranded animals without available organs). Brucella spp. culture attempts were unsuccessful. Our results demonstrated exposure, asymptomatic, acute and chronic Brucella sp. infection in several cetacean species in the Brazilian coast, highlighting the role of this pathogen in stranding and/or death, particularly in Clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) and short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) off Ceará State. Novel hosts susceptible to Brucella included the franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). Additionally, three coinfection cases involving Brucella spp. and cetacean morbillivirus, Edwarsiella tarda and Proteus mirabilis were detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term and large-scale survey of Brucella spp. in marine mammals of South America, widening the spectrum of susceptible hosts and geographical distribution range of this agent with zoonotic potential.
