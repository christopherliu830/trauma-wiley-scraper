AB  - A 17 year-old boy with a history of Alagille syndrome presented with three-months duration of spontaneous eruption of multple non-pruritic, non-painful papules on the extremities. He also reported seeing ?dark spots? at night. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced and appeared smaller than his age. The skin examination revealed numerous 2?8?mm follicular, keratotic papules on the extensor surfaces of the patient?s arms and legs. H&E preparation of the skin biopsy revealed distention of the upper portion of the follicles with prominent keratotic plugging, as well as focal follicular perforation and acute inflammation. Laboratory examination revealed a vitamin A level of 11, carotene level of less than 2, and retinol binding protein of 2.1. The patient was diagnosed with phrynoderma and initiated on vitamin A therapy. After a two-months course of vitamin A therapy, his serum vitamin A increased to 67, and he had dramatic improvement of the follicular eruption. This is a fascinating case of phrynoderma in a child with biliary dysfunction. The presence of perforating folliculitis on histology is curious, as there are less than 10 documented cases of perforating folliculitis in phrynoderma. This case illustrates the intriguing clinical and pathological presentations of phrynoderma.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Summary The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and fetal losses. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), particularly against the phospholipid binding protein beta-2 glycoprotein I (?2GPI), play an important role in APS pathological mechanisms. aPL can activate intracellular signal transduction in a ?2GPI-dependent manner to induce inflammatory responses, and promote hypercoagulable state and recurrent spontaneous abortion when ?2GPI is associated with the cell surface receptor. In vivo and in vitro studies show that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is the high affinity receptor that connects ?2GPI to the target cells. However, ANXA2 is not a transmembrane protein and lacks an intracellular signal transduction pathway. Growing evidences suggest that the transmembrane protein toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) might act as an ?adaptor? for intracellular signal transduction. This review focuses on the role of TLR4 and its signalling pathway in APS pathological mechanisms which will help us better understand the pathological processes of this syndrome.

AB  - Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) constitute 5?10% of all cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and are usually considered mimics of melanocytic proliferations rather than fibrous lesions. We report two cases of pigmented fibrous proliferations that demonstrate features of both dermatofibromas and DFSP. The first case is a 19-year-old man with a three year history of a slowly growing pigmented lesion on the right arm. On clinical exam the lesion was a 7?mm firm pigmented papulonodular lesion. The second case is a 31-year-old woman with a 4?5 year history of a slowly enlarging, asymptomatic ?dark area? on the right buttock. On clinical exam the lesion is a 2?cm darkly pigmented flat nodule. Morphologically both lesions are primarily dermal proliferations of spindled cells admixed with pigmented dendritic melanocytes. The lesional cells trap collagen fibers at the periphery and there is basal cell hyperpigmentation. Adnexal structures are effaced but significant trapping of subcutaneous fat is not present. By immunohistochemistry both lesions show focal CD34 positivity but are negative for Factor XIIIa and melanocytic markers. Although overlap between dermatofibromas and DFSP is well documented in the literature, pigmented fibrous lesions with features of both entities are not well described.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: A 70% increase in graduating interns is projected in Australia from 2007 to 2012. Emergency medicine is a key term in the intern year. There is little information on the preparedness of EDs for this increase, and what resources will be required. Methods: Semistructured telephone interview to senior and junior ED medical staff nationwide with graded responses using a Likert scale or ordinal multi-category scales to enable quantitative analysis. Results: 36 of 37 targeted hospitals were surveyed. 95 of 233 (40.1%) potential interviews were completed, including 61/61 (100%) of ED Directors. Communications systems and human resource adjustments were felt to be critical, including more supervisory staff and more time dedicated for senior medical staff to supervise. Thematic analysis confirmed the priorities were staffing and infrastructure requirements. Discussion: We recommend attention to ED communications infrastructure, an increase in rostered supervisory time for senior ED medical staff, and the provision of additional ED medical educators to teach interns.

AB  - The ultimate goal in surgical endodontics is not only the eradication of periapical pathosis but also preservation of periodontal conditions using suitable surgical techniques. Acceptable treatment outcomes are no longer possible without consideration of esthetic consequences for all involved dentoalveolar structures. During surgical endodontics the cortical bone is exposed by incising, elevating, and reflecting a full-thickness tissue flap. Certain basic principles must be considered before deciding on the type of incision and flap design. Thorough knowledge of regional anatomical structures in conjunction, as well as prevailing periodontal conditions affect and must be considered when making the proper decision on how and where to reflect the mucoperiosteal tissues. Various modes of incision can be selected, including horizontal, sulcular, submarginal, and vertical releasing incisions. The variety of flaps reflects the number of variables to be considered before choosing an appropriate flap design. While many flap designs have been suggested over the years, some have become obsolete and new techniques have emerged. It is critical that incisions and tissue elevations and reflections are performed in a way that facilitates healing by primary intention. This can be obtained by complete and sharp incision avoiding severing or traumatizing the tissues during elevation; it is equally important to prevent drying of tissue remnants on the root surface and drying of the flap during the procedure. The introduction of microsurgery to surgical endodontics attempts to minimize trauma and to enhance surgical results. Because of the combination of magnification and more delicate instruments, improved and careful tissue handling has become possible. Additional improvements in flap design and soft tissue manipulation are considered key elements in enhanced biological and esthetic outcomes of marginal soft tissues.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reduced oxygen (O2) levels (hypoxia) are present during embryogenesis and exposure to altitude and in pathologic conditions. During embryogenesis, myogenic progenitor cells reside in a hypoxic micro environment, which may regulate their activity. Satellite cells are myogenic progenitor cells localized in a local environment, suggesting that the O2 level could affect their activity during muscle regeneration. In this review, we present the idea that O2 levels regulate myogenesis and muscle regeneration, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms under lying myogenesis and muscle regeneration in hypoxia and depict the rapeutic strategies using changes in O2 levels to promote muscle regeneration. Severe hypoxia (Â£1% O2) appears detrimental for myogenic differentiation in vitro, whereas a 3?6%O2 level could promotemyogenesis. Hypoxia impairs the regenerative capacity of injured muscles. Although it remains to be explored, hypoxia may contribute to the muscle damage observed in patients with pathologies associated with hypoxia (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral arterial disease). Hypoxia affects satellite cell activity andmyogenesis throughmechanismsdependent and independent of hypoxiainducible factor-1a. Finally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and transplantation of hypoxia-conditionedmyoblasts are beneficial procedures to enhance muscle regeneration in animals. These therapies may be clinically relevant to treatment of patientswith severemuscle damage.?Chaillou, T. Lanner, J.T.

However, recent evidence appears to contradict the traditional dogmatic approach that linked cough to congestive heart failure in dogs. Here we use a question-based format to introduce and discuss the modern evidence regarding ?cardiac cough? and the interpretation of this important but often misleading clinical sign.

AB  - Abstract Objective To identify abnormalities of the celiac artery (CA) and major branches in dogs and cats by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Two hundred fifty-four dogs and 13 cats. Methods Abdominal CTA images from 2009 to 2017 were reviewed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between CA abnormalities and sex, age, size of dog, concurrent venous anomaly, or presence of gastrointestinal signs. Results Abnormalities in the CA were observed in 32 animals (11.9%) including 9 with abnormal branching (3.4%) and 23 with CA compression (8.6%). A celiacomesenteric trunk was observed in 8 (2.9%; 6 dogs, 2 cats). The splenic artery originated from the cranial mesenteric artery in 1 dog; the hepatic arterial branches originated from the left gastric artery in another. Four out of 32 animals (12.5%) with an arterial anomaly had another vascular abnormality. Large breed dogs were more likely to have an arterial anomaly (OR 4.3, 95% CI: 1.18-15.5, P?=?.02) and 12 times more likely to have CA compression (OR 12.0, 95% CI: 1.4-97.7, P?=?.02) compared to small breed dogs. Dogs with CA compression were more likely to present for gastrointestinal signs (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.2-10.3, P?=?.01). Conclusion Anomalies of the celiac trunk are apparent on CTA and may impact surgical or image-guided intervention. Compression at the origin of the CA was apparent on imaging, similar to the median arcuate ligament syndrome in people, although the significance of this finding in dogs is unknown.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To determine whether murmur intensity in small-breed dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease reflects clinical and echocardiographic disease severity. METHODS Retrospective multi-investigator study. Records of adult dogs Ã20 kg with myxomatous mitral valve disease were examined. Murmur intensity and location were recorded and compared with echocardiographic variables and functional disease status. Murmur intensities in consecutive categories were compared for prevalences of congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac remodelling. RESULTS 578 dogs [107 with ?soft? (30 Grade I/VI and 77 II/VI), 161 with ?moderate? (Grade III/VI), 160 with ?loud? (Grade IV/VI) and 150 with ?thrilling? (Grade V/VI or VI/VI) murmurs] were studied. No dogs with soft murmurs had congestive heart failure, and 90% had no remodelling. However, 56% of dogs with ?moderate?, 29% of dogs with ?loud? and 8% of dogs with ?thrilling? murmurs and subclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease also had no remodelling. Probability of a dog having congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension increased with increasing murmur intensity. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A 4-level murmur grading scheme separated clinically meaningful outcomes in small-breed dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. Soft murmurs in small-breed dogs are strongly indicative of subclinical heart disease. Thrilling murmurs are associated with more severe disease. Other murmurs are less informative on an individual basis.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate with color-power doppler sonography the arterial and venous circulation in fetal brain, in normal and pathologic circumstances. Method We studied 101 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses, 20 intrauterine growth-retarded fetuses (IUGR), 10 fetuses with cmv infections and 10 fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia. In all fetuses we obtained reliable blood flow velocity waveforms of middle cerebral and superior cerebellar artery and trasverse sinus. The pulsatility index (PI) for arterial vessels and flow velocity for venous vessels were used. Doppler measurements of AGA fetuses were compared with other fetuses. Results An increase in fetal middle cerebral PI and cerebral transverse sinus was observed in IUGR and a slightly decrease in case of fetal arrhytmia when compared with AGA fetuses. In 6 of 10 fetuses affected by cmv infection was observed a reduction in PI cerebral and cerebellar, while no difference was found for venous velocities. A longitudinal study was performed in 30 AGA and 8 IUGR fetuses. The IUGR fetuses showed a characteristic early reduction of cerebellar PI in respect to cerebral PI about 4?8?days prior the evidence of late heart rate (HR) decelerations; however, the two vessels did not differ significantly in the 4?days prior HR decelerations. Conclusion Venous and arterial cerebral circulation shown a response to pathological conditions that could affect fetal brain.

AB  - Abstract In addition to dopaminergic neuron loss, it is clear that Parkinson disease includes other pathological changes, including loss of additional neuronal populations. As a means of addressing multiple pathological changes with a single therapeutically-relevant approach, we employed delayed transplantation of a unique class of astrocytes, GDAsBMP, that are generated in vitro by directed differentiation of glial precursors. GDAsBMP produce multiple agents of interest as treatments for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including BDNF, GDNF, neurturin and IGF1. GDAsBMP also exhibit increased levels of antioxidant pathway components, including levels of NADPH and glutathione. Delayed GDABMP transplantation into the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rat striatum restored tyrosine hydroxylase expression and promoted behavioral recovery. GDABMP transplantation also rescued pathological changes not prevented in other studies, such as the rescue of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with expression of the synaptic modulatory proteins thrombospondin-1 and 2 by GDAsBMP, increased expression of the synaptic protein synaptophysin was also observed. Thus, GDAsBMP offer a multimodal support cell therapy that provides multiple benefits without requiring prior genetic manipulation.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cell disorders are uncommon but a subset of these disorders, especially mastocytoma, can histologically mimic leukemia cutis. Our objective was to employ a panel of cytochemical and immunohistolochemical markers to determine which markers would be most useful in distinguishing these entities. We studied 17 cases of cutaneous mast cell disorders (UP, TMEP, and mastocytoma) and 12 cases of leukemia cutis (myeloid, myelomonocytic and monocytic) with toluidine blue, Giemsa, pinacyanol erythrocyanate (PE), mast cell tryptase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), CD117, myeloperoxidase, CD43 and CD68. We found that PE stained the majority of cases of mast cell disorders (11/15) but did not stain leukemia cutis. Tryptase and MITF stained all cases of mast cell disorders but not leukemia cutis. Although CD117 showed strong staining in all cases of mast cell disorders, it also stained up to 25% of cases of leukemia cutis (2/8). Staining for myeloperoxidase was specific to leukemia cutis but detected only leukemias with myeloid differentiation (6/12). Our results show that mast cell tryptase and microphthalmia transcription factor are equally effective in distinguishing mast cell disorders from leukemia cutis. Interestingly, pinacyanol erythrocyanate appears to be specific for mast cell disease, as no staining was seen in leukemia cutis.

AB  - Genetic identity analysis is a procedure that may be done on paraffin blocks to determine genetic identity or non-identity of tissues. On occasion biopsy specimens from different patients are mixed up. This becomes a major problem if the subsequent diagnoses require further therapy or have other significant medical implications. We recently had such a case in which three biopsy specimens from a middle age man were possibly mixed up with that from a pre-teen age boy. The biopsy from the pre-teen was originally reported as a malignant skin tumor. Initially, the three biopsy specimens from the middle age man were sent for genetic identity analysis, which showed that one biopsy specimen was genetically different. The biopsy specimen from the pre-teen was then sent, and found to be genetically similar to the two genetically identical specimens originally submitted for the middle age man. Further confirmation of genetic identity could have been obtained by obtain further samples from both patients, but was not felt necessary in this case. We review the procedure used for genetic identity analysis as well as its other applications for this procedure in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Recent advancements in bioanalytical techniques have led to the development of novel and robust diagnostic approaches that hold promise for providing optimal patient treatment, guiding prevention programs and widening the scope of personalized medicine. However, these advanced diagnostic techniques are still complex, expensive and limited to centralized healthcare facilities orÂ research laboratories. This significantly hinders the use of evidence-based diagnostics for resource-limited settings and the primary care, thus creating a gap between healthcare providers and patients, leaving these populations without access to precision and quality medicine. Smartphone-based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging this gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability, cost-effectiveness and connectivity. Moreover, towards simplifying and automating bioanalytical techniques, biosensors and lab-on-a-chip technologies have become essential to interface and integrate these assays, bringing together the high precision and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques with the connectivity and computational power of smartphones. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of clinical smartphone diagnostics and its contributing technologies, as well as their wide range of areas of application, which span from haematology to digital pathology and rapid infectious disease diagnostics.

AB  - Two cases of dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy in 16-week-old male lurcher siblings are reported. The myopathies were characterised by regurgitation, progressive weakness and muscle wastage. The dogs had generalised weakness in all four limbs, with more pronounced weakness in the pelvic limbs. Reduced withdrawal in all limbs, muscle contracture and lingual hypertrophy were noted. Serum creatine kinase activities were markedly elevated. Electromyographic abnormalities included fibrillation potentials. Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Clinical improvement was noted in one of the cases with l-carnitine supplementation and supportive therapy. Genetic transmission of the disease was postulated as the dogs were siblings.

AB  - Background: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease characterized by acantholysis in the epithelium. PV is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages, since the oral lesions are relatively nonspecific. We report on a case with a favorable outcome due to early diagnosis and effective treatment of oral lesions. Methods: A 53-year-old Japanese woman presented with a month-long history of painful gingiva. PV was diagnosed using clinical, histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence criteria 1 month after the first visit. Evaluation of the circulating autoantibody titers to desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3 was conducted by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occlusive steroid therapy (OST) using a topical corticosteroid (0.1% triamcinolone acetonide) was provided for 8 weeks. After OST was completed, a buccal frenectomy was performed to eliminate localized toothbrushing trauma. Results: There were no adverse effects on wound healing after the procedure. No oral PV lesions were detectable at the 9-month reevaluation, and the patient remains in complete remission. The Dsg1 ELISA was negative while the Dsg3 ELISA was indeterminate at the first visit. The Dsg1 ELISA was also negative at reevaluation, but Dsg3 ELISA reactivity had increased 9 months after completion of treatment. Conclusion: Large scale clinical trials will be required to validate the clinical benefits of the OST treatment regimen, and further research is necessary to determine the importance of ELISA antibody examination in long-term management of oral PV.

AB  - Abstract Objective The paper describes novel real-time ?in situ mapping? and ?sequential occlusion angiography? to facilitate selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) using intraoperative contrast enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS). Materials and methods Data were collected and assessed for 60 patients (61 tumours) between 2009 and 2013. 31 (50.8%) tumours underwent ?Global Ischaemia?, 27 (44.3%) underwent ?Selective Ischaemia? and 3 (4.9%) were removed ?Off Clamp Zero Ischaemia?. Demographics, operative variables, complications, renal pathology and outcomes were assessed. Results Median PADUA score was 9 (range 7?10). The mean warm ischaemia time in selective ischaemia was less and statistically significant than in global ischaemia (17.1 and 21.4, respectively). Mean operative time was 163?min. Postoperative complications (n?=?10) included three (5%) Clavien grade 3 or above. Malignancy was demonstrated in 47 (77%) with negative margin in 43 (91.5%) and positive margin in four (8.5%). Long-term decrease in eGFR post selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy was less compared with global ischaemia (four and eight, respectively) but not statistically significant. Conclusions This technique is safe, feasible and cost-effective with comparable perioperative outcomes. The technical aspects elucidate the role of intraoperative CEUS to facilitate and ascertain selective ischaemia. Further work is required to demonstrate long-term oncological outcomes. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study Distal deep digital flexor tendinopathy is an important cause of foot lameness in horses that is difficult to diagnose with radiography and ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. Objective To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. Study design Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. Methods Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. Results Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images. These 42 sites also had lesions on macroscopic evaluation. There were 3 false negative and 3 false positive results identified on CECT. The sensitivity of CECT for diagnosing lesions of the DDFT in the equine foot was 93%. Conclusion CECT is an effective adjunct to the more commonly used diagnostic techniques in equine foot pain.

AB  - Objective To quantify axial radioulnar incongruence (aRUI) in dogs with simple fragmented medial coronoid process (FCP) and those with advanced medial coronoid disease (MCD). Study Design Retrospective clinical study. Sample Population Group 1: 54 elbow joints (54 dogs) with FCP, but no other visible cartilage damage. Group 2: 32 elbows (32 dogs) with Outerbridge grade 3?4 cartilage pathology of the medial coronoid?Â±?FCP. Methods aRUI was quantified using CT based 3D models of the radioulnar joint cup. A sphere was fitted to the trochlear notch of each of the 3D models and aRUI estimated in millimeters based on the relation of the sphere and the radial joint surface. Coronoid disease was diagnosed, classified, and graded using arthroscopy. Results Mean (Â±SD) aRUI for group 1 (0.2?Â±?0.8?mm) was significantly less than in group 2 (0.8?Â±?0.9?mm; P?=?.001). Overall, 14% had negative aRUI whereas 40% were congruent. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified age and aRUI, but not body weight as significant covariates. The corresponding odds ratios for advanced MCD were 1.6 for age and 6.4 for RUI, respectively. Conclusion Axial RUI is greater and more prevalent in elbows with severe cartilage disease, and consists most commonly of a short radius.
