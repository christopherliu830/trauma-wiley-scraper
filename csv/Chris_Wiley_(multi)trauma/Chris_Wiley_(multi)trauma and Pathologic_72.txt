AB  - Abstract:? Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a psychoactive amphetamine derivative widely used for recreational purposes. Deaths caused by acute drug intoxication with MDMA are rare but can often involve a severe hyperthermic episode. The factors underlying the increased risk of some ecstasy users to a fatal drug reaction are not known. We present a case report of a 24-year-old woman who developed fatal hyperthermia with multi-organ complications following MDMA use and was found at autopsy to have diffuse thyroid hyperplasia (Graves? disease). An antemortem blood MDMA concentration of 0.68?mg/L was measured in a sample obtained on admission to hospital. Although a cause and effect cannot be established, as the thyroid hormone is a major regulator of thermogenesis, we suggest that hyperthyroidism predisposed the subject to ecstasy-induced hyperthermia and that a pre-existing defect affecting temperature status could be one factor in explaining some ecstasy intoxication deaths.

AB  - Abstract Objective The paper describes novel real-time ?in situ mapping? and ?sequential occlusion angiography? to facilitate selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) using intraoperative contrast enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS). Materials and methods Data were collected and assessed for 60 patients (61 tumours) between 2009 and 2013. 31 (50.8%) tumours underwent ?Global Ischaemia?, 27 (44.3%) underwent ?Selective Ischaemia? and 3 (4.9%) were removed ?Off Clamp Zero Ischaemia?. Demographics, operative variables, complications, renal pathology and outcomes were assessed. Results Median PADUA score was 9 (range 7?10). The mean warm ischaemia time in selective ischaemia was less and statistically significant than in global ischaemia (17.1 and 21.4, respectively). Mean operative time was 163?min. Postoperative complications (n?=?10) included three (5%) Clavien grade 3 or above. Malignancy was demonstrated in 47 (77%) with negative margin in 43 (91.5%) and positive margin in four (8.5%). Long-term decrease in eGFR post selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy was less compared with global ischaemia (four and eight, respectively) but not statistically significant. Conclusions This technique is safe, feasible and cost-effective with comparable perioperative outcomes. The technical aspects elucidate the role of intraoperative CEUS to facilitate and ascertain selective ischaemia. Further work is required to demonstrate long-term oncological outcomes. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

AB  - Objective To quantify axial radioulnar incongruence (aRUI) in dogs with simple fragmented medial coronoid process (FCP) and those with advanced medial coronoid disease (MCD). Study Design Retrospective clinical study. Sample Population Group 1: 54 elbow joints (54 dogs) with FCP, but no other visible cartilage damage. Group 2: 32 elbows (32 dogs) with Outerbridge grade 3?4 cartilage pathology of the medial coronoid?±?FCP. Methods aRUI was quantified using CT based 3D models of the radioulnar joint cup. A sphere was fitted to the trochlear notch of each of the 3D models and aRUI estimated in millimeters based on the relation of the sphere and the radial joint surface. Coronoid disease was diagnosed, classified, and graded using arthroscopy. Results Mean (±SD) aRUI for group 1 (0.2?±?0.8?mm) was significantly less than in group 2 (0.8?±?0.9?mm; P?=?.001). Overall, 14% had negative aRUI whereas 40% were congruent. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified age and aRUI, but not body weight as significant covariates. The corresponding odds ratios for advanced MCD were 1.6 for age and 6.4 for RUI, respectively. Conclusion Axial RUI is greater and more prevalent in elbows with severe cartilage disease, and consists most commonly of a short radius.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use and outcome of a single, simple continuous, barbed suture line for prophylactic, total laparoscopic gastropexy in dogs. Study Design Multi-center, retrospective case series. Animals Sixty-three client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing total laparoscopic gastropexy using a barbed suture at 4 academic veterinary hospitals from 2011-2015 were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, procedure time, procedure-associated complications, short-term complications, and long-term outcome. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia in dorsal to dorsal-left oblique recumbency. Laparoscopic ports were placed on ventral midline in 1 of 3 port configurations, and 5 mm laparoscopic needle drivers were used for intracorporeal sutured gastropexy with unidirectional barbed suture. The gastropexy was positioned just caudal to the 13th rib, 2-4 cm lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle. Results Sixty-three dogs underwent total laparoscopic gastropexy with a single, simple continuous, barbed suture line. Median gastropexy surgery time was 70 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 60-90 minutes). One dog sustained splenic laceration from Veress needle penetration during initial abdominal insufflation. Short term (>24 hours to 6 months postoperative) complications included incisional seroma formation (n?=?2) and suture reaction (n?=?1). Long term (>6 months postoperative) complications included intermittent regurgitation and chronic diarrhea in 1 dog. Fifteen dogs had postoperative ultrasound and all had intact gastropexy sites. Conclusion Total laparoscopic barbed gastropexy using a single, simple continuous, barbed suture line in dogs is safe and results in an intact gastropexy long term.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition of the skin and muscles, and an underlying malignancy is noted in 10% or more of cases. Clinical features of dermatomyositis include increasing general fatigue and proximal (thighs and shoulders) muscle weakness accompanied by erythematous lesions of the skin. There have been several distinct types of dermatomyositis described. Here we describe a case of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis, which is a rare variant of dermatomyositis. A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a painful erythematous vesicular eruption of the face, trunk and extremities. In addition, edema of the face and fever were observed. Clinically, dermatomyositis was considered because of typical skin rashes (Gottron?s papules, periorbital heliotrope rash and poikiloderma) and serum creatine phosphokinase level of 1,031 IU/L. A skin biopsy was performed. Microscopically, subepidermal vesiculation with marked edema was present. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was also observed in the upper dermis. So far only a few case reports of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis have been reported in the literature. It should be kept in mind that dermatomyositis may present subepidermal vesiculation in order to avoid a misdiagnosis and unnecessary delayed treatment. Furthermore, an internal malignancy should be considered in such a variant of dermatomyositis.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - Cellular blue nevus is composed of dendritic melanocytes, together with islands of epithelioid and plump spindle cells. We examined 58 cases of blue nevi. Fourteen cases were common blue nevi. The remaining 44 blue nevi were divided into three types according to its silhouettes. These were nodular (type 1, 18 cases), nodular with notch (type 2, 16 cases), and rounded pushing patterns (type 3, 10 cases). Well circumscribed top heavy nodule was observed in type 1, and it was limited to the dermis. Type 2 showed budding appearance into the subcutaneous tissue. Type 3 revealed bottom heavy with downward pushing margin. Both type 2 and type 3 were demonstrated biphasic patterns of epithelioid and spindle cells. Perineural distribution of melanocytes was also observed in type 2 and 3. The size of these types was 3.3?mm in type 1, 4.7?mm in type 2, and 7.4?mm in type 3. The thickness of these types was 1.6?mm in type 1, 2.5?mm in type 2, and 5.2?mm in type 3. Our results suggest that cellular blue nevi may be divided into three stages. Type 1 is its early stage, and may be misinterpreted as common blue nevi.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - Materials and Methods: 247 consecutive skin specimens covering a three-month period (1/04?3/04) were reviewed to identify incidental foci of Hailey-Hailey (HH) like acantholysis and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis (FAD). Cases in which these patterns comprised the primary process were excluded. All cases were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and hematoxylin-eosin stained. Results: Six cases were identified: three shave biopsies (chest, back, face), two excisions (back, face), and one punch biopsy (scalp). This represented 2.4% of total reviewed. Four specimens had a HH like pattern (1.6%); two had FAD (0.8%). The average patient age was 68 years (range 41?86). Four patients were male; two were female. Three cases were associated with epidermal neoplasia: basal cell carcinoma (HH), actinic keratosis (HH), and malignant melanoma in situ (HH). Two were associated with significant inflammation: seborrheic keratosis (HH) and bullous lichen planus (FAD). One biopsy was of lichen simplex chronicus (FAD). The average diameter of acantholysis was 0.3?mm. Four cases showed associated prominent solar elastosis. Discussion: Incidental acantholysis with FAD and HH like patterns is uncommon. This has previously been postulated to reflect possible pre-neoplastic epidermal damage. The discussed cases show an association with epidermal neoplasia, solar change, and inflammation.

AB  - Background? Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complex rescue therapy used to provide cardiac and/or respiratory support for critically ill patients who have failed maximal conventional medical management. ECMO is based on a modified cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, and can provide cardiopulmonary support for up-to several months. It can be used in a veno venous configuration for isolated respiratory failure, (VV-ECMO), or in a veno arterial configuration (VA-ECMO) where support is necessary for cardiac +/- respiratory failure. The ECMO circuit consists of five main components: large bore cannulae (access cannulae) for drainage of the venous system, and return cannulae to either the venous ( in VV-ECMO) or arterial (in VA ECMO) system. An oxygenator, with a vast surface area of hollow filaments, allows addition of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide; a centrifugal blood pump allows propulsion of blood through the circuit at upto 10 L/minute; a control module and a thermoregulatory unit, which allows for exact temperature control of the extra corporeal blood. Methods? The first successful use of ECMO for ARDS in adults occurred in 1972, and its use has become more commonplace over the last 30 years, supported by the improvement in design and biocompatibility of the equipment, which has reduced the morbidity associated with this modality. Whilst the use of ECMO in neonatal population has been supported by numerous studies, the evidence upon which ECMO was integrated into adult practice was substantially less robust. Results? Recent data, including the CESAR study (Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Respiratory failure)has added a degree of evidence to the role of ECMO in such a patient population. The CESAR study analysed 180 patients, and confirmed that ECMO was associated with an improved rate of survival. More recently, ECMO has been utilized in numerous situations within the critical care area, including support in high-risk percutaneous interventions in cardiac catheter lab; the operating room, emergency department, as well in specialized inter-hospital retrieval services. The increased understanding of the risk:benefit profile of ECMO, along with a reduction in morbidity associated with its use will doubtless lead to a substantial rise in the utilisation of this modality. As with all extra-corporeal circuits, ECMO opposes the basic premises of the mammalian inflammation and coagulation cascade where blood comes into foreign circulation, both these cascades are activated. Anti-coagulation is readily dealt with through use of agents such as heparin, but the inflammatory excess, whilst less macroscopically obvious, continues un-abated. Platelet consumption and neutrophil activation occur rapidly, and the clinician is faced with balancing the need of anticoagulation for the circuit, against haemostasis in an acutely bleeding patient. Alterations in pharmacokinetics may result in inadequate levels of disease modifying therapeutics, such as antibiotics, hence paradoxically delaying recovery from conditions such as pneumonia. Key elements of nutrition and the innate immune system may similarly be affected. Summary? This presentation will discuss the basic features of ECMO to the non-specialist, and review the clinical conundrum faced by the team treating these most complex cases.

AB  - Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects an estimated 98,400 individuals in the UK, including 21900 who are infected but remain undiagnosed (1). The prevalence of HIV is increasing worldwide, in part due to ongoing transmission and more widespread testing, but also as a consequence of the improved life expectancy which highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought. Despite the dramatic reduction in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections in the post-HAART era, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis. Late diagnosis (defined as CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis) accounts for approximately 50% of new diagnosis in UK and Europe (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are extremely common amongst individuals living with HIV - the reasons for which are likely to be multi-factorial. Patients may experience GI side effects as a result of antiretroviral therapy or other drugs used to treat HIV-related complications. They may develop opportunistic infections affecting any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, related to their degree of immuno-compromise. Finally, their epidemiological risk group may place them at increased risk of certain diseases e.g. viral hepatitis in injecting drug users, lymphogranuloma venereum in men having sex with men (MSM). It is therefore important for GI physicians to have an awareness of the various manifestations of GI disease in HIV positive patients in order to help formulate a differential diagnosis and guide investigation in those with known infection (Table 1). Recognizing the association between specific conditions and HIV/AIDS may prompt testing by GI physicians and provide a valuable opportunity to diagnose HIV earlier resulting in better clinical outcome.

AB  - A contributing role of nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuroimmunologic mechanisms has provided a new dimension in the understanding of various cutaneous and systemic inflammatory diseases. Recent evidence implicates NGF as a key mediator of inflammation and pain. NGF influences an inflammatory reaction by regulating neuropeptides, angiogenesis, cell trafficking molecules, and T cell activation. All of these functions of NGF are relevant in maintenance or initiation of the critical biologic events in various rheumatologic conditions. The recognition of a pathologic role of NGF and its receptor system has provided an attractive opportunity to develop a novel class of therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and chronic pain syndromes. In this chapter we will discuss the role of NGF and its receptor system in psoriatic disease, inflammatory arthritis, and arthritic pain of osteoarthritis.

AB  - Abstract Clinical neurophysiologic examination of the pelvic floor is performed worldwide, but there is no consensus on the choice of tests, nor on technical details of individual methods. Standardized methods are, however, necessary to obtain their valid application in different laboratories for the purpose of collection of normative data, comparison of patient data and organization of multi-center studies. It is proposed that in patients with suspected ?lower motor neuron? type lesions concentric needle electromyography (CNEMG) is the most informative test to detect pelvic floor denervation/reinnervation, and the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle is the most appropriate muscle to be examined (either in isolation?when a selective lesion is suspected?or in addition to examination of other muscles). An algorithm consisting of standardized tests including a standardized approach to CNEMG examination of the EAS is presented. The proposed electrophysiologic assessment consists of a computer-assisted analysis of denervation and reinnervation features of the CNEMG signal, a qualitative assessment of reflex and voluntary activation of EAS motor units, and of electrical (or mechanical) elicitation of the bulbocavernosus reflex in those patients in whom manual anogenital stimulation failed to elicit a robust response in the EAS. The proposed protocol could serve as a basis for further studies on validity, sensitivity and specificity of electrophysiologic assessment in patients with different types of ?lower motor neuron? involvement of pelvic floor muscles and sacral dysfunction.

AB  - Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin is a rare tumor with a microscopic resemblance to lymphoepitheliomatous carcinoma of the nasopharynx. We present a 93-year-old man with papules on the left auricle to the cheek that were gradually enlarged. By the time of a biopsy, it grew to a 5.0???3.0???2.8?cm dark red mass, and necrotic debris was attached to the surface. Histologically, a relatively well-demarcated, dermal-hypodermic multiple lobules were composed of irregular islands of atypical epithelial cells. The uniform tumor cells had moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with one or two prominent nucleoli. A dense lymphocytic infiltrate was present within the neoplastic islands, obscuring the epithelial component. The neoplastic cells were unconnected to the overlying epidermis. Neither squamous nor glandular differentiation was present. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin, and negative for latent membrane protein 1. No Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) was detected by in situ hybridization. The negativity for Epstein-Barr virus may be a help in the differential diagnosis from metastatic undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is uniformly positive for EBER.

AB  - Background: There are only two reported cases of hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) associated with precocious puberty. Here we report a third case, and the first one to be autopsied. Design: A 5-year-old female with HI, intractable seizures and mental retardation presented with gray vaginal discharge and bacterial vaginosis. The patient subsequently died from neurologic complications and was autopsied. Results: Post-mortem examination revealed pigmentary mosaicism following the lines of Blaschko and advanced development of vulvar labia, pubic hair, and breast buds. Other significant autopsy findings included conical teeth, patchy alopecia, macrosomia (body weight and height above 95th percentile), and macrocephaly with megalencephaly (brain 1850?g). The uterus and ovaries were unremarkable. Epidermis had decreased melanocytes in hypopigmented areas. Skin fibroblast karyotype was normal. Conclusion: The two previous case reports indicate that the mechanism for precocious puberty in HI may be either biochemical, as in McCune-Albright Syndrome, or independent of GnRH. The mechanism of the precocious puberty in our case is most likely central.

AB  - Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common soft tissue sarcoma of adults. We present an unusual case which initially showed features of a pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor (PHAT). The lesion was characterized by abundant plump, eosinophilic cells exhibiting striking nuclear atypia, set in a dense, hyalinized stroma with a prominent, angiectatic vasculature. Rare mitotic figures were identified. These findings were felt to be most consistent with the diagnosis of PHAT. Four months after removal, local recurrence was noted, which demonstrated findings of a high grade MFS, including a cellular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells set in a prominent myxoid stroma. Multiple mitoses, including atypical ones, were present. In light of these findings, the original specimen was reexamined and the diagnosis was revised to high- grade MFS. MFS, especially low-grade lesions, may be confused with several benign lesions. Previous cases mimicking PHAT have not been reported. We describe a unique case of high-grade MFS which initially showed characteristic features of a PHAT, raising the possibility that MFS may occasionally arise in, or have areas that masquerade as, PHAT. It is possible that PHAT, currently considered a benign neoplasm, may actually represent a peculiar form of MFS of low malignant potential.

AB  - Background: Sun exposure plays an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Melanocytic lesions occur in sun-exposed skin and protected skin. Here we study the histologic interaction of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and solar elastosis (SE). Design: We selected 15 invasive malignant melanomas (MM) and 6 benign melanocytic nevi (MN) occurring in sun exposed areas in patients with significant SE. We measured SE thickness in perilesional skin and SE displacement in lesional skin. Results: SE thickness was 0.64?+/??0.11?mm in MM, and 0.38?+/??0.06 in MN (P?<?0.05). SE displacement was 1.02?+?/?0.85?mm in MM, and 0.44?+/??0.30 in MN (P?<?0.05). Tumor cells and host response were responsible for displacement of SE in MM. Thickness of displaced SE was decreased in 6?MM and 1?MN (attenuation), unchanged in 7?MM and 4?MN and increased in 2?MM and 1?MN. Conclusion: Displacement of SE may be helpful in the diagnosis of MM. In MM the newly formed tumor and associated host response appear to push down the preexisting solar elastosis. Conversely, long standing benign MN in sun exposed areas appear to coexist with the SE without significant displacement.
