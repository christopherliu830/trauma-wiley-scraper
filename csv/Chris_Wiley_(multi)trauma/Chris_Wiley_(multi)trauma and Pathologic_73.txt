AB  - A 40 year-old female with sero-negative arthritis presented with annular and cord-like configurations (rope sign) of asymptomatic papules and plaques along her flanks, suspected to be granuloma annulare. Medications at the time of presentation included methotrexate, prednisone, Vioxx (rofecoxib), Arava (leflunomide) and Remicade (infliximab). High-potency topical corticosteroids did not alleviate the eruption. Biopsy was performed demonstrating a deep dermal, interstitial and focally palisading granulomatous infiltrate with eosinophils. Dermal lymphangiectases were present, and the epidermis was unaffected. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination showed deep dermal, interstitial IgG, C3, and IgM deposits coating collagen bundles centered in the granulomatous infliltrate and IgG antinuclear keratinocyte reactivity. Serologic tested also revealed anti-nuclear antibodies. No other auto-antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with ?interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with cords and arthritis?. Thirteen cases of IGD with cords were identified in a literature review of which 7/12 (58%) were sero-(rheumatoid factor)-negative, 3/5 (60%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 12/13 (92%) had arthritis. One theory of pathogenesis is that immune-complex deposition in the dermis initiates a granulomatous reaction; DIF findings in this case support this proposed mechanism. IGD with cords is a singular clinicopathologic entity associated with sero-negative, non-erosive arthritis and antinuclear antibodies.

AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple café au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects an estimated 98,400 individuals in the UK, including 21900 who are infected but remain undiagnosed (1). The prevalence of HIV is increasing worldwide, in part due to ongoing transmission and more widespread testing, but also as a consequence of the improved life expectancy which highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought. Despite the dramatic reduction in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections in the post-HAART era, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis. Late diagnosis (defined as CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis) accounts for approximately 50% of new diagnosis in UK and Europe (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are extremely common amongst individuals living with HIV - the reasons for which are likely to be multi-factorial. Patients may experience GI side effects as a result of antiretroviral therapy or other drugs used to treat HIV-related complications. They may develop opportunistic infections affecting any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, related to their degree of immuno-compromise. Finally, their epidemiological risk group may place them at increased risk of certain diseases e.g. viral hepatitis in injecting drug users, lymphogranuloma venereum in men having sex with men (MSM). It is therefore important for GI physicians to have an awareness of the various manifestations of GI disease in HIV positive patients in order to help formulate a differential diagnosis and guide investigation in those with known infection (Table 1). Recognizing the association between specific conditions and HIV/AIDS may prompt testing by GI physicians and provide a valuable opportunity to diagnose HIV earlier resulting in better clinical outcome.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition of the skin and muscles, and an underlying malignancy is noted in 10% or more of cases. Clinical features of dermatomyositis include increasing general fatigue and proximal (thighs and shoulders) muscle weakness accompanied by erythematous lesions of the skin. There have been several distinct types of dermatomyositis described. Here we describe a case of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis, which is a rare variant of dermatomyositis. A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a painful erythematous vesicular eruption of the face, trunk and extremities. In addition, edema of the face and fever were observed. Clinically, dermatomyositis was considered because of typical skin rashes (Gottron?s papules, periorbital heliotrope rash and poikiloderma) and serum creatine phosphokinase level of 1,031 IU/L. A skin biopsy was performed. Microscopically, subepidermal vesiculation with marked edema was present. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was also observed in the upper dermis. So far only a few case reports of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis have been reported in the literature. It should be kept in mind that dermatomyositis may present subepidermal vesiculation in order to avoid a misdiagnosis and unnecessary delayed treatment. Furthermore, an internal malignancy should be considered in such a variant of dermatomyositis.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Infantile fibromatosis (IF) is an uncommon childhood disorder characterized by solitary or muticentric tumors involving skeletal muscle, skin, bones, or viscera. There is a wide morphologic spectrum reflecting various stages of fibroblastic differentiation. We present the clinical and histopathologic findings of a rare case of IF. A seven month old female presented with firm masses over the right elbow (2???3?cm.) and right distal clavicle (3???4?cm.). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated increased T2 signal within the soft tissues of the right axilla, supraclavicular region, and distal humerus. However, there was no evidence for bony involvement. Incisional biopsy of the supraclavicular mass showed a white fibrous grossly appearing tumor. Histologic examination revealed clusters of adipocytes and infiltration of skeletal muscle fibers by a moderately cellular proliferation of ovoid within a fibrous background. There was no atypia, necrosis, or increased mitotic activity. The tumor cells showed diffuse immunoreactivity for vimentin and weak focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. No reactivity was seen with S100. In addition, none of the tumor cells exhibited nuclear estrogen receptor expression by image cytometry. This case is reported in an effort to better define the clinical and histopathologic features of infantile fibromatosis.

AB  - We report a 43-year-old woman, in otherwise excellent health, who presented with a 4 year history of an asymptomatic, papular condition described as ?tiny little spines? involving the skin. On examination hundreds of discrete, palpable 1-mm projections were present on the upper torso and arms. Histopathology showed a small focus of acanthotic epidermis forming a small spire. Overlying the subtle epidermal elevation was a column of compact hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. Epidermal atrophy and dermal lymphocytic inflammation, characteristic of Flegel?s disease, were not observed. No features of keratosis pilaris were noted. A diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses was rendered. Relatively rare multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses is a non-follicular disorder of keratinization of unclear etiology. Previously ascribed names include, but are not limited to, disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and minute aggregate keratoses. A classification scheme with sporadic, post-inflammatory (recently challenged as another entity) and familial (autosomal dominant) types has been proposed. Other classifications are based on topography and histology or age of onset: early (20?s and 30?s) and late (40?s-50?s). Paraneoplastic syndromes have been associated with late onset type. In summary, we report a sporadic case of late-onset multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, an unusual and relatively rare disorder.

AB  - A case of cutaneous myoepithelioma is reported. A 37 year-old woman presented with a 2?cm well-circumscribed dermal nodule of the forehead. The tumor was enucleated with the clinical diagnosis of an epidermal inclusion cyst. Histologically, the tumor was located within the dermis and was well circumscribed. It was composed of spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells arranged in organoid nests. Focal areas of extracellular hyalinized stroma were present. Well-defined glandular structures, chondroid matrix, and significant nuclear pleomorphism were absent. The tumor expressed widespread cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin (using AE1/AE3) and nuclear positivity for p63. Variable reactivity was noted with EMA and S-100. The tumor was negative for smooth muscle actin, GFAP, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CEA. These immunohistochemical results supported myoepithelial differentiation. Myoepitheliomas of the skin are rare neoplasms that have only recently been recognized in the skin. A single publication has reported the diagnostic utility of p63 in the diagnosis of myoepithelial tumors of the skin. Myoepitheliomas often display variable expression of myoepithelial markers, with no single marker that is 100% sensitive. The current case highlights the need for a battery of markers, including p63, to detect myoepithelial differentiation.

AB  - Paecilomyces, a hyalohyphomycosis, is an uncommon cause of cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Most cases reported have occurred in patients with impaired host defenses or following a surgical procedure, and have proven highly resistant to anti fungal therapies. A 60-year-old man presented with scattered non-healing verrucous lesions as well as ulcers and excoriations on the upper extremities and trunk. The lesion had begun shortly after the patient was scratched by prickly okra. The patient had no underlying health problems and he was on no medication. Histology revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, with papillomatosis with intraepidermal micro-abscess formation. Within the dermis there was a mixed acute and chronic granulomatous infiltrate. With GMS stain numerous pleomorphic yeast forms and pseudohyphael forms were seen. Cultures confirmed Paecilomyces species. The patient was treated with Voriconazole with complete resolution of his lesion. Paecilomyces is an emerging fungal pathogen, which in our immune competent patient manifest as widespread cutaneous disease.

AB  - Hyaline globules (HG) are frequently found in neoplastic cells of Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS). Presence of HG, characteristic of but not specific of KS, has been considered to represent erythrophagocytosis. In order to further characterize the nature of HG, we studied 10 cases of cutaneous KS with distinct HG using immunohistochemistry for hemoglobin A, Kappa and Lambda. All KS cases were of nodular type. Also included were 3 cases of glomeruloid hemangioma with similar HG in endothelial cells for the comparision. In selected cases electron microscopic examination was performed. PAS stain with diastase digestion was also done in all cases. Results: HG were diastase resistant and PAS positive. All HG in neoplastic cells of KS and endothelial cells of GH were negative for hemoglobin A. There was variable staining for light chains: focal but strong positivity for kappa, weak and variable staining for Lambda. Some HG was positive for both kappa and lambda. Electron microscopic study demonstrated HG as homogeneous electron dense inclusions with internal small vacuoles, whorled or granular materials. Conclusions: All HG in neoplastic cells and endothelial cells of GH represent phagolysosomes. Negative stain for hemoglobin A in KS and GH do not support the inclusions being fragmented RBC?s.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Abstract Clinical neurophysiologic examination of the pelvic floor is performed worldwide, but there is no consensus on the choice of tests, nor on technical details of individual methods. Standardized methods are, however, necessary to obtain their valid application in different laboratories for the purpose of collection of normative data, comparison of patient data and organization of multi-center studies. It is proposed that in patients with suspected ?lower motor neuron? type lesions concentric needle electromyography (CNEMG) is the most informative test to detect pelvic floor denervation/reinnervation, and the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle is the most appropriate muscle to be examined (either in isolation?when a selective lesion is suspected?or in addition to examination of other muscles). An algorithm consisting of standardized tests including a standardized approach to CNEMG examination of the EAS is presented. The proposed electrophysiologic assessment consists of a computer-assisted analysis of denervation and reinnervation features of the CNEMG signal, a qualitative assessment of reflex and voluntary activation of EAS motor units, and of electrical (or mechanical) elicitation of the bulbocavernosus reflex in those patients in whom manual anogenital stimulation failed to elicit a robust response in the EAS. The proposed protocol could serve as a basis for further studies on validity, sensitivity and specificity of electrophysiologic assessment in patients with different types of ?lower motor neuron? involvement of pelvic floor muscles and sacral dysfunction.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Abstract Background Initially after tattooing, the skin barrier function is broken. However, the long-term impact of clinically healed tattoos on this has never been studied. The aim was to investigate the long-term effect on the skin barrier function in normal tattoos and examples of tattoos with chronic inflammatory complication. Methods Participants were recruited from the ?Tattoo clinic? of the Dermatological Department on Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark, where patients with complicated tattoo reactions are treated. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), conductance, capacitance, and pH were measured in tattooed skin with regional control measurements in normal non-tattooed skin. Natural moisturizing factor (NMF) was measured in collected tape strips. Results Twenty six individuals with 28 tattoos were included, that is, 23 normal tattoos without any pathologic reaction and 5 tattoos with chronic inflammatory complications. No significant differences were found in tattooed versus non-tattooed skin with respect to TEWL (median values 6.6 vs 7.2 g/m2/h), conductance (76 vs 78 a.u.), pH (5.94 vs 5.79), and NMF (0.58 vs 0.59 mmol/g protein). Capacitance (64 vs 57 a.u.) was higher in tattooed skin compared to non-tattooed skin (P = 0.006). Similar results were found in tattoos with inflammatory reactions. Conclusion Overall, skin tattoos do not affect the long-term skin barrier function markedly. The skin capacitance was, however, affected in tattooed skin areas compared to non-tattooed skin areas.

AB  - Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common soft tissue sarcoma of adults. We present an unusual case which initially showed features of a pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor (PHAT). The lesion was characterized by abundant plump, eosinophilic cells exhibiting striking nuclear atypia, set in a dense, hyalinized stroma with a prominent, angiectatic vasculature. Rare mitotic figures were identified. These findings were felt to be most consistent with the diagnosis of PHAT. Four months after removal, local recurrence was noted, which demonstrated findings of a high grade MFS, including a cellular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells set in a prominent myxoid stroma. Multiple mitoses, including atypical ones, were present. In light of these findings, the original specimen was reexamined and the diagnosis was revised to high- grade MFS. MFS, especially low-grade lesions, may be confused with several benign lesions. Previous cases mimicking PHAT have not been reported. We describe a unique case of high-grade MFS which initially showed characteristic features of a PHAT, raising the possibility that MFS may occasionally arise in, or have areas that masquerade as, PHAT. It is possible that PHAT, currently considered a benign neoplasm, may actually represent a peculiar form of MFS of low malignant potential.

AB  - Background: Sun exposure plays an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Melanocytic lesions occur in sun-exposed skin and protected skin. Here we study the histologic interaction of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and solar elastosis (SE). Design: We selected 15 invasive malignant melanomas (MM) and 6 benign melanocytic nevi (MN) occurring in sun exposed areas in patients with significant SE. We measured SE thickness in perilesional skin and SE displacement in lesional skin. Results: SE thickness was 0.64?+/??0.11?mm in MM, and 0.38?+/??0.06 in MN (P?<?0.05). SE displacement was 1.02?+?/?0.85?mm in MM, and 0.44?+/??0.30 in MN (P?<?0.05). Tumor cells and host response were responsible for displacement of SE in MM. Thickness of displaced SE was decreased in 6?MM and 1?MN (attenuation), unchanged in 7?MM and 4?MN and increased in 2?MM and 1?MN. Conclusion: Displacement of SE may be helpful in the diagnosis of MM. In MM the newly formed tumor and associated host response appear to push down the preexisting solar elastosis. Conversely, long standing benign MN in sun exposed areas appear to coexist with the SE without significant displacement.

AB  - Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. On occasion, KS may histologically mimic pyogenic granulomas (PG), a common benign vascular tumor of the skin. Using immunoperoxidase stains, we examined 28 PG and 4 PG-like KS for HHV-8 to determine the specificity of positive staining in this setting. All PG-like KS demonstrated nuclear staining for HHV-8. No staining was identified in any of the PG. Furthermore, histologic criteria often used to differentiate between these two entities were not helpful in difficult cases. The only distinguishing features were the presence/absence of HHV-8 staining and, in some cases, clinical history. The presence of HHV-8 nuclear staining appears to be a specific marker for KS when comparing PG and PG-like KS. Given the lack of distinguishing morphologic criteria, we suggest performing immunoperoxidase stains for HHV-8 on any PG occurring in a clinically atypical setting.
