AB  - An 81 yo male presented with several asymptomatic firm 1?5?cm red purple plaques on the trunk and lower extremities associated with a mild pancytopenia. Histological examination revealed a diffuse, monotonous dermal infiltrate of atypical medium sized cells with fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated positivity for CD 45, CD43, CD4, Bcl-2, and TdT; but was negative for cytokeratin, melan-A, CD30 and hematopoietic lineage specific markers. A subsequent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a dense population of cells that were morphologically consistent with blasts. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed lesional cells that expressed CD56, CD4, CD7, CD5, HLA-DR and TdT. However, lineage specific markers for B-cells (CD19, CD20, cCD79a, and CD10), T-cells (sCD3 and cCD3), and myeloid cells (CD13, CD33, CD117, cCD13, CD14, CD41, CD61, myeloperoxidase, and alpha napthyl butyrate esterase) were not expressed. Molecular studies by PCR exhibited no evidence of T-cell receptor or heavy chain gene rearrangements. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a primary cutaneous blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphomas are characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous involvement and an aggressive clinical course. Our patient responded dramatically to one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy with resolution of his cutaneous tumors.

AB  - Summary Cerebrovascular disease is common in older patients, and can present as a simple short-lived transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a devastating stroke. Other pathologies may mimic stroke or TIA and alternative diagnoses need to be considered. This chapter explains the work-up of TIA and stroke in older patients. Patients may also present to ophthalmology with central retinal artery occlusion or amaurosis fugax and will require the same work-up for cerebrovascular disease. Additional features include: Table reviewing different types of acute stroke typical symptoms and signs on examination Investigation of acute stroke and consideration of rarer causes Thrombolysis and its evidence base in older patients Management of carotid disease Risk: benefit ratio of warfarinisation in frail patients, and review of the novel anticoagulants.

AB  - Pinkus initially described eccrine poroma as a benign neoplasm of the acrosyringium. The tumor, often consisting of broad anastamosing bands, arises from the epidermis and extends downward into the dermis. However, it may be completely intraepidermal (?hidroacanthoma simplex?), and, at times, appear to be completely dermal (?dermal duct tumor?). The characteristic tumor cell is squamoid, but smaller than the epidermal squamous cell. The cell has a cuboidal appearance with a uniform basophilic nucleus, and intercellular bridges. One can usually observe a sharp line of demarcation between the adjacent epidermis and the tumor cells. The histological sections presented are offered as evidence of the eclectic nature of eccrine poroma. The examples to be discussed include: the intraepidermal variant, the intraepidermal variant with ?microcysts, the intraepidermal variant with ?macrocysts? the epidermal/classic variant, the dermal variant, the pigmented variant, the irritated variant, the chondroid variant, the syringomatous variant and the focally malignant variant. Each example has the classic features of eccrine poroma and an outstanding individual characteristic. But, all are eccrine poromas. These specimens are from the Medical College of Virginia/Francis H. McMullan collection, representing fifty years of practice, teaching and service.

AB  - Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic, various associated skin lesions have been recognized. One interesting phenomenon is chronic photosensitivity dermatitis. We report the case of a 44-year old homeless male with a 14-year history of HIV and a CD4 count of 350. He presented to us with a 5-month history of a pruritic photodistributed eruption. Physical examination revealed that he had erythematous, scaly, lichenified, and crusted plaques involving the face, neck, upper chest, and extensor extremities. Sparing of the areas under his watch and bracelet was found. A skin biopsy specimen showed psoriasiform dermatitis with an overlying thick, impetiginized, and hemorrhagic crust. There was prominent single cell necrosis throughout all epidermal layers. A lichenoid dermal infiltrate consisted mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. The patient?s presentation was consistent with a photosensitive psoriasiform interface dermatitis. The pathogenesis of this photodermatitis is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include the formation of a neoantigen due to UV exposure, depressed levels of endogenous scavengers leading to increased oxidative stress, and the onset of a pellagra-like dermatosis due to niacin-tryptophan deficiency. It is likely that several of these processes are acting in concert to cause this photoeruption.

AB  - A 40 year-old female with sero-negative arthritis presented with annular and cord-like configurations (rope sign) of asymptomatic papules and plaques along her flanks, suspected to be granuloma annulare. Medications at the time of presentation included methotrexate, prednisone, Vioxx (rofecoxib), Arava (leflunomide) and Remicade (infliximab). High-potency topical corticosteroids did not alleviate the eruption. Biopsy was performed demonstrating a deep dermal, interstitial and focally palisading granulomatous infiltrate with eosinophils. Dermal lymphangiectases were present, and the epidermis was unaffected. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination showed deep dermal, interstitial IgG, C3, and IgM deposits coating collagen bundles centered in the granulomatous infliltrate and IgG antinuclear keratinocyte reactivity. Serologic tested also revealed anti-nuclear antibodies. No other auto-antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with ?interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with cords and arthritis?. Thirteen cases of IGD with cords were identified in a literature review of which 7/12 (58%) were sero-(rheumatoid factor)-negative, 3/5 (60%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 12/13 (92%) had arthritis. One theory of pathogenesis is that immune-complex deposition in the dermis initiates a granulomatous reaction; DIF findings in this case support this proposed mechanism. IGD with cords is a singular clinicopathologic entity associated with sero-negative, non-erosive arthritis and antinuclear antibodies.

AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple café au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study The suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx (SADP) is functionally and clinically important. Objectives To investigate SADP form and function and the microanatomy of its insertion zone. Study design Descriptive gross and microanatomy. Methods The feet of 6 normal Standardbred horses were sectioned into blocks along the traditional perpendicular transverse axis and along functional axes of the SADP, decalcified and processed for staining with haematoxylin and eosin, Jones' periodic acid silver methenamine or Masson's trichrome stains. Results In traditional midline toe transverse plane sections SADP collagen bundles were irregular with an unstructured appearance. In sections made transversely along planes (70° and 30°) aligned with the long axis of the SADP, collagen bundles were arranged in linear rows. The linear bundles were continuous from their origin on parietal ridges of the distal phalanx through to the secondary epidermal lamellar basement membrane. At the parietal ridge interface the collagen bundles coalesced into smaller, strongly silver staining, linear structures that penetrated the cortical bone and merged with adjacent osteons. In proximal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also linear, angled at 70° to the ground surface. In distal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also arranged linearly but in a multi-angled, ?spokes of a wheel? arrangement, centred on the distal phalanx apex. Conclusions Sectioning along functional axes demonstrated the true suspensory nature of the SADP connecting the parietal surface to the lamellar hoof wall. SADP/distal phalanx insertions showed penetrating fibres extending through the chondral?apophyseal interface up to and between distal phalanx osteons. Lamellar measurements made from sections perpendicular to the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx are underestimations but if made along the longer, functional midline 70° transverse plane would accurately reflect the suspensory function of the lamellae. Laminitis pathophysiology correctly viewed as SADP degradation should inform logical, future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract Background Initially after tattooing, the skin barrier function is broken. However, the long-term impact of clinically healed tattoos on this has never been studied. The aim was to investigate the long-term effect on the skin barrier function in normal tattoos and examples of tattoos with chronic inflammatory complication. Methods Participants were recruited from the ?Tattoo clinic? of the Dermatological Department on Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark, where patients with complicated tattoo reactions are treated. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), conductance, capacitance, and pH were measured in tattooed skin with regional control measurements in normal non-tattooed skin. Natural moisturizing factor (NMF) was measured in collected tape strips. Results Twenty six individuals with 28 tattoos were included, that is, 23 normal tattoos without any pathologic reaction and 5 tattoos with chronic inflammatory complications. No significant differences were found in tattooed versus non-tattooed skin with respect to TEWL (median values 6.6 vs 7.2 g/m2/h), conductance (76 vs 78 a.u.), pH (5.94 vs 5.79), and NMF (0.58 vs 0.59 mmol/g protein). Capacitance (64 vs 57 a.u.) was higher in tattooed skin compared to non-tattooed skin (P = 0.006). Similar results were found in tattoos with inflammatory reactions. Conclusion Overall, skin tattoos do not affect the long-term skin barrier function markedly. The skin capacitance was, however, affected in tattooed skin areas compared to non-tattooed skin areas.

AB  - The recognized breadth of dysplastic nevi has quickly shrunk. We now present very small dysplastic nevi below any described breadth. A cluster of mostly punched-out nevi derived from a single clinician who recognizes as ?atypical? even very small lesions was also assigned histologic dysplasia on architectural and cytologic basis. From 536 junctional nevi with dysplasia ranging from mild to moderate, 136 (25.3%) were 1?mm. in vitro or less while 371 (69.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Among 155 compound nevi with the same range of dysplasia, 19 (12.2%) were 1?mm or less and 95 (61.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Moderate or, less so, severe atypia was even seen in more than half of either 18 junctional and 18 compound nevi of dysplastic type between 2.1 and 3?mm. While the above threshold for dysplasia may not be similar to the one than many dermatopathologists could use, it is still evident that sliding down our higher-grade nevi to meet milder degrees of perceived atypia in a more conservative diagnostic scale, the breadth of these nevi still remains minuscule in general. In sum, we adhere to the idea that dysplastic nevi are not only common but can be extremely small: ?bonsai nevi.?

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - ABSTRACT This qualitative study examined the alienated mothers' experience of motherhood. Data were collected by in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 women whose children refused any contact with them. Findings revealed one main theme, ?Merging vs. detachment?, consisting of four subthemes or motifs in these women's narratives: (i) marriage as an illusion of salvation from an abusive home; (ii) giving birth to a child as compensation for chaotic childhood experiences; (iii) husband exploiting and abusing their sense of failing motherhood; and (iv) the husband and mother-in-law expelling the mother. These findings were interpreted within the framework of Bowen's theory. The interpretation suggests that impairment in the mothers' and ex-husbands' differentiation of the self is manifest in the shattered mother?child relations and in the mothers' loss of their children in the struggle with their mothers-in-law. Implications for practice are included.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Rosai-Dorfman disease, or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), is a rare benign disease of unknown etiology that involves the cervical lymph nodes. Histologic findings include emperiopolesis of lymphocytes and S-100 protein positivity. Extranodal involvement occurs in 30?40% of cases, often involving skin. However, cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease without lymph node involvement is uncommon. We describe a case of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease and discuss its clinical and histopathologic findings. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-year history of a slowly enlarging violaceous mass on the mid-upper abdomen. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma two-year ago and was asymptomatic without any systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed a large, violaceous mass of mid-upper abdomen with several violaceous nodules surrounding the periphery. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Punch biopsy showed diffuse dermal infiltrates composed of central xanthomatous cells surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Focal germinal center was noted. Immunostaining revealed strong S-100 and CD68 reactivity of central xanthomatous cells and kappa and lambda polyclonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Special stains for infectious disorder were negative. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign reactive process, often under-recognized due to lack of systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. A high index of diagnostic awareness is required for its recognition.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare, recently described fibrotic skin condition that primarily affects patients with a history of renal disease.We report 2 cases of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and review clinical and histopathologic features with differential diagnosis and more.Case #1 was a 64-year-old black male with chronic renal insufficiency which progressed to end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. After two days, he developed blisters on both his hands. By a month, his blister lesions resolved leaving scaly skin with some skin thickening and tightening in the hands and forearms. Over the course of one month, skin over above-mentioned areas began to harden and stiffen. His fingers began to coalesce and contract resulting in fixation of hand grip. He also developed flexing contracts at the elbows bilaterally. Skin biopsy revealed the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with giant cells reaction. Case #2 was a 44-year-old black male with a hx of nephropathy. He eventually developed end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. One month after, he was found to have thickened, sclerotic appearing skin involving the upper back, hands, and forearms with flexing contracts of the all the small joints. Histopathology was most consistent with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.

AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumours are addressed together with other mesenchymal tumours of the small bowel, including smooth muscle tumours, vascular lesions, neural lesions, inflammatory fibroid polyp of the small intestine and sarcomas with characteristic translocations, especially clear cell sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract, which usually arises in the small bowel. As the small bowel mesentery is the most common site for some conditions (mesenteric fibromatosis, sclerosing mesenteritis and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour), they are briefly outlined here but also addressed elsewhere.

AB  - Summary Minimally invasive surgery modalities are associated with decreased morbidity when compared with open reconstructive techniques. Therefore, minimally invasive surgery has an expanding role in the management of ureteric reconstruction. Management of various ureteral pathologies requiring reconstruction of the ureter by pure laparoscopy is technically demanding and requires efficiency with intracorporeal suturing. Robotics solves many of the technical complexities that may be prohibitive with standard laparoscopic surgery since suturing is made easier for the inexperienced. However, continued study of cost-effectiveness is necessary to define the optimal role for robotic reconstruction in both medical and economic terms. The entire range of ureteral reconstructive procedures has been performed by either conventional or robot-assisted laparoscopy. Despite low volume of upper tract reconstruction performed in adults compared to other laparoscopic cases, many studies demonstrate equivalent or superior outcomes in comparison to traditional open techniques.

AB  - Abstract Keypoints The diabetic foot remains an enormous public health problem despite modern advances in foot care. There is a lack of evidence for many diabetic foot interventions: however, there is consensus between experts that a multi-disciplinary spproach helps reduce amputations.

AB  - Abstract Background Sarcoidosis is a multi-system granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The skin is involved in 25% of cases. Studies on cutaneous sarcoidosis from our region are lacking. Objectives This study was conducted to describe clinical and histopathologic findings in all patients diagnosed with cutaneous sarcoidosis at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between 1992 and 2010 and to compare findings with those published in the literature. Methods Clinical charts of patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed. Extracutaneous lesions were classified by organ involvement. Treatment was documented. Pathology specimens were reviewed. Results Cutaneous sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 76 Lebanese patients, 79% of whom were women. Mean age at diagnosis was 48 years. A total of 29% of patients had systemic disease that was commonly associated with lupus pernio lesions and subcutaneous sarcoidosis. The most common cutaneous lesions were sarcoidal plaques. The histopathologic features in our series did not differ from those described in the literature, except for the documented presence of a grenz zone. Interestingly, 23% of biopsy specimens contained perineural granulomas, raising the possibility of tuberculoid or borderline tuberculoid leprosy. Foreign bodies were detected in 10% of cases (all had systemic involvement), supporting the opinion that sarcoidosis and granulomatous foreign body reaction are not mutually exclusive. Conclusions The clinical and histopathologic features of cutaneous sarcoidosis patients in the present series are generally comparable with those published in the literature, with minor differences. Clinically, the most commonly seen lesion was plaque. Microscopically, cutaneous sarcoidosis may exhibit a grenz zone and may show perineural inflammation and foreign bodies.
