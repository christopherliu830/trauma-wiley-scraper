AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - Hair erector muscle (HEM) is everywhere in dermatopathology but has been less studied than other smooth muscle systems in the skin. HEM disorders are passive and active, the former related to the involvement, as a bystander fascicle, by nearby conditions. The muscle can be permeated by nevus cells, infiltrated or destroyed by keratoacanthoma and other malignancies, encroached by hemangiomas, suffused by erythrocytes in purpura and pyocytes in an abscess, incorporated into scars and entrapped and deformed by a dermatofibroma. Less passively, HEM can participate in follicular processes, insect bites, collagen-vascular diseases, syphilis, solar elastosis and amyloid. More proper to the muscle yet rarely encountered are myositis (dermatomyositis), poorly understood myopathies (atrophy, vacuolar changes, eosinophilic globules), deposit diseases (glycogenosis) and, even, rare dystrophies (Duchenne/Becker). Finally, other than HEM tumors (leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma), hamartomatous conditions include disorganized/hypertrophic muscle in blue nevi, hyperplasia in Becker?s nevus, and more substantial muscle mass increase as in smooth muscle hamartoma (including similar changes in mature port-wine stain) and in the rare congenital midline hamartoma. This presentation outlines orderly features and, mainly, compiles disorders of HEM, few of them a disease on its own but still a supplement to a gamut of many more noticeable entities.

AB  - Case 1: A 38 year-old man presented with a painless right post auricular mass, slowly growing for ten years. Clinical impression was a salivary gland lesion. The excised mass measured 3?cm and was gelatinous. Case 2: A 28 year-old man presented with a lump in the region of the left heel, slowly growing for several years. Excision revealed a lobulated pink-gray mass measuring 2?cm. In both cases, histology demonstrated a circumscribed encapsulated proliferation of tumour cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma. There were almost exclusively hyaline cells with plasmacytoid features, arranged predominantly in nests and sheets with abundant pink cytoplasm and hyaline inclusions. Round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and rare mitotic figures were seen. Both cases stained strongly positive for low molecular weight cytokeratin, S 100 and vimentin and were negative for desmin, smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin. We describe two cases of hyaline cell-rich chondroid syringoma, a histologically benign entity. The importance in recognizing this entity is that these tumors can easily be confused with malignant neoplasms including malignant melanoma, myxoid chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Follow up for a year has shown no evidence of metastases or recurrence in both cases.

AB  - Psoriasis is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease that afflicts 2?3% of the world population. There is no cure and the precise cause of psoriasis is unknown. Cytokines however, have been established as critical mediators in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. EGR-2 is an immediate early serum response gene that codes for Krox-20, a zinc finger transcription factors that is important in resisting TGF-? mediated apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate Krox-20 expression in epidermal keratinocytes in psoriasis where aberrant response to TGF-? signaling has been shown to occur. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (N?=?38) including nine psoriatic plaques (PP), nine lichen planus (LP), ten lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), and ten normal skin (NS) were evaluated for expression of Krox-20 by immunohistochemistry. Frequency and relative intensity of nuclear labeling were evaluated. Strong and diffuse nuclear labeling of keratinocytes was observed in all PP and LSC. The frequency of labeling was significantly greater (p?<?0.05) in PP and LSC compared to NS. Lichen planus tended toward absent to weak nuclear labeling of keratinocytes. The increased frequency of Krox-20 expression in PP and LSC may lead to resistance of TGF-? mediated apoptosis and contribute to epidermal hyperplasia common to these disorders.

AB  - An 85-year-old woman developed a tumor on her left thigh, thought to be a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Microscopy revealed irregularly shaped, bulbous and deep aggregates of pale/clear cells emanating from the surface and reaching the lowermost dermis. This asymmetric mass of keratinocytes showed focal necrosis and dyskeratosis but no frank anaplasia, mitoses or infiltrative pattern. The interface with the dermis was blunt but irregularly undersurfaced. A more characteristic pale cell acanthoma (PCA) was colliding with it and consisted of a superficial, more regularly psoriasiform proliferation with thin suprapapillary plates and erosion but no necrosis. While it has been known that PCA can be unusual polypoid, large or atypical no author has proposed that some of the latter variants could represent a malignancy, more akin to verrucous carcinoma than to conventional SCC, due to the paucity of overt anaplastic features and the underestimation of pushing invasion and low cytologic atypia as defining traits of malignancy. One case of SCC in situ with PCA has been recently acknowledged but this is not what we are reporting: We propose that voluminous, misshapen, asymmetric or deep ?PCAs? may be low-grade carcinomas with pale cell differentiation and likely origin in a pre-existing PCA.

The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Summary Alopecia may occur anywhere on the body of guinea pigs. Skin scrapings, biopsies, histopathology, special histologic staining, and fungal or microbiologic culturing are all suitable ancillary techniques for determining an etiologic basis for suspected infectious causes of alopecia in guinea pigs. Animal housing and management practices should be evaluated closely in simple cases of alopecia, looking for potential sources of abrasions or rough surfaces in which hair may be caught. Adequacy of diet should be ascertained, particularly with respect to vitamin C content. There are few published reports of neurologic disorders in guinea pigs. Head tilt, circling, and head shaking may be seen with bacterial infections of the middle and inner ear. Cataracts with or without nuclear sclerosis are common findings in guinea pigs and may invol.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare, recently described fibrotic skin condition that primarily affects patients with a history of renal disease.We report 2 cases of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and review clinical and histopathologic features with differential diagnosis and more.Case #1 was a 64-year-old black male with chronic renal insufficiency which progressed to end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. After two days, he developed blisters on both his hands. By a month, his blister lesions resolved leaving scaly skin with some skin thickening and tightening in the hands and forearms. Over the course of one month, skin over above-mentioned areas began to harden and stiffen. His fingers began to coalesce and contract resulting in fixation of hand grip. He also developed flexing contracts at the elbows bilaterally. Skin biopsy revealed the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with giant cells reaction. Case #2 was a 44-year-old black male with a hx of nephropathy. He eventually developed end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. One month after, he was found to have thickened, sclerotic appearing skin involving the upper back, hands, and forearms with flexing contracts of the all the small joints. Histopathology was most consistent with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.

AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - Abstract Many combat veterans with PTSD have co-occurring symptoms of other forms of psychopathology; however, there have been limited studies examining personality disorders among this population. The few extant studies typically have assessed only two or three personality disorders or examined a small sample, resulting in an incomplete picture and scope of comorbidity. This study assessed all DSM-III-R personality disorders in 107 veterans in a specialized, inpatient unit. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, 79.4% of the participants were diagnosed with at least one personality disorder: 29.9% received only one diagnosis, 2l.5% had two, 15.9% had three, and 12.1% had four or more. The most frequent single diagnoses were Avoidant (47.2%), Paranoid (46.2%), Obsessive-Compulsive (28.3%), and Antisocial (15.1%) personality disorders.

AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterised by extreme pain and dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system in one region of the body, usually an extremity.(1) It involves the somatosensory, sympathetic and the somato-motor systems. It consists of local neurogenic inflammation out of proportion to injury; severe pain in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and joints; and central hyperexcitability that is often compounded with a sympathetic component. It is multifaceted manifesting both central and peripheral neurologic pathophysiology, including a prominent psychosocial component. Mechanisms include trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation and cortical reorganisation.(2) Diagnostic criteria and tests used will be discussed. Biomedical interventions include the use of primary and secondary analgesics, neural blockade, sympatholysis, ketamine, bisphosphonates, and spinal cord/peripheral nerve stimulation. Psychological and behavioural factors can exacerbate the pain and dysfunction associated with CRPS.(3) Mirror visual feedback was introduced recently for rehabilitation but needs to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.(4)

AB  - Epithelial cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice, most usually as epidermoid (infundibular) cysts, and trichilemmal (pilar) cysts. A multitude of other cystic structures can arise from the pilosebaceous unit, including dermoid cyst, pilonidal cyst, eruptive vellus hair cyst, steatocystoma, pilomatricoma, as well as eccrine and apocrine hydrocystoma. Epidermoid cysts are thought to derive from the follicular infundibulum, and express keratin 10 but not keratin 17, whereas trichilemmal cysts are believed to derive from the follicular isthmus, and express both keratins 10 and 17. Proliferating follicular cysts generally exhibit trichilemmal keratinization. In addition to the various aforementioned cysts, hybrid cysts have been reported. The majority of hybrid cysts described have been epidermoid-trichilemmal, in which the upper portion of the cyst shows epidermoid keratinization with a sharp transition inferiorly to trichilemmal keratinization. However other hybrid variants have been reported, including epidermoid-pilomatricoma, epidermoid-apocrine hydrocystoma, trichilemmal-pilomatricoma, eruptive vellus hair cyst-steatocystoma, and eruptive vellus hair cyst-trichilemmal cysts. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a proliferating hybrid cyst containing both epidermoid and trichilemmal components, which presented on the scrotum of a 44-year-old man.

AB  - A 7-month-old male infant presented with a 2?month history of a solitary, well circumscribed, 1.2?cm right parietal scalp lesion. An MRI excluded intracranial extension of the lesion. Grossly the excised lesion was tan-grey, soft to rubbery with focal areas of hemorrhage. On histology, the lesion demonstrated elongated strands of haphazardly arranged fibrous tissue and meningothelial elements with clusters of plump, cuboidal epitheloid cells extending along connective tissue planes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The meningothelial elements were intimately admixed with mature adipose tissue and proliferation of small to medium sized vessels. The overlying epidermis was unremarkable. No mitotic figures or areas of necrosis were identified. The meningothelial cells were positive for Vimentin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen. S-100 protein was negative and CD-34 was positive only in the endothelial cells. The gross, histologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with ectopic meningothelial hamartoma of the scalp. The meningothelial elements characteristic of this entity are believed to arise from displaced, ectopic meningothelial rests in the scalp and are thus regarded as simply representing a proliferation of the hamartomatous process.

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Mature cystic ovarian teratomas (MCOT) are the most common ovarian neoplasm and contain components of one or more embryonic germ cell layers. Ectodermal components are most common. Rarely (1?3%), malignant transformation can occur in MCOT and are usually epidermoid, although multiple case reports of melanomas have been described. Four compound nevi and three blue nevi have also been reported; however, atypical (dysplastic) nevi have not been reported to our knowledge. A 28-year-old woman presented with a right ovarian mass. A 5???4???2.5?cm cystic ovarian mass was filled with hair and grumous keratinaceous debris. The lining was smooth with a 1?cm dark macule. Histologically, the mass was predominantly lined by epidermis and appendages. The pigmented lesion consisted predominantly of melanocytic nests irregularly disposed on sides and tips of distorted rete ridges, some with bridging between adjacent rete ridges, and junctional extension lateral to the small dermal component of nevus. Slight fibrosis invested some rete ridges. Moderate atypia was present. Although melanomas and melanocytic nevi have rarely been described previously in MCOT, we present the first atypical (dysplastic) compound nevus, to our knowledge. This case expands the spectrum of melanocytic lesions arising in MCOT.

AB  - Physicians of various specialties submit cases for histopathological examination. Using the dermatopathology report as an objective verification tool of clinical diagnostic accuracy we assessed the diagnostic abilities of nondermatologist physicians, who performed various types of skin biopsies, and compared them with those of dermatologists. In total, 4,451 cases were analyzed. Dermatologists diagnosed twice the number of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions correctly (75%) than nondermatologists (40%). The clinical diagnosis rendered by family practitioners matched only in 26% the histopathological diagnosis. Plastic surgeons did better than family physicians but still had a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 45% for skin tumors. Inflammatory skin diseases were correctly diagnosed in 71% of the cases by dermatologists but in only 34% of the cases by nondermatologists. In our view, it is appropriate for nondermatologists to perform skin biopsies only, if they have required sufficient knowledge in basic dermatology and dermatopathology. A skin biopsy consists not only of the technical aspects of the actual procedure but necessitates an understanding of basic dermatology and dermatopathology to facilitate clinicopathological correlation.
