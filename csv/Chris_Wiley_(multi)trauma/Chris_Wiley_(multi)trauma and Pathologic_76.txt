AB  - Abstract Many combat veterans with PTSD have co-occurring symptoms of other forms of psychopathology; however, there have been limited studies examining personality disorders among this population. The few extant studies typically have assessed only two or three personality disorders or examined a small sample, resulting in an incomplete picture and scope of comorbidity. This study assessed all DSM-III-R personality disorders in 107 veterans in a specialized, inpatient unit. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, 79.4% of the participants were diagnosed with at least one personality disorder: 29.9% received only one diagnosis, 2l.5% had two, 15.9% had three, and 12.1% had four or more. The most frequent single diagnoses were Avoidant (47.2%), Paranoid (46.2%), Obsessive-Compulsive (28.3%), and Antisocial (15.1%) personality disorders.

AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterised by extreme pain and dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system in one region of the body, usually an extremity.(1) It involves the somatosensory, sympathetic and the somato-motor systems. It consists of local neurogenic inflammation out of proportion to injury; severe pain in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and joints; and central hyperexcitability that is often compounded with a sympathetic component. It is multifaceted manifesting both central and peripheral neurologic pathophysiology, including a prominent psychosocial component. Mechanisms include trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation and cortical reorganisation.(2) Diagnostic criteria and tests used will be discussed. Biomedical interventions include the use of primary and secondary analgesics, neural blockade, sympatholysis, ketamine, bisphosphonates, and spinal cord/peripheral nerve stimulation. Psychological and behavioural factors can exacerbate the pain and dysfunction associated with CRPS.(3) Mirror visual feedback was introduced recently for rehabilitation but needs to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.(4)

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Mature cystic ovarian teratomas (MCOT) are the most common ovarian neoplasm and contain components of one or more embryonic germ cell layers. Ectodermal components are most common. Rarely (1?3%), malignant transformation can occur in MCOT and are usually epidermoid, although multiple case reports of melanomas have been described. Four compound nevi and three blue nevi have also been reported; however, atypical (dysplastic) nevi have not been reported to our knowledge. A 28-year-old woman presented with a right ovarian mass. A 5???4???2.5?cm cystic ovarian mass was filled with hair and grumous keratinaceous debris. The lining was smooth with a 1?cm dark macule. Histologically, the mass was predominantly lined by epidermis and appendages. The pigmented lesion consisted predominantly of melanocytic nests irregularly disposed on sides and tips of distorted rete ridges, some with bridging between adjacent rete ridges, and junctional extension lateral to the small dermal component of nevus. Slight fibrosis invested some rete ridges. Moderate atypia was present. Although melanomas and melanocytic nevi have rarely been described previously in MCOT, we present the first atypical (dysplastic) compound nevus, to our knowledge. This case expands the spectrum of melanocytic lesions arising in MCOT.

AB  - Physicians of various specialties submit cases for histopathological examination. Using the dermatopathology report as an objective verification tool of clinical diagnostic accuracy we assessed the diagnostic abilities of nondermatologist physicians, who performed various types of skin biopsies, and compared them with those of dermatologists. In total, 4,451 cases were analyzed. Dermatologists diagnosed twice the number of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions correctly (75%) than nondermatologists (40%). The clinical diagnosis rendered by family practitioners matched only in 26% the histopathological diagnosis. Plastic surgeons did better than family physicians but still had a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 45% for skin tumors. Inflammatory skin diseases were correctly diagnosed in 71% of the cases by dermatologists but in only 34% of the cases by nondermatologists. In our view, it is appropriate for nondermatologists to perform skin biopsies only, if they have required sufficient knowledge in basic dermatology and dermatopathology. A skin biopsy consists not only of the technical aspects of the actual procedure but necessitates an understanding of basic dermatology and dermatopathology to facilitate clinicopathological correlation.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented with an eczematous patch on the left proximal inner arm of 12 years duration. She had previously been treated with emollients and topical steroids without complete resolution. The patient denied constitutional symptoms but did note eczematous patches on her buttocks of one-year duration and new eczematous patches on her inner left thigh and right inner upper arm. Upon exam, all lesions were slightly scaly without induration. The primary lesion was a poikilodermatous 4???10?cm rough plaque. No lymphadenopathy was noted. A total of five lesional biopsies were obtained. All of the biopsies demonstrated a superficial infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei and prominent epidermotropism including the formation of Pautrier?s microabcesses. The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was rendered. This case is significant for its onset at two years of age, the benignity of its course over a 12 year period and the long duration before definitive diagnosis was obtained. Mycosis fungoides needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of recalcitrant eczematous disease even in young children.

AB  - The inconsistent use of the term ?erythema annulare centrifugum? has created confusion, in that it has been applied to a group of distinct diseases as if they were a single condition. The literature becomes more ambiguous when different names are given to annular eruptions that have a similar pathogenesis. We present two neonates who presented at birth with similar diffuse erythematous annular eruptions, but differed in their serologic and histopathologic findings. The first child was otherwise healthy and had normal laboratories findings that excluded both infectious and autoimmune diseases. His biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate throughout the entire dermis that was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous eosinophils. The second neonate had elevated anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, thrombocytopenia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. His biopsy showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. There was a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate that extended throughout the dermis which consisted primarily of nuclear debris. Within the cytoplasm of the few intact histiocytes and neutrophils, were hematoxylin bodies, giving these cells the appearance of LE cells. We discuss the clinical and histopathological findings in these two neonates and attempt to clarify the nomenclature pertaining to the annular erythemas.

AB  - Although cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) may show divergent differentiation including tubular/glandular, squamous, eccrine, and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, a diffuse glandular pattern is exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a case of MCC with prominent tubulo-glandular differentiation, which precluded a definitive diagnosis in the initial punch biopsy. The patient was a 43 year-old male with 5?6 weeks history of a rapidly growing plaque at his back. A punch biopsy revealed an infiltrating lesion consisting of tubulo-glandular structures lined by hyperchromatic basaloid cells, along with some angulated, basaloid tumor nests embedded in a desmoplastic stroma. Immunostains revealed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for chromogranin and BerEP4, variably positive for CK7 and CK5/6, but negative for CK20, synaptophysin, S-100, EMA, GCDFP-15, ER/PR, TTF1 and CEA. The reexcision specimen showed multifocal epidermotropism and typical finely stippled nuclear chromatin. Although the lack of CK20 staining is unusual, the histologic characteristics along with the remaining immunohistochemical studies favor the diagnosis of a primary cutaneous neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (MCC) over the variants of microcystic adnexal carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Our case illustrates that prominent glandular differentiation may occur in MCC, and sometime create difficulty in definitive diagnosis in small biopsy specimen.

AB  - Free-living amebae are ubiquitous in our environment, but rarely cause cutaneous infection. Balamuthia mandrillaris has a predilection for infecting skin of the central face. Infection may be restricted to the skin or associated with life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We report a case of a 91-year-old woman, who presented with a non-healing red plaque over her right cheek. Several punch biopsies exhibited non-specific granulomatous inflammation without demonstrable fungi or mycobacteria in histochemical stains. She was treated empirically for granulomatous rosacea, but the lesion continued to progress. A larger incisional biopsy was performed in which amebae were observed in hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. These were retrospectively apparent in the prior punch biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction studies identified the organisms as Balamuthia mandrillaris. Cutaneous infection by B. mandrillaris is a rare condition that is sometimes complicated by life-threatening CNS involvement and which often evades timely diagnosis due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations. Moreover, these amebae are easily overlooked in histopathologic sections because of their small number and their resemblance to histiocytes. Dermatopathologists should be familiar with the histopathologic appearance of these organisms and include balamuthiasis and other amebic infections in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - We report six cases of a basaloid neoplasm arising on the head and neck showing immature sebaceous gland and focal immature hair follicle differentiation. Four cases arose in the periorbital area, one on the lower lip, and one on the neck. In all six cases extensive involvement of the surrounding soft tissues was observed. In five cases the tumor involved and was particularly aggressive in bone, requiring extensive resection. In two cases tumor extended to and involved the dura mater of the brain. Three cases required enucleation. Patients ranged in age from 30 to 81 years and consisted of four males and two females. No infection, syndrome, or other predisposing factor was known to be present. No patient was known to be a smoker or to engage in any other risk activity for cancer. No evidence of metastasis was noted in any patient. We conclude that the basaloid neoplasm showing immature pilo-sebaceous differentiation of the head and neck is a distinct entity with a much more aggressive course than basal cell carcinoma and a different progression from that of any other adnexal neoplasm, including sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - Background: Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins. The role of cyclin D1 in the development, progression and prognosis of melanomas is controversial. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin. Methods: A total of 101 melanocytic lesions of the skin including compound nevi (21), intradermal nevi (18), melanoma in situ (3), primary invasive melanoma (30), and metastatic melanoma (29) were evaluated for cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The following tiered system was used for scoring: 0% of cells with nuclear staining (score 0), 1?19% nuclear staining (score 1), 20?49% nuclear staining (score 2), and 50% or greater nuclear staining (score 3). Results: The average score for primary melanomas was significantly higher compared to nevi (p?=?0.0046), and for in situ melanomas compared to primary invasive melanomas (p?=?0.011). There was slightly higher level of expression in compound nevi versus intradermal nevi. Conclusion: Our study indicates that cyclin D1 expression is increased in malignant compared to benign melanocytic lesions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the biological role of cyclin D1 in melanocytic lesions of the skin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.
