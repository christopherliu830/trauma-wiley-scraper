AB  - Retinoic X receptor-b (RXR-b) is a heterodimerization partner for vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 activation of VDR leads to growth inhibition in numerous cell lines, including some melanoma lines. Evaluation of VDR and RXR-b expression in vivo in melanocytic neoplasms will increase our understanding of this pathways potential role in growth control. Previous studies in our laboratory showed decreased VDR expression in superficially invasive melanoma, and progressive loss of expression in deeply invasive melanomas and metastatic melanomas (MET). We next sought to evaluate RXR-b expression. Twenty-eight melanocytic neoplasms including 8 melanomas in situ (MIS), 9 primary invasive melanomas (PIM), and 11 MET were evaluated for RXR-b expression by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear labeling was assessed as 0 (0%), 1+(<5%), 2+(>5% but <50%), or 3+(>=50%). A significant increase in RXR-b expression from low (0?1+) to high (>1+) was found when comparing MIS to PIM and MET (chi2 p?<?0.05). These data suggest: 1) potential loss of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced growth inhibition during melanoma progression may be due to decreased VDR expression without concomitant loss of RXR-b; and 2) increased RXR-b expression during melanoma progression may offer selective advantage through alternative signaling pathways.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - p63, a recently identified homologue of p53 gene, has been reported to be essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms versus adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis using p63 monoclonal antibody (clone 4A4) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 10 malignant adnexal tumors, and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) benign adnexal tumors showed strong p63 expression; the remaining 7(35%) cases had over 50% p63-positive nuclei. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive for p63 (p?<?0.0001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.

AB  - A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with a ten-year history of flushing and facial swelling partially responsive to anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial therapies. Progressive edema of the right upper eyelid was recently treated by blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty specimen had a dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes. The granulomas appeared both peri-and intralymphatic with prominent molding. Special stains and polarization studies were negative. To confirm the intralymphatic location of these granulomas we performed immunohistochemical staining with Factor VIII and D2?40. D2?40 is a new monoclonal antibody that reacts with an O-linked sialoglycoprotein found on lymphatic endothelium, fetal testis, and on the surface of testicular germ cell tumors. In recent studies, clone D2?40 has shown staining in lymphatic channel endothelium but not in adjacent capillary. Factor VIII antibody highlighted both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, while D2?40 stained only the lymphatic endothelium and confirmed the intra-lymphatic location of granulomas. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatous lymphangiitis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal type (orofacial granulomatosis). Granulomatous lymphangiitis is characteristic but not completely diagnostic of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. We present the complex differential diagnosis of intralymphatic granulomas and the use of a new monoclonal antibody helpful in verifying their location.

AB  - A 53 year old woman with CML in the chronic phase received therapy with Imatinib on two separate occasions. Both occasions were followed by the development of an abrupt onset of skin lesions characterized by painful and tender erythematous plaques and nodules on the upper extremities that subsequently resolved with hyperpigmentation. The patient was also found to have pleural and pericardial effusions. She had a WBC count of 57,250 cells per mm3, a platelet count of 740,000 per mm3 and a single temperature spike of 100.4 °F. Over the course of a week the WBC count dropped to 51,520 cells per mm3 but the percent of mature neutrophils rose to 55%. Imatinib was discontinued and steroid therapy led to resolution of the skin lesions with residual pigmentation. A skin biopsy was obtained that showed neutrophilic dermatosis with epidermal sparing consistent with Sweet's syndrome but with atypical features such as extension into deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. Lab work up including blood cultures and bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures of the skin as well as special stains of the skin biopsy specimen failed to reveal any microbiological etiology.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a common and frequently lethal melanocytic neoplasm that can quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Currently, prognosis is determined by measuring tumor thickness but more reliable markers for metastatic spread are urgently needed. We investigated whether the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis can predict melanoma metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). We quantified the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis, as well as other factors, in excised primary tumors and in SLN biopsy samples from 45 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Primary melanomas from patients whose tumors had metastasized to the SLN, along with their metastastic foci, contained prominent hotspots of increased lymphatic vessel density, compared to non-metastatic tumors. Multivariate risk analysis revealed that the lymphatic vascular area (LVA) of primary melanomas, an index of tumor lymphangiogenesis, was the most sensitive prognostic marker for SLN metastasis, and was even able to more accurately predict which tumors would become metastatic to SLN than measuring tumor thickness. The extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis is a highly sensitive (83%) and specific (89%) prognostic marker of lymph node metastasis. Assessment of lymphangiogenesis in primary melanomas may be a more effective approach than measuring tumor thickness in selecting patients with early metastatic disease for aggressive therapy.

AB  - Polypoid lesions arising at ileostomy sites are uncommon and include inflammatory polyps related to prolapse and neoplastic polyps. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is rare and usually occurs in longstanding ulcerative colitis. An 82-year-old woman presented with an erythematous 1.5?cm polyp at the mucocutaneous junction of her ileostomy. Her history is significant for a cystectomy with ileal loop 23 years earlier for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. She had no prior history of ulcerative colitis. Histologically, a polypoid lesion was produced by variable-sized cystic spaces filled with mucin and lined by columnar epithelium with goblet cells. The epithelial cells demonstrated cytological atypia and occasional mitotic figures were observed. Smaller neoplastic glands infiltrated the dermis and scattered, multiple epidermotropic foci were noted. We present an unusual case of a primary mucinous adenocarcinoma with multiple epidermotropic foci arising at an ileostomy site in a patient without a known history of ulcerative colitis. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is a rare occurrence described primarily in the gastrointestinal literature but could easily be unrecognized by a dermatopathologist. Knowledge of this phenomenon may prove helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Metastasis to the breast from extramammary neoplasms is rare. Such metastatic neoplasms can mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma clinically and histologically, presenting a diagnostic challenge. A 50-year-old woman with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma in clinical remission presented with rapid onset unilateral breast swelling with warmth and erythema. Based upon the clinical presentation, an underlying breast carcinoma was suspected. A punch biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive involvement of the dermal lymphatics. The clinical and histologic differential diagnosis included inflammatory carcinoma secondary to a primary breast carcinoma vs. metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast. To resolve this question, immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors and CDX-2 were performed. CDX-2 is an intestinal homeobox gene that is expressed in intestinal epithelium and tumors with intestinal differentiation including esophageal adenocarcinoma. CDX-2 expression has not been reported in breast carcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CDX-2 but negative for both steroid receptors. The diagnosis of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast was confirmed. This case emphasizes the importance of confirming the tumor lineage in inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. CDX-2 can be a useful tool in establishing a gastrointestinal origin of cutaneous metastases.

AB  - Background: Laminin-5 is a basement membrane constituent that functions as an anchoring filament to integrin-derived hemidesmosomes, and has been detected at the invasive front (tumor-stromal interface) in many types of carcinomas. Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

To date, a considerable amount of knowledge about various aspects of this problem has been accumulated, including the ways in which trauma impacts child mental health and development, as well as intervention techniques, and prevention methods. Considering the large populations of civilians that experience the trauma of war, it is timely to review existing literature, summarize approaches for helping war-affected children, and suggest future directions for research and policy.

AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a recessively inherited genodermatosis associated with extreme sun sensitivity, defective repair of several types of sunlight induced adducts in cellular DNA, and numerous, early-onset skin cancers. The dry, rough skin corresponds to progressive cytologic atypia and loss of polarity in the underlying epidermis. Associated with these changes are immune deficiencies against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin cancer. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a DNA synthesis antimetabolite used against several types of cancers. Applied topically in normal subjects it is associated with moderate to severe inflammation in areas where actinic keratoses have arisen followed by ablation of the actinic keratoses which is dependent on the inflammation. We applied 5-FU to the sun-exposed skin of two patients with XP, a 14 year-old light complected black male and a 14 year-old Caucasian female. No inflammation was observed, but marked improvement in the clinical presentation of the skin was seen, as well as an absence of new malignancies. This change was confirmed histopathologically and correlated with normalization of polarity and cytologic changes in the epidermal cells. These histologic findings were quantitated using computerized image analysis. These results may be due to activation of alternative DNA repair pathways in these nucleotide excision repair deficient cells.

AB  - We report six cases of a basaloid neoplasm arising on the head and neck showing immature sebaceous gland and focal immature hair follicle differentiation. Four cases arose in the periorbital area, one on the lower lip, and one on the neck. In all six cases extensive involvement of the surrounding soft tissues was observed. In five cases the tumor involved and was particularly aggressive in bone, requiring extensive resection. In two cases tumor extended to and involved the dura mater of the brain. Three cases required enucleation. Patients ranged in age from 30 to 81 years and consisted of four males and two females. No infection, syndrome, or other predisposing factor was known to be present. No patient was known to be a smoker or to engage in any other risk activity for cancer. No evidence of metastasis was noted in any patient. We conclude that the basaloid neoplasm showing immature pilo-sebaceous differentiation of the head and neck is a distinct entity with a much more aggressive course than basal cell carcinoma and a different progression from that of any other adnexal neoplasm, including sebaceous carcinoma.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin. Methods: A total of 101 melanocytic lesions of the skin including compound nevi (21), intradermal nevi (18), melanoma in situ (3), primary invasive melanoma (30), and metastatic melanoma (29) were evaluated for cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The following tiered system was used for scoring: 0% of cells with nuclear staining (score 0), 1?19% nuclear staining (score 1), 20?49% nuclear staining (score 2), and 50% or greater nuclear staining (score 3). Results: The average score for primary melanomas was significantly higher compared to nevi (p?=?0.0046), and for in situ melanomas compared to primary invasive melanomas (p?=?0.011). There was slightly higher level of expression in compound nevi versus intradermal nevi. Conclusion: Our study indicates that cyclin D1 expression is increased in malignant compared to benign melanocytic lesions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the biological role of cyclin D1 in melanocytic lesions of the skin.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate the clinical behaviour and immunophenotype of lymphoma of the rectum in dogs. Methods Eleven dogs diagnosed with lymphoma of the rectum on histopathology were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemistry with CD3 and CD79a antibodies was performed at diagnosis or retrospectively. Results Treatment protocol varied with six dogs undergoing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, two received chemotherapy after only incisional biopsy, one had surgical resection only, one was treated symptomatically and one dog was not treated. Chemotherapy treatment consisted of either a -low-dose COP (cyclophosphamide - prednisolone - vincristine) protocol (four dogs) or a six-week CHOP-based (cyclophosphamide - vincristine - -prednisolone - anthracycline) protocol (four dogs). Dogs that received chemotherapy lived significantly longer than dogs that did not receive chemotherapy (2352 versus 70 days). Median survival time was not reached, and there was an overall mean survival time of 1697 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 of 11 samples, and was consistent with B-cell -lymphoma in all cases. Clinical Significance Canine lymphoma of the rectum is associated with a favourable prognosis. Immunohistochemical evaluation of these lesions was consistent with B-cell lymphoma in all cases in which it was examined.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the type and prevalence of incidental findings from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the maxillofacial region. Findings are divided into those that require (i) intervention/referral, (ii) monitoring, and (iii) no further evaluation. Methods Three hundred consecutive CBCT scans conducted in the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Clinic from January 1 to August 31, 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Findings were categorized into airway, soft tissue calcifications, bone, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), endodontic, dental developmental, and pathological findings. Results A total of 272 scans revealed 881 incidental findings (3.2 findings/scan). The most prevalent was airway findings (35%) followed by soft tissue calcifications (20%), bone (17.5%), TMJ (15.4%), endodontic (11.3%), dental developmental (0.7%), and pathological (0.1%). 16.1% required intervention/referral, 15.6% required monitoring, and the remainder (68.3%) required neither. Conclusion This study underscores the need to thoroughly examine all CBCT volumes for clinically significant findings within and beyond the region of interest.
