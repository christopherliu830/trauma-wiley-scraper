AB  - We present a case of a sixty-one-year-old Hispanic man with multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Facial papules and nodules appeared around age five, increasing in number with age. Two BCCs were diagnosed and treated elsewhere, one of which prompted enucleation of the left eye and radiation therapy to that area at age fifty. Physical examination showed nodules (0.5 to 2.5?cm in size) on the scalp, face, ears, arms and the upper back. Biopsies from such tumors demonstrated three histological patterns: pure trichoepithelioma, trichoepithelioma with unequivocal BCC, and basaloid neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis. The trichoepithelioma shows the typical pattern: hair papillae, cystic, retiform basaloid cells and abundant stroma. The BCCs, which were often admixed with the trichoepitheliomas, were nodular type with peripheral palisading, stromal retraction, central confluent necrosis and adenoid features. The basaloid neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis showed cords and nests of basaloid cells without follicular differentiation. Immunohistochemically BCC?s areas showed more uniform and stronger staining for BCL-2 than in trichoepithelioma though the latter showed papillary mesenchymal staining. No significant difference was observed for Ber-EP4 and CD34. We conclude this may represent a unique malignant degeneration or a contiguous gene syndrome.

AB  - Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis with cutaneous, skeletal, ocular, neurological, and dental abnormalities. It has been mapped to chromosome Xq28 encoding the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). NEMO regulates many genes, such as those that prevent apoptosis. IP is usually lethal in males. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are able to survive due to one normal X chromosome. We report a case of a male who presented after birth with multiple vesicles in a linear distribution on the calf progressing to persistent hyperpigmentation. At one month of age a punch biopsy showed verrucous hyperplasia with mild hypergranulosis, necrotic dyskeratinocytes and a lichenoid infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils and melanophages. A diagnosis of IP was rendered. No additional physical findings were noted. The patient was evaluated for Klinefelter syndrome. While his karyotype was 46, XY by conventional cytogenetics, a dual color interphase FISH detected 92.5% 46, XY and 6.5% 47, XXY. Our patient?s unique genetic array allowed a mechanism to escape and otherwise fatal disorder. This case illustrates the potential utility of using FISH analysis to detect Klinefelter syndrome in a male patient with IP and normal conventional chromosomal analysis.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - p63, a recently identified homologue of p53 gene, has been reported to be essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms versus adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis using p63 monoclonal antibody (clone 4A4) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 10 malignant adnexal tumors, and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) benign adnexal tumors showed strong p63 expression; the remaining 7(35%) cases had over 50% p63-positive nuclei. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive for p63 (p?<?0.0001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.

AB  - A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with a ten-year history of flushing and facial swelling partially responsive to anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial therapies. Progressive edema of the right upper eyelid was recently treated by blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty specimen had a dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes. The granulomas appeared both peri-and intralymphatic with prominent molding. Special stains and polarization studies were negative. To confirm the intralymphatic location of these granulomas we performed immunohistochemical staining with Factor VIII and D2?40. D2?40 is a new monoclonal antibody that reacts with an O-linked sialoglycoprotein found on lymphatic endothelium, fetal testis, and on the surface of testicular germ cell tumors. In recent studies, clone D2?40 has shown staining in lymphatic channel endothelium but not in adjacent capillary. Factor VIII antibody highlighted both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, while D2?40 stained only the lymphatic endothelium and confirmed the intra-lymphatic location of granulomas. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatous lymphangiitis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal type (orofacial granulomatosis). Granulomatous lymphangiitis is characteristic but not completely diagnostic of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. We present the complex differential diagnosis of intralymphatic granulomas and the use of a new monoclonal antibody helpful in verifying their location.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate the clinical behaviour and immunophenotype of lymphoma of the rectum in dogs. Methods Eleven dogs diagnosed with lymphoma of the rectum on histopathology were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemistry with CD3 and CD79a antibodies was performed at diagnosis or retrospectively. Results Treatment protocol varied with six dogs undergoing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, two received chemotherapy after only incisional biopsy, one had surgical resection only, one was treated symptomatically and one dog was not treated. Chemotherapy treatment consisted of either a -low-dose COP (cyclophosphamide - prednisolone - vincristine) protocol (four dogs) or a six-week CHOP-based (cyclophosphamide - vincristine - -prednisolone - anthracycline) protocol (four dogs). Dogs that received chemotherapy lived significantly longer than dogs that did not receive chemotherapy (2352 versus 70 days). Median survival time was not reached, and there was an overall mean survival time of 1697 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 of 11 samples, and was consistent with B-cell -lymphoma in all cases. Clinical Significance Canine lymphoma of the rectum is associated with a favourable prognosis. Immunohistochemical evaluation of these lesions was consistent with B-cell lymphoma in all cases in which it was examined.

AB  - Summary Background? Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is an inherited skin disorder caused by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) and keratin 14 (KRT14) genes, with fragility of basal keratinocytes leading to epidermal cytolysis and blistering. Objectives? In this study, we characterized mutations in KRT5 and KRT14 genes in patients with EBS and investigated their possible structure?function correlations. Materials and methods? Mutations were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Further, to explore possible correlations with function, the structural effects of the mutations in segment 2B of KRT5 and KRT14 and associated with EBS in our patients, as well as those reported previously, were modelled by molecular dynamics with the aid of the known crystal structure of the analogous segment of human vimentin. Results? We have identified mutations in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes in 16 of 23 families affected by EBS in the Czech Republic. Eleven different sequence variants were found, of which four have not been reported previously. Novel mutations were found in two patients with the EBS-Dowling?Meara variant (EBS-DM) [KRT14-p.Ser128Pro and KRT14-p.Gln374_Leu387dup(14)] and in three patients with localized EBS (KRT14-p.Leu136Pro and KRT5-p.Val143Ala). Molecular dynamics studies show that the mutations p.Glu411del and p.Ile467Thr perturb the secondary alpha-helical structure of the mutated polypeptide chain, the deletion p.Glu411del in KRT14 has a strong but only local influence on the secondary structure of KRT14, and the structural impact of the mutation p.Ile467Thr in KRT5 is spread along the helix to the C-terminus. In all the other point mutations studied, the direct structural impact was significantly weaker and did not destroy the alpha-helical pattern of the secondary protein structure. The changes of 3-D structure of the KRT5/KRT14 dimer induced by the steric structural impact of the single point mutations, and the resulting altered inter- and intramolecular contacts, are spread along the protein helices to the protein C-terminus, but the overall alpha-helical character of the secondary structure is not destroyed and the atomic displacements induced by mutations cause only limited-scale changes of the quaternary structure of the dimer. Conclusions? The results of molecular modelling show relationships between patients? phenotypes and the structural effects of individual mutations.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparisons between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on ultrasonography and control horses. Study design Retrospective descriptive study. Methods Part 1: 19 horses with hindlimb PSD and 10 control horses were humanely destroyed. Twenty control limbs and 37 lame limbs were examined grossly and 40 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically and graded blindly. Part 2: 3 horses with recurrent lameness after surgical management of PSD and 4 with PSD were assessed ultrasonographically and by gross post mortem examination. Results Part 1: ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) lame limbs; in 4/37 (10.8%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem and histological examinations of control limbs revealed no abnormalities. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) lame limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs; muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Part 2: adhesions between the SL and adjacent soft tissues were predicted ultrasonographically and confirmed post mortem. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as the gold standard. Adhesions may be a reason for recurrent lameness after surgery.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

AB  - The histopathologic differential diagnosis of subepidermal blisters is broad and most commonly includes primary dermatologic diseases (i.e. bullous pemphigoid), secondary blistering conditions (i.e. bullous lichen planus), and drug reactions (i.e. toxic epidermal necrolysis); however, when examining blister specimens taken during autopsy, several other entities need to be added to the differential diagnosis. For one year, we biopsied cutaneous blisters and erosions found during autopsies performed at the Dallas County Medical Examiner?s Office and examined them histologically. The objective of this study was to determine the primary cause of blisters and erosions seen at autopsy, characterize them histologically in order to allow differentiation from other blistering conditions, and emphasize causes of subepidermal blisters that are often not considered in the differential diagnosis. We present eight representative cases in order to illustrate the following points. The majority of blisters and erosions examined were subepidermal and secondary to physical causes, such as burns, defibrillation, submersion, fetal maceration, and decomposition. Although primary skin conditions need to be considered when examining blisters and erosions at autopsy, the most common entities are secondary to physical causes, and these need to be included in the differential diagnosis in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Incidence of invasive melanoma is reported to be steadily increasing worldwide. Whether due to an actual increase in disease, or increased surveillance and changes in diagnostic criteria, or both is unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze Clark Level and Breslow thickness trends in a population-based sample over five decades. All cases of invasive melanoma, a total of 200, diagnosed from 1985?1999 were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project that incorporates medical-surgical index information for all residents of Rochester/Olmsted County. These findings updated two previous studies of invasive melanoma from 1950?1985, resulting in 296 total cases over the 1950?1999 period. The incidence of Clark level II lesions increased from 0% in 1950?1959 to 51% in 1990?1999, while Clark level V lesions decreased from 38% to 4%. Moreover, the incidence of lesions with Breslow 4?mm decreased from 25% to 7%. These variations were found to be statistically significant (p?=?<0.01). The decreases in Clark level and Breslow thickness seen in this population-based sample over the last 5 decades suggests that a significant component of increased invasive melanoma incidence may be explained by increased surveillance and earlier detection.

AB  - Sezary syndrome (SS) is a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving the blood, skin and lymph nodes associated with erythroderma. Other cutaneous manifestations of SS include palmoplantar keratoderma, ectropion, and alopecia. Two clinical patterns of SS can be defined: ?secondary? SS arising from systemic spread of long-standing mycosis fungoides (MF) and ?primary? SS with a much shorter prodromal phase characterized by pruritus, xerosis and scaling culminating in erythroderma. Most previous studies examining the histological features of SS have not distinguished between these two different clinical patterns, and have emphasized that the histological features of SS mostly resemble those of typical MF, including epidermotropism and/or band-like superficial dermal lymphoid infiltrates. In this study, we have concentrated on the histological findings of primary SS and correlated them with the clinical and hematologic parameters at the time of skin biopsy. We note that dermal perivascular lymphoid infiltrates predominate in a majority of primary SS cases, raising the differential diagnosis of benign dermatoses, rather than resembling the classical pattern of MF. This impression is further complicated by commonly observed epidermal changes such as spongiosis, acanthosis and parakeratosis that are likely secondary to tumor-associated pruritus and secondary lichenification.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It has been suggested that ultrasonography is unreliable for the detection of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) based on comparison between ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance images. Objectives To compare ultrasonography with gross and histopathological post mortem examination in horses with PSD diagnosed based on the response to local anaesthesia and ultrasonography. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD were humanely destroyed. The ultrasonographic abnormalities were graded prospectively as mild, moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examined grossly and 36 suspensory ligaments (SLs) were examined histologically. The histological images were graded blindly based on predefined criteria (0?3 for each tissue type; 0?=?normal, 3?=?severe abnormality). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were graded moderate in 31/38 (81.6%) and severe in 7/38 (18.4%) limbs; in 4/36 (11.1%) limbs adhesion formation between the proximal aspect of the SL and the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon was predicted. Gross post mortem examination revealed substantial adhesions between the proximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there were adhesions between the body of the SL and the mid plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, extending distally in 6 (16.2%) limbs. Histology revealed abnormalities (grades 1?3) of the collagenous tissue in 25/36 (69.4%) limbs. Muscle was abnormal (grades 1?3) in 35/36 (97.2%) limbs and adipose tissue (grades 1?3) in 16/36 (44.4%) limbs. Neural abnormalities (grades 1?3) were seen in 23/36 (63.9%) limbs and vascular changes (grade 1 and 2) in 2/36 (5.6%) limbs. In 1/36 limbs no abnormality was detected. Conclusions Ultrasonography was reasonably reliable for the detection of SL pathology based on histology as a gold standard, but the ability to detect gross adhesions was limited.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) differs from S. epidermidis isolated from normal flora in terms of its capacity to induce activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1? in human neutrophils. The amount of active caspase-1 was determined over 6 h by detecting Ac-YVAD-AMC fluorescence in human neutrophils incubated with S. epidermidis isolates from PJIs (ST2) or normal flora. The amount of IL-1? was detected by ELISA in neutrophil supernatants after 6 h of incubation. Mean IL-1? release was lower after incubation with S. epidermidis from PJIs compared to isolates from normal flora, but no statistically significant difference was found in active caspase-1. Substantial inter-individual differences in both active caspase-1 and IL-1? were noted. These results suggest that evasion of innate immune response, measured as reduced capacity to induce release of IL-1? from human neutrophils, might be involved in the predominance of ST2 in S. epidermidis PJIs, but that other microbe-related factors are probably also important.

AB  - Mammary-like glands are a poorly recognized structure of the normal vulvar skin. Adenocarcinomas occur rarely in these glands and represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity that must be distinguished from metastatic tumors. We present a case of a 51-year-old patient with a long-standing nodule on her right labium majus. Excision with subsequent Mohs micrographic surgery revealed an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the mammary-like glands involving the dermis and subcutis. We review all cases thus far reported (including the case presented herein) and identify important clinical and morphologic features of this tumor. A significant histopathological and immunohistochemical overlap between this neoplasm, sweat gland carcinomas, and invasive extramammary Paget?s disease was recognized; suggesting the existence of a morphologic spectrum between these entities. Criteria for establishing the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of mammary-like glands are reviewed, including the importance of identifying transition zones between normal mammary-like glands and malignant glands. We believe that this tumor is best categorized as a locally aggressive neoplasm with a low metastatic potential and death from disease is uncommon. The successful treatment of this case by Mohs micrographic surgery suggests that an alternate management approach may be adopted for these tumors, particularly in elderly patients.

AB  - We report a 6-month old male infant who presented to our pediatric dermatology clinic with a generalized bullous eruption since three months of age. A sepsis work up performed prior to presentation did not reveal any evidence of infection. Clinical presentation revealed multiple tense bullae in a ?string of pearls? arrangement and multiple erosions on the bilateral upper extremities and trunk. This clinical presentation was strongly suggestive of chronic bullous disease of childhood. Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal complete blood cell count and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus types I and II was negative. Histological sections demonstrated a large space of separation between the epidermis and dermis which was filled by a monomorphous infiltrate composed of round to oval cells with centrally placed nuclei, consistent with mast cells. Leder and c-kit stains were strongly positive confirming the diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis. Direct immunofluorescence did not reveal IgA deposits or any other findings. Treatment included fluocinonide 0.05% cream QAM and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment QHS to active lesions, and silver sulfadiazine 1% cream to erosions. Improvement was noted during follow up examination.

AB  - Abstract Recent findings indicate that vascular risk factors and neurovascular dysfunction play integral roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to aging, the most common risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are apolipoprotein e4 allele, hypertension, hypotension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. All of these can be characterized by vascular pathology attributed to conditions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and subsequent blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Many epidemiological, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic studies have assessed the associations between such risk factors and Alzheimer's disease and have found positive associations between hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes mellitus. However, there are still many conflicting results from these population-based studies, and they should be interpreted carefully. Recognition of these factors and the mechanisms by which they contribute to Alzheimer's disease will be beneficial in the current treatment regimens for Alzheimer's disease and in the development of future therapies. Here we discuss vascular factors with respect to Alzheimer's disease and dementia and review the factors that give rise to vascular dysfunction and contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Severe keratinocyte dysplasia (SKD) has been reported in the early post-transplant period of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCST) patients, with a frequency as high as 47.4%. In the period less than 3 weeks post-transplant it was associated with cyclophosphamide conditioning. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of SKD in a later post-transplant period, from 28 days to 84 days, and study the possible causes. The 2003 slide file (227 slides) of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance was examined for skin biopsies from patients who had undergone HCST. Twenty-two cases (9.7%) showed SKD. A control group of 22 biopsies matched for days post-transplant and age were selected from the remaining 205 biopsies. SKD was associated with a busulfan conditioning regimen, 72.7% in the SKD group and 36.3% in the control group (p?=?0.016). SKD was not associated with cyclophosphamide (p?=?0.174), fludarabin (p?=?0.263) or total body irradiation (p?=?0.50). Although active GVHD (grade 2 or 3) was more commonly seen in SKD group (45.5%) than the control group (22.2%), it did not show significant difference (p?=?0.052). Our study showed that SKD developed in 9.7% of the skin biopsies from days 28 to 84 post-transplant, and was associated with busulfan conditioning regimen.
