AB  - Abstract Dimemorfan, an antitussive and a sigma-1 (σ1) receptor agonist, has been reported to display neuroprotective properties. We set up an animal model of ischemic stroke injury by inducing cerebral ischemia (for 1?h) followed by reperfusion (for 24?h) (CI/R) in rats to examine the protective effects and action mechanisms of dimemorfan against stroke-induced damage. Treatment with dimemorfan (1.0??g/kg and 10??g/kg, i.v.) either 15?min before ischemia or at the time of reperfusion, like the putative σ1 receptor agonist, PRE084 (10??g/kg, i.v.), ameliorated the size of the infarct zone by 67?72% or 51?52%, respectively, which was reversed by pre-treatment with the selective σ1 receptor antagonist, BD1047 (20??g/kg, i.v.). Major pathological mechanisms leading to CI/R injury including excitotoxicity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis are all downstream events initiated by excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Dimemorfan treatment (10??g/kg, i.v., at the time of reperfusion) inhibited the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1?, which occurred in parallel with decreases in neutrophil infiltration, activation of inflammation-related signals (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-?B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1), expression of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase, oxidative/nitrosative tissue damage (lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and 8-hydroxy-guanine formation), and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex after CI/R injury. Dimemorfan treatment at the time of reperfusion, although did not prevent an early rise of glutamate level, significantly prevented subsequent glutamate accumulation after reperfusion. This inhibitory effect was lasted for more than 4?h and was reversed by pre-treatment with BD1047. These results suggest that dimemorfan activates the σ1 receptor to reduce glutamate accumulation and then suppresses initiation of inflammation-related events and signals as well as induction of oxidative and nitrosative stresses, leading to reductions in tissue damage and cell death. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that dimemorfan exhibits protective effects against ischemic stroke in CI/R rats probably through modulation of σ1 receptor-dependent signals to prevent subsequent glutamate accumulation and its downstream pathologic events.

AB  - Summary The anal canal has a complex anatomy and histology. Multiple different types of mucosa are present within the anal canal, knowledge of which is crucial to understanding tumorigenesis at this site. Within the anal canal, at the dentate line, columnar/colonic type mucosa abuts squamous mucosa, with areas of intervening transitional-type mucosa. At this level anal glands also drain into the anal canal. The lower aspect of the anal canal lies in direct continuity with perianal skin, so not only may the anal canal develop those tumours commonly seen involving either the colorectum or perianal skin, but also a number of additional tumour types may develop that arise from anal squamous or transitional-type mucosa and anal glands.

AB  - Introduction: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a low grade B cell lymphoproliferative disease with overlapping features with small lymphocytic lymphoma. The neoplastic cell is an autoreactive CD5 CD23 B lymphocyte. B-CLL may involve the skin, typically in the context of known disease. We present a case of subclinical B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. Results: A 73-year-old male developed a lesion on his right cheek in April 2003 compatible with basal cell carcinoma. The re-excision specimen contained a well differentiated atypical lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with B-CLL along with residual carcinoma. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed slight thrombocytopenia and mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. A diagnosis was made of stage 0 CLL. Chromosomal studies on peripheral blood showed a deletion at 13q14.3. Conclusion: This case represents a cutaneous presentation of subclinical B-CLL. There are two prior reports describing B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. In one case the infiltrates were incidental on a re-excision specimen. The second report suggests 16% of B-CLL patients have cutaneous manifestations as the first sign of disease. Data indicates that 13q14 deletion in B-CLL in early stage disease may portend a more aggressive course, possibly explaining its early presentation in the skin in our case.

AB  - Summary Age is the single most important risk factor for progressive dementia in populations worldwide. In developed countries the prevalence of dementia is estimated to be 3?5% at age 65 years and expected to double every decade thereafter. Although there is ageing-related attrition of neural tissue accompanied by profound changes in brain glia, marked neuronal loss and severe cognitive impairment are associated with pathological changes. Accelerated somatic ageing of the vasculature comprising endothelial and smooth muscle cells and slowed glial replacement are also likely to pre-dispose to degenerative processes. Approximately 90% of patients with late-onset dementia have neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or vascular dementia (VaD), alone or in combination. Both AD and DLB reveal extensive amyloid ? deposition within senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles evident as tau pathology are much reduced in DLB where symptoms may be more related to cholinergic transmitter abnormalities than structural pathology. Depletion of brain acetylcholine is also encountered in VaD, which like AD and DLB may respond to cholinergic therapy. Cerebrovascular pathology, ischaemic brain damage and neurovascular instability resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion appears fundamental in the pathogenesis of late-onset dementia. The apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, a major genetic susceptibility factor for AD also associated with cardiovascular pathology, may contribute to neurodegenerative changes through vascular mechanisms. The interrelationships of these multiple substrates of late-onset dementia have major implications for neuroprotective and disease slowing therapies. Measures that improve cardiovascular function and increase brain perfusion would be useful to attenuate cognitive decline.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Forceps delivery is associated with a high rate of levator ani muscle (LAM) trauma (avulsion) at 35%-65% whereas data on avulsion rates after vacuum delivery vary greatly. Nevertheless, a common characteristic of all previous studies carried out to evaluate the association between instrumental deliveries (forceps and vacuum) and LAM avulsion, is the fact that characteristics of the instrumentation have not been described or evaluated. The objective of this study is to compare the rate of LAM avulsion between forceps and vacuum deliveries according to the characteristics of the instrumentation. Material and methods Prospective, observational study, including 263 nulliparous women, who underwent an instrumental delivery with either Malmström vacuum or Kielland forceps. The characteristics of the instrumentation, position (anterior position and other position) and height of the fetal head at the moment of instrumentation (low instrumentation [vertex at +2 station] and mid-instrumentation [head is involved but leading part above +2 station]) were assessed. Evaluation of LAM avulsion was performed at 6 months postpartum by three-/four-dimensional transperineal ultrasound. Using the multi-view mode, a complete avulsion was diagnosed when the abnormal muscle insertion was identified in all three central slices, that is, in the plane of minimal hiatal dimensions and the 2.5-mm and 5.0-mm slices cranial to this one. To detect a 30% or 15% difference in the LAM injury rate, with 80% power and 5% α-error, we needed, respectively 42 and 99 women per study group. Results In all, 263 nulliparous individuals have been evaluated (162 vacuum deliveries, 101 forceps deliveries). Instrumentation in an occipito-anterior position was more frequent in vacuum deliveries (75.3% vs 56.4%, P = .002), whereas other positions were more frequent in the forceps deliveries group (24.7% vs 43.6%). No statistically significant differences were noted regarding the height of the fetal head at the moment of instrumentation. No statistically significant differences were found in the presence of LAM avulsion (41.4% vs 38.6%) between vacuum and forceps deliveries. The univariate analysis of the crude odds ratio was 1.17, 95% CI 0.67-1.98, P = .70 for the avulsion of the LAM and the multivariate of the adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI; 0.53-1.55, P = .71. Conclusions We consider that, in our population, LAM avulsion rate should not be a factor taken into account when choosing the type of instrumentation (Malmström vacuum or Kielland forceps) in an operative delivery.

AB  - Lipedematous alopecia is a rare entity of uncertain etiology characterized by a diffusely thickened and boggy scalp, with varying degrees of alopecia. Six of eight cases in the literature have occurred in African American women. Classic histopathologic findings include increased subcutaneous tissue, varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis, and an absence of significant mucin deposition. Herein, we report an additional case of lipedematous alopecia occurring in an African American woman who also demonstrated clinical, historical, and histopathologic findings reminiscent of discoid lupus erythematosus. Explicit observation of such an occurrence has not been made previously, although hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, mild perivascular or periadnexal infiltrates, and fibrosing alopecia have been reported in lipedematous scalp, possibly the residua of other cases with associated discoid lupus-like features. For further comparison, we contrast our case with a second patient with lipedematous scalp, which maintained histological similarities to lipedematous alopecia, but was lacked any significant hair loss. It is possible that some cases lipedematous alopecia may represent an unusual sequela of discoid lupus erythematosus. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of two diseases occurring independently, nor that early changes of lipedematous alopecia might share histopathological and/or clinical findings with discoid lupus erythematosus.

AB  - Sezary syndrome (SS) is a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving the blood, skin and lymph nodes associated with erythroderma. Other cutaneous manifestations of SS include palmoplantar keratoderma, ectropion, and alopecia. Two clinical patterns of SS can be defined: ?secondary? SS arising from systemic spread of long-standing mycosis fungoides (MF) and ?primary? SS with a much shorter prodromal phase characterized by pruritus, xerosis and scaling culminating in erythroderma. Most previous studies examining the histological features of SS have not distinguished between these two different clinical patterns, and have emphasized that the histological features of SS mostly resemble those of typical MF, including epidermotropism and/or band-like superficial dermal lymphoid infiltrates. In this study, we have concentrated on the histological findings of primary SS and correlated them with the clinical and hematologic parameters at the time of skin biopsy. We note that dermal perivascular lymphoid infiltrates predominate in a majority of primary SS cases, raising the differential diagnosis of benign dermatoses, rather than resembling the classical pattern of MF. This impression is further complicated by commonly observed epidermal changes such as spongiosis, acanthosis and parakeratosis that are likely secondary to tumor-associated pruritus and secondary lichenification.

AB  - Abstract Macrophages are ubiquitous in the stromal compartment of tissues under normal physiological conditions and the number of these cells increases markedly with the onset and progression of many pathological states. The mechanisms underlying this response are well described in such conditions as wound healing and malignant tumors, where tissue-specific signals enhance the extravasation of blood monocytes and their subsequent differentiation into macrophages. Recent evidence suggests that macrophages may also be stimulated by microenvironmental factors present in diseased tissues to perform distinct, tissue-specific activities. One such factor, hypoxia (low oxygen tension), results from insufficient vascular perfusion of a given tissue. Various studies have shown that experimental hypoxia alters the morphology, expression of cell surface markers, viability, phagocytosis, metabolic activity, and release of cytokines by macrophages. Here we review the evidence for these macrophage responses to hypoxia, the involvement of co-stimuli, and their implications for the role of macrophages in various disease processes. Because the intracellular mechanisms mediating the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in other cell types have been characterized recently, we discuss their possible involvement in the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in macrophages.

AB  - Dimorphic fungal infections (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis) can occur in immunocompromised and healthy individuals. Cutaneous involvement is often secondary and may be the presenting sign of systemic disease. These ominous infections are frequently clinically indistinct and their prognosis is influenced by their timely diagnosis and treatment. Morphological differentiation between these organisms is not definitive and tissue cultures represent the diagnostic gold standard in current day practice. However, not uncommonly tissue cultures are not obtained and merely represent an afterthought in seemingly unsuspecting cases. Furthermore, when performed, they may take several days to weeks for completion. In situ hybridization (ISH) utilizing oligonucleotide probes directed against fungal ribosomal RNA represents a rapid and accurate assay for the diagnosis of dimorphic fungi in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We present 7 patients in whom ISH both prospecitively and retrospectively confirmed the presence of a cutaneous infection (2 histoplasmosis, 2 blastomycosis, 1 coccidiomycosis, 2 cryptococcosis). In all of the skin sections analyzed, dimorphic fungi were morphologically apparent but not diagnostically discernable. In summary, ISH represents a valuable tool in the prompt diagnosis of cutaneous deep fungal infections.

AB  - We describe a 7-year old male with a 7-month history of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) presenting as an innocuous 0.5???0.5?cm nodule on the nasal dorsum. Following diagnostic sampling, Mohs? micrographic surgery was performed to ensure adequate removal and patient continues to do well 1 year post-surgery. PFT is a rare neoplasm described initially by Enzinger and Zhang in 1988. It afflicts children and young adults (median age: 14.5 years) and has a strong female predisposition. It typically occurs on the upper extremity. Histologically, the tumor has a bland appearance consisting of a biphasic population of varying numbers of fibroblast and histiocyte-like cells. Cellular atypia and pleomorphism are lacking and mitotic activity is low. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally, the tumor demonstrates myofibroblastic differentiation. The constituent cells have a diploid DNA content. Unique cytogenetic aberrations have been anecdotally identified. PFT behaves in a locally aggressive fashion and regional nodal disease can occur despite adequate excision. In rare instances, metastasis to the lungs has been described. No association between specific clinicopathologic features and outcome has been identified. In summary, PFT is a rare but distinct low-grade myofibroblastic tumor of children and young adults with a misleading clinical and histological appearance.

AB  - An 85 year-old woman presented with two pearly papules on her left cheek. The clinical impression was BCC. Biopsy revealed a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes emanating from the epidermis and extending beyond the papillary dermis. A diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered. Excison with frozen section margin control was performed. Permanent sections revealed melanoma, at least 2.06?mm in depth, with melanoma in situ extending to all peripheral margins. Upon re-examination of the initial biopsies, pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia (PEH) with marked squamous atypia was noted. Intimately admixed with the squamous proliferation was a growth of large malignant epithelioid cells. The epitheliod cells lacked pigment production and extended to the shave biopsy margins. This second population of cells was strongly S-100 positive, diagnostic for amelanotic verrucous melanoma. A revised diagnosis of verrucous malignant melanoma, Clark level III, 0.82?mm in depth was rendered. The patient?s course was complicated by multiple positive surgical margins and she ultimately received XRT. This case spotlights the rare occurrence of PEH in conjunction with melanoma. PEH can mask the underlying melanoma and lead to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. As demonstrated, immunostaining is essential in diagnosis of this difficult tumor.

AB  - We report a case of inflammatory stage vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicans (LSA) with histopathologic features simulating both patch stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and extramammary Paget?s disease. The patient is a 79-year-old woman with an erythematous plaque on her vulva. A punch biopsy was performed that revealed mild psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis with spongiosis, marked interface vacuolar alteration, scattered individual necrotic keratinocytes and Civatte bodies. A band-like mixed inflammatory infiltrate was present in the papillary/upper dermis with prominent intraepidermal lymphocytes. Some intraepidermal lymphocytes showed atypical nuclear contours simulating the cells seen in MF. The presence of numerous intraepidermal epithelioid cells with a pagetoid distribution raised the possibility of extramammary Paget?s disease. A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains showed a reactive lichenoid mixed population of lymphocytes with numerous intraepidermal Langerhans cells. This confirmed the diagnosis of the inflammatory stage of lichen sclerosus. The presence of prominent epithelioid Langerhans cells with activated small lymphocytes represents an immune response in LSA and could cause diagnostic confusion with neoplastic conditions. IHC staining can confirm cell type and rule out MF and extramammary Paget?s disease.

AB  - Background: Dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disease syndrome where antibodies to the endothelium of the microvasculature of the skin, muscle and lung are implicated in lesional propagation, is characterized by photodistributed erythema, heliotrope rash, Gottron?s papules, muscle weakness and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Endotheliotropic viruses and underlying neoplasia are among the inciting triggers. Uncommonly drugs, namely the lipid lowering agents, have been implicated in dermatomyositis. Case Report: The patient, a 57-year-old male, developed a photodistributed rash and muscle weakness following treatment with the antifungal medication Lamisil. A skin biopsy was performed, showing an atrophying interface dermatitis with pandermal mucinosis and striking vasculopathic changes including endothelial cell necrosis with denudement and basement membrane zone reduplication. Direct immunofluorescent testing showed prominent staining of C5b-9 along the dermal- epidermal junction and within the vasculature. Conclusion: We have shown a temporal association between use of Lamisil and the development of dermatomyositis. Terbinafine, the active agent in Lamisil, promotes apoptosis of human endothelial cells in culture. Enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis results in the displacement of various cellular antigens creating a state of neo-antigenicity; its attendant sequelae has held to be one of antiendothelial cell antibody formation, a defining pathogenetic event in the evolution of dermatomyositis.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract A boy with metastatic and fatal chondroblastoma is presented. Unlike previously published examples of metastatic chondroblastoma, these metastases developed before any operative manipulation of the primary tumor. The histologic characteristics of the primary, metastatic, and locally recurrent tumors were those of a conventional chondroblastoma. A review of published cases of atypical, aggressive, and malignant chondroblastoma is presented with current follow-up information. Although some metastatic chondroblastomas may result from operative manipulation of the primary tumor and are clinically benign, other histologically benign chondroblastomas exist that are capable of pursuing a malignant course. The authors designate these as malignant chondroblastomas. No histologic criteria exist for the separation of these tumors.

AB  - A 32-year-old immunocompromised African American male on multiple medications with a history of psoriasis and prurigo nodularis presented with a new generalized, painful, pruritic, papular eruption. Histologic sections revealed epidermal changes of lichen simplex chronicus with superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and frequent eosinophils. Two important histological features also identified were eosinophilic panniculitis and prominent perineural eosinophilic infiltrate with focal areas showing eosinophils extending into the substance of the nerve. A right thigh sample was also sent for Gram stain, AFB and fungal cultures, all of which were negative. Laboratory findings at this time were significant for a peripheral blood eosinophilia. The patients? topical corticosteroid prescription was increased with minimal relief. Hypereosinophilic syndrome with dermatoses in HIV infected patients is well documented. We present a patient with advanced AIDS, generalized painful, pruritic, papular rash and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The pattern of inflammation on HIV dermatoses seen in our patient not previously described in the literature is the perineural eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic panniculitis. We propose two possible explanations for these histological findings: (1) hypereosinophilic syndrome in AIDS patients is a heterogeneous disorder and may include eosinophilic neuritis with panniculitis, or (2) an exuberant drug reaction.

AB  - Abstract Aims To report a study of the negotiation practices of neurorehabilitation nurses with one another and with allied health professionals to understand nursing relations. Background Negotiated order theory offers a promising theoretical lens with which to explore negotiation between nurses and other professionals. This study is the first to apply the perspective to nurse?nurse and nurse?allied health professional relations. Design The study is a secondary analysis of findings from a multi-site arts-based intervention to improve patient-centred neurorehabilitation practice. Methods Interviews and ethnographic observations were conducted (2008?2011) in two neurorehabilitation units in Ontario, Canada. Participants (n = 31) included registered and practical nurses, nurse leaders, and allied health professionals from physical, occupational, and recreational therapy, speech language pathology, and social work. Findings Neurorehabilitation nursing is characterized by heavy workload, high patient acuity, and poor interprofessional collaboration. This practice context was negotiated by nurses through two strategies: (1) intraprofessional collegialism, accomplished through tactics including task and knowledge sharing, emotional support, coercive threats, and suppression of dissension; and (2) vying for an autonomous essential nursing role in interprofessional practice, accomplished by claiming unique nursing knowledge based on 24/7 nursing proximity, the expansion of the division of professional labour with allied health professionals and modifying physical therapy care plans. Conclusion The intraprofessional context and negotiations therein were linked in significant ways to interprofessional negotiations. Understanding this complexity has important implications for improving patient safety and interprofessional practice interventions.
