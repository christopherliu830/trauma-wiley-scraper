AB  - A 32-year-old immunocompromised African American male on multiple medications with a history of psoriasis and prurigo nodularis presented with a new generalized, painful, pruritic, papular eruption. Histologic sections revealed epidermal changes of lichen simplex chronicus with superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and frequent eosinophils. Two important histological features also identified were eosinophilic panniculitis and prominent perineural eosinophilic infiltrate with focal areas showing eosinophils extending into the substance of the nerve. A right thigh sample was also sent for Gram stain, AFB and fungal cultures, all of which were negative. Laboratory findings at this time were significant for a peripheral blood eosinophilia. The patients? topical corticosteroid prescription was increased with minimal relief. Hypereosinophilic syndrome with dermatoses in HIV infected patients is well documented. We present a patient with advanced AIDS, generalized painful, pruritic, papular rash and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The pattern of inflammation on HIV dermatoses seen in our patient not previously described in the literature is the perineural eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic panniculitis. We propose two possible explanations for these histological findings: (1) hypereosinophilic syndrome in AIDS patients is a heterogeneous disorder and may include eosinophilic neuritis with panniculitis, or (2) an exuberant drug reaction.

AB  - Objective To describe a large population of dogs with a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism at the time of death in North American veterinary teaching hospitals, and to identify comorbid conditions associated with hyperadrenocorticism. Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort study of 1519 dogs with hyperadrenocorticism from a population of 70,574 dogs reported to the Veterinary Medical Database. Signalment, presence or absence of hyperadrenocorticism, aetiology of hyperadrenocorticism (if described), frequency of select comorbidities and causes of death were evaluated in dogs with and without hyperadrenocorticism. Results Hyperadrenocorticism was more frequent in females. Neutering was associated with a minor, but significant, increase in the odds of hyperadrenocorticism. Hyperadrenocorticism was the presumed cause of death of 393 (25∙9%) of affected dogs. When aetiology was specified (527 dogs, corresponding to 34∙7% of the cases), pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism [387 (73∙4%) out of 527 dogs] was more common than functional adrenocortical tumour [136 (25∙8%) out of 527 dogs). Hyperadrenocorticism was over-represented in certain expected (miniature poodle, dachshund) and unexpected (Irish setter, bassett hound) breeds compared with the population at large. Of the select comorbidities investigated, dogs with hyperadrenocorticism were at increased risk for concurrent diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, hypertension, gall bladder mucocoele and thromboembolic disease compared with dogs without hyperadrenocorticism. Clinical Significance Hyperadrenocorticism is significantly associated with certain comorbid conditions but is not a major cause of mortality in affected dogs. Documented patterns now provide targets for prospective clinical research.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - We report a 48-year-old male who presented with ulcerated plaques and nodules of the lower extremities. Skin biopsies revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate involving the dermis and the subcutis in a lobular and septal pattern. No overt cytological atypia was present. Notably, several features resembling lupus erythematosus were present, including vacuolar interface change and abundant dermal mucin deposition. The patient developed pulmonary nodules, and a lung biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate without overt atypia. The cutaneous and pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates showed similar immunohistochemical profiles: CD3+CD4?CD8+/?CD56+. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma gene with similar migration patterns were identified from both locations. The patient developed fatal hemophagocytic syndrome, involving liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This case is amongst rare reports of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) with systemic involvement.

AB  - Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are experiencing significant declines across the northern part of their range. However, unbiased, population-level estimates of mortality are rarely reported, as it's difficult to quantify causes of mortality robustly in this cryptic species. We aimed to determine the relative importance of carpet python (Morelia spilota) predation in a free-living koala population and describe the characteristic pathological findings during necropsy. In total, 503 koalas were captured, underwent veterinary examination and telemetric tagging, and were monitored after release over a four-year period. Mortalities were detected when activity data reported by K-Tracker? biotelemetry collars indicated low or zero activity, or during routine field monitoring events. Experienced koala veterinarians performed thorough, standardised necropsy examinations on retrieved carcasses to determine causes of death. The three, sometimes subtle, cardinal signs used to definitively diagnose carpet python-caused deaths of koalas were a U-shaped primary bite site, slicking of the fur by python saliva (particularly around the face), and diffuse, uniform pulmonary congestion. We found that carpet pythons were important predators of koalas, second only to wild dogs (dingoes and dingo hybrids (Canis familiaris dingo)), accounting for 11.6% of predation deaths and 7.2% of total deaths. Less than half (38%) of the koalas killed by carpet pythons were ingested. Though carpet pythons are known predators of koalas, their relative importance as a cause of mortality hasn't previously been recognised. Population viability analyses and conservation management plans benefit from robust cause-of-death data collected during longitudinal monitoring studies, requiring telemetry methods that facilitate rapid detection of mortalities.

AB  - Abstract In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of combined chlorine-35, sodium-23 and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4?Tesla, and present the first in vivo chlorine-35 images obtained by means of MRI. With the experimental setup used in this study all measurements could be done in one session without changing the setup or moving the subject. The multinuclear measurement requires a total measurement time of 2?h and provides morphological (protons) and physiological (sodium-23, chlorine-35) information in one scanning session. Chlorine-35, sodium-23 and high resolution proton images were acquired from a phantom, a healthy rat and from a rat displaying a focal cerebral infarction. Compared to the healthy tissue a signal enhancement of a factor of 2.2?±?0.2 in the chlorine-35 and a factor of 2.9?±?0.6 in the sodium-23 images is observed in the areas of infarction. Exemplary unlocalized measurement of the in vivo longitudinal and transversal relaxation time of chlorine-35 in a healthy rat showed multi-exponential behaviour. A biexponential fit revealed a fast and a slow relaxing component with T1,a?=?(1.7?±?0.4) ms, T1,b?=?(25.1?±?1.4) ms, amplitudes of A?=?0.26?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.74?±?0.02 and T2,a?=?(1.3?±?0.1) ms, T2,b?=?(11.8?±?1.1) ms, A?=?0.64?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.36?±?0.02. Combined proton, sodium-23 and chlorine-35 MRI may provide a new approach for non-invasive studies of ionic regulatory processes under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo.

AB  - Objective Laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle alone may not be sufficient in all patients to characterize or prove a recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) lesion in cases of vocal fold immobility. LEMG of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle may provide additional information. Study Design Retrospective review. Method Between 2008 and 2016, 339 patients in our laryngeal paralysis clinic were examined by transcutaneous needle TA-LEMG and, if tolerated, by PCA-LEMG. LEMGs were rated and compared according to criteria of the European Laryngological Society. Etiology was categorized as iatrogenic, noniatrogenic, or malignancy related. Results A total of 282 out of 339 patients had a partial or complete RLN or vagal nerve lesion: 178 iatrogenic, 74 noniatrogenic, and 30 because of nerve involvement by malignancies. Of paralytic vocal folds, 35.7% had normal or near-normal TA innervation, whereas corresponding PCA traces (if present) were pathologic in 94.6%. Comparing pairs of TA and PCA-LEMGs in paralysis of less than 4 months duration showed a predominance of PCA branch injuries in iatrogenic lesions (71.7 %), while in noniatrogenic lesions this was less pronounced (44.4%). In the few malignancy cases, there was an almost even distribution. Synkinetic reinnervation was earlier in iatrogenic RLN lesions. Conclusion PCA-LEMG was better in proving an RLN lesion than TA-EMG alone. Our findings suggest etiology-dependent differences in the TA/PCA lesion pattern. To confirm this, larger sample sizes are needed. A preferential damage to PCA innervation in iatrogenic lesions could be relevant for further improvements of intraoperative neuromonitoring.

AB  - Spitzoid melanoma in children is a rare tumor that can mimic Spitz nevus both clinically and histologically. Recently, dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway was reported in 89% of sporadic melanomas due to activating mutations in the BRAF or NRAS gene. BRAF mutations are found in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi, whereas none are present in Spitz nevi. NRAS mutations occur in 5?37% of melanomas and 9?56% of common melanocytic nevi. The mutational status of NRAS in Spitz nevi is unknown. This is the first study analyzing the mutational profile of BRAF and NRAS in Spitzoid melanomas occurring in prepubertal children (10 years of age or younger). Primary tumor cells were isolated via laser capture microdissection from 10 typical Spitz nevi and 10 metastatic Spitzoid melanomas. Exons 11 and 15 of BRAF and exons 2 and 3 of NRAS were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Common activating mutations were not identified in BRAF or NRAS. Absence of the V599E hot-spot mutation in BRAF was further confirmed by allele-specific PCR. We conclude that Spitzoid melanomas in children share clinical, histological and genetic similarities to Spitz nevi, and are genetically distinct from other melanoma subtypes.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the genomic alterations that occur in malignant cells, the immune system is increasingly appreciated as a critical axis that regulates the rise of neoplasms and the development of primary tumours and metastases. The interaction between inflammatory cell infiltrates and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment is complex, with inflammation playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes that act as key signalling hubs of the innate immune system. They respond to cellular stress and trauma by promoting activation of caspase-1, a protease that induces a pro-inflammatory cell death mode termed pyroptosis along with the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18. Here, we will briefly introduce inflammasome biology with a focus on the dual roles of inflammasome-produced cytokines in cancer development. Despite emerging insight that inflammasomes may promote and suppress cancer development according to the tumour stage and the tumour microenvironment, much remains to be uncovered. Further exploration of inflammasome biology in tumorigenesis should enable the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer patients.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are proteins that may play importants roles in survival, proliferation and progression to metastasis in several tumors, including melanoma. There is little information on the expression pattern of the phosphorylated (i.e. activated) forms of such kinases in melanoma and their impact on overall survival (OS). We sought to determine the expression, by immunohistochemistry, of phosphorylated MAP kinase (pMAPK), Akt (pAkt) and C-kit (pCkit) in primary and metastatic melanoma, and their correlation with OS. Fifteen patients with Stage III and Stage IV (metastatic melanoma) disease were randomly selected from the UT MD Anderson database. Expression was rated by two investigators on intensity (negative, weak, moderate, and strong) and proportion of reactive tumor cells (0?=?<5%, 1?=?5?25%, 2?=?>25?75%, 3?=?>75%). Eleven of the 15 tumors (primary and/or metatasis) exhibited pMAPK expression (73%). Corresponding percentages were 100% for pAKT and <50%(7/15) for pCkit. OS ranged from less than one year to 9 years. However, there was no correlation between OS and expression of any of these markers.

AB  - Texts and atlases have limitations when used to teach dermatopathology to trainees: they can be tedious and time-consuming to use, image detail is limited, text and figure legends can be ambiguous, and only a minor degree of image annotation (letters, arrows, lines outlining important features) is possible. A video screen recording software program (Camtasia Studio) has been used to create high quality digital audio and video dermatopathology tutorials. The screen recording program is started with the image window being recorded. Audio narration (USB digital microphone) is recorded along with live drawings of annotating lines outlining important histologic features, creating the effect of a ?digital chalkboard? being used by the instructor. Separate clips of each ?chalkboard annotation? with accompanying narration can be combined to create a seamless movie detailing each of the important histopathologic features leading to a specific dermatopathologic diagnosis. Video dermatopathology tutorials are extremely effective because they closely mimic instruction at the microscope. However, they offer the significant advantage of allowing remote teaching at any time or place convenient for the learner. Tutorials can be compressed into a variety of multimedia formats and streamed for web delivery or can be provided on CD for distribution.

AB  - Abstract Objective To estimate the prevalence of complications and describe the outcome associated with calcaneal fractures in non-racing dogs and in cats. Study Design Retrospective multicenter clinical cohort study. Animals Medical records of client-owned dogs and cats (2004?2013). Methods Medical records were searched and 50 animals with calcaneal fractures were included for analysis. Complications were recorded and an outcome score applied to each fracture. Associations between putative risk factors and both major complications, and final outcome scores were explored. Results Complications occurred in 27/50 fractures (61%) including 23 major and 4 minor complications. At final follow-up, 4 animals (10%) were sound, 27 (64%) had either intermittent or consistent mild weight-bearing lameness, 7 (17%) had moderate weight-bearing lameness, and 1 (2%) had severe weight-bearing lameness. Fractures managed using plates and screws had a lower risk of complications than fractures managed using pin and tension band wire, lag or positional screws or a combination of these techniques (Relative risk 0.16, 95% CI 0.02?1.02, P=.052). Non-sighthounds had reduced odds of a poorer outcome score than sighthounds (Odds ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.02?0.50, P=.005) and fractures with major complications had 13 times the odds of a poorer outcome score (Odds ratio 13.4, 95% CI 3.6?59.5, P<.001). Conclusion This study reports a high occurrence of complications associated with calcaneal fracture stabilization in non-racing dogs and in cats, and a poorer outcome score was more likely in animals with complications. A more guarded prognosis should be given to owners of non-racing dogs or cats with calcaneal fractures than previously applied to racing Greyhounds with calcaneal fractures.

AB  - An 11-year-old adopted male presented with deforming scalp and bilateral posterior auricular nodules, joint contractures, and gingival hypertrophy. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodules revealed a normal epidermis with areas of extracellular eosinophilic ground substance surrounding benign spindle-shaped (myo)fibroblasts in the dermis and subcutis, alternating with hyalinized, acellular zones. The spindle cells did not show cytologic atypia. A diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) was given. The patient had been seen multiple times in the past for similar recurring, disfiguring dermal and subcutaneous nodules. The patient had a history of osteolytic lesions of the distal radius and ulna and hyaline deposition involving the sigmoid colon and rectum. JHF is a rare autosomal recessive hyalinosis with mutations of the Capillary Morphogenesis Gene-2 (CMG-2) at chromosome 4q21, a region that encodes a binding protein that concatenates capillary collagen IV to laminin. Other genetic abnormalities include mutations in dermal collagen (types I and III). Disease onset occurs early in life. Organ involvement is an ominous sign usually resulting in death during infancy or early childhood. Surgery is the only presently available treatment.

AB  - Abstract Lipid distribution in the brain is important for many biological functions and has been associated with some brain diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate lipid distribution in different regions of brain tissue in mice. To this end, substantia nigra (SN), caudate putamen (CPu), hippocampus (Hip), hypothalamus (Hyp), and cortex (Cx) tissues of mice were analyzed using direct infusion nanoelectrospray-ion trap mass spectrometry and multivariate analyses. The SN, CPu, Hip, Hyp, and Cx groups showed clear differences in lipid distribution using principal component analysis and a partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plot, and lipid levels were significantly different in different brain regions. In particular, sulfatides were mainly distributed in the SN region. Our results could be used to help understand the functions and mechanisms of lipids in various brain diseases.

AB  - Spectral Imaging Microscopy (SIM) is a technique for performing image-enabled spectroscopic analysis using a standard light microscope. We employed a prototype to a current, commercially available, spectral imaging system (NuanceTM, CRI, Inc.) that electro-optically selects narrow bands of light to be collected by a cooled, monochrome CCD camera. For each sample, images were taken every 10?nm from 420?nm to 720?nm to create a spectral image ?stack.? Analysis of the images with a prototype to the Nuance TM Analyze software (CRI, Inc.) gave both standard color (RGB) and spectral information at each pixel of the images. A representative 40x field was spectrally imaged from H&E slides of 104 biopsy specimens of mycosis fungoides (MF). Optical densities and spectral properties of small lymphocytes were determined. Hyperchromatic cells were pseudocolored to show their distribution. In addition to the important architectural features of MF, SIM can define whether hyperchromatic or normochromatic small lymphocytes are epidermotropic in the lesion by setting appropriate threshold values. Hyperchromasia can be attributed to increased nuclear eosinophilia or basophilia. These differences are difficult to estimate by eye. Since lymphoblasts have enlarged nuclei with dispersed chromatin, a combination of spectral and spatial data is required for their analysis.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.
