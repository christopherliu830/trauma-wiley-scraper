AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the clinical characteristics, perioperative complications, and outcomes in dogs surgically treated for gastric carcinoma. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Forty client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed gastric carcinoma. Methods Medical records were reviewed for preoperative diagnostics, surgery, histopathology, postoperative complications, adjuvant chemotherapy, disease progression, and survival. Variables were assessed for associations with outcome by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Surgical treatment included partial gastrectomy (28 dogs), Billroth I (9 dogs), subtotal gastrectomy (2 dogs), and submucosal resection (1 dog). Major postoperative complications occurred in 8 of 40 dogs, including septic peritonitis secondary to dehiscence in 4 dogs. The median progression free interval was 54?days, and the median survival time (MST) was 178?days (range, 1?1902). According to multivariable analysis results, experiencing an intraoperative complication was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.1?9.8, P = .005), and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with an improved survival (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2?0.9, P = .03). Conclusion In this population of dogs, MST exceeded historically reported data, major postoperative complication rates were comparable to established literature, and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival. Clinical significance Results from this study may be used to counsel owners more accurately regarding prognosis for dogs undergoing surgical excision for gastric carcinoma.

AB  - A 52-year-old male with Crohn?s disease presented with florid pustulosis of the face and trunk. Six months prior to presentation, he received amphotericin for pulmonary aspergillosis. Amphotericin was discontinued after five months due to toxicity, and pharmacotherapy was changed to voriconazole. After four weeks of voriconazole, the acneiform eruption occurred which prompted referral to dermatology. Physical examination revealed innumerable 0.5?cm?1.5?cm pustules, cysts, and inflammatory papules concentrated predominantly over the central face, ears, and conjunctiva, but also involving the chest, shoulders, and back. The clinical differential diagnosis included suppurative folliculitis, papulonecrotic tuberculid, cutaneous Crohn?s disease, acne fulminans, and pustular drug eruption. Multiple biopsies demonstrated diffuse neutrophilic and granulomatous dermal inflammation in a predominantly follicular and perifollicular distribution. Microorganisms were not identified by either histology or culture. The histologic differential diagnosis included cutaneous Crohn?s disease and pustular drug eruption. Voriconazole was discontinued with gradual clearing of the skin lesions. Three months later, worsening of the pulmonary disease necessitated restarting voriconazole. A recurrent pustular eruption, similar to the original eruption, occurred within weeks and subsequently cleared upon discontinuation of voriconazole. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of a voriconazole induced pustular drug eruption.

AB  - Cutaneous adnexal tumors manifesting divergent differentiation are a rare but recognized subset of adnexal neoplasms. We present a 42-year-old woman with a cystic tumor of the skin above the left eyebrow. A biopsy revealed a tumor comprising eccrine tubules lined by a single row of columnar epithelium surrounded by a peripheral small cuboidal layer and containing, adhered to the internal cuticle, mucin-like material. In some areas, the eccrine tubules were associated with sheets of small plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells embedded in a chondroid matrix. Elsewhere, there were cysts containing central keratinous debris associated with a peripheral basaloid epithelial proliferation showing the formation of buds mimicking abortive hair follicle structures. No polarizable terminal or vellus hairs were seen. These two elements were geographically separate in the biopsy but collided in the center of the tissue element. A diagnosis of benign cutaneous mixed tumor with combined folliculosebaceous and eccrine differentiation was rendered. Such tumors present a diagnostic challenge and are frequently confused with neoplasms including the benign mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) and a variety of eccrine and folliculosebaceous neoplasms and harmatomata. This case illustrates the potential multilineage differentiation of pluripoential germinative cells of the cutaneous adnexae.

AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - Histopathological and immune-histochemical studies were carried out in four cases with multiple lacunes of the central grey matter and in control cases without such lesions. Routine light microscopic techniques were applied on paraffin-embedded material to identify lesions that may represent developing lacunes. In addition, polyclonal antisera to human albumin, IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were chosen as markers for extravasated plasma proteins. The brain tissue between lacunes contained several forms of focal injuries which may represent precursors of lacunes. Such lesions included foci of status spongiosus and status cribrosus, regions with dilated extracellular spaces and astrocytic gliosis, and multi-locular cysts. These ?lacune-associated lesions? often included albumin immune-reactivity in extracellular spaces, nerve cell bodies and astrocytes. Less frequently signs of extravasated IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were identified. Thus, lacunes of the human brain frequently showed signs of antigenic sites to albumin. The extracellular deposits probably represent extravasated material from the blood. Vasogenic and cytotoxic oedema combined with other factors probably play important roles during the formation of some of the lacunes.

AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma of the vulva (MMV) accounts for 2% of all melanomas in women with 5-year survival rate of 47%. Lymph node involvement predicts survival in these patients. Ki-67 expression has been correlated with lymph node status in cutaneous melanomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Ki-67 correlates with lymph node metastasis in MMV. Methods: Histomorphology and clinical information of 25?MMV were reviewed. The database was divided in MMV with metastasis (M+) and without lymph node metastasis (M-). A MMV subset was stained for Ki-67 and scored as a percentage (7 patients M+ and 9 patients M-). Results: The age range was 36?88 years-old (mean 63 years-old). The tumor thickness mean was 3.14?mm. The mean Ki-67 expression was 23% for M- and 42.5% for M+(p?=?0.07). Correlation of tumor thickness and Ki-67 expression also has a p value of 0.07. Logistic regression analysis was obtained.Conclusions: This study shows that Ki-67 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in MMV. However, when Ki-67 expression is compared to a classic prognostic indicator such as tumor thickness, it appears to have little or no additional predictive value. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

AB  - Nuclear details are sufficient to differentiate tumors of many types as evidenced by the widespread and successful use of cytology. While cytology examinations are generally optimized to identify the nuclear and morphological characteristics of cell preparations and aspirates, tissue samples are optimized to emphasize the cellular details. Recent studies have validated fractal morphometry for nuclear analysis in cytology. We evaluated the use of nuclear detail analysis employing fractal morphometric analysis in cutaneous tumors to differentiate common and uncommon skin tumors.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder characterised by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. Skin lesions show distinctive thickened, fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. PXE-like fibers have not been described in patients without PXE. We describe 12 patients without known PXE who demonstrated the incidental finding of small numbers of PXE-like fibers in association with the following conditions: lipodermatosclerosis, granulomatous dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, morphea profunda, erythema nodosum, septal panniculitis, basal cell carcinoma and fibrosing dermatitis NOS. The biopsies were almost exclusively from the lower extremities of elderly women (mean age 73.8). The affected gene in PXE has been recently described as ABCC6 which codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. The c.3421C>T mutation has been associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease. We describe a novel assay for this genotype employing real-time PCR of paraffin embedded skin biopsies. Four patients with PXE-like fibers were tested in this fashion and did not carry this mutation. Our series demonstrates that light microscopic findings associated with PXE are not specific, as PXE-like fibers can be observed in patients without clinical or genetic evidence of the disease.

AB  - Over the last 50 years, the significance of the immune system in the development and control of cancer has been much debated. However, recent discoveries provide evidence for a role of immunological mechanisms in the detection and destruction of cancer cells. Forty years ago veterinary oncologists were already investigating the feasibility of treating neoplasia by enhancing anticancer immunity. Unfortunately, this research was hindered by lack of a detailed understanding of cancer immunology, this limited the specificity and success of these early approaches. The great forward strides made in our understanding of onco-immunology in recent years have provided the impetus for a resurgence of interest in anticancer immunotherapy for canine patients. In this article both these initial trials and the exciting novel immunotherapeutics currently in development are reviewed.

The genital system, sperm density, endocrinological profile and karyotype were normal. It is postulated that abundance of the above-noted type of sperm pathology in the human semen might not necessarily be associated with oligozoospermia or fertility impairment. Hohes Ausmaß von Doppelkopf- und Doppelschwanz-Spermatozoen im Sperma eines Mannes. Fallbericht Zusammenfassung:?

Der Genitalbefund, die Spermatozoendichte, das endokrinologische Profil und der Karyotyp waren normal. Es wird festgestellt, daß das übermäßige Auftreten der ge-nannten Spermatozoen-Abnormitäten im Ejakulat nicht unbedingt mit einer Oligozoosper-mie oder einer Beeinträchtigung der Fertilität verbunden sein muß.

AB  - Purpose: About 10% to 20 % of patients with epilepsy have medically intractable seizures. In some patients, the intractable course may be interrupted by seizure-free periods. Transient remission was reported in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), but few studies have examined this phenomenon in detail. We retrospectively reviewed 99 patients with intractable cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsy and studied the clinical features of those with transient remission lasting for >2 years. Methods: We investigated 99 patients with cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsies who were treated in Nagoya University Hospital for >5 years and had medically intractable seizures. The underlying diseases of these 99 patients consisted of mesial tem- poral sclerosis (13 patients), tuberous sclerosis (9), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (9). central nervous system infection (7), iieuronal migration disorder (7), cerebrovascular disease (4), and periventricular leukomalacia (1). No underlying disease was determined in the remaining 49 patients. The epileptic focus was located in the temporal lobe in 37 patients, frontal lobe in 29, occipital lobe in 5, parietal lobe in 2, and was not determined in the remaining 26. The age of onset ranged from 0 month to 14 years (mean 4 years and 3 months). The duration of follow-up ranged from 5 to 33 years (mean 15 years). The age at the last visit ranged from 9 to 34 years (mean 21 years). Eight (8%)patients had a family history of febrile convulsions, and 13 (I 3%) had a family history of epilepsy. Forty-nine (50%) patients had mental deficits. Result: Among 99 patients with intractable cryptogenic or symptomatic localization-related epilepsies of childhood onset, 10 (10%) patients had transient remission that lasted for 2 years or more. The underlying diseases of these 10 patients consisted of mesial temporal sclerosis (3 patients), tuberous sclerosis (1), cortical dysplasia (I), intracranial hemorrhage (1), head trauma (1), and porencephalic cyst (1). No underlying disease was determined in the remaining 2 patients. The epileptic focus was located in the temporal lobe in 5 patients, frontal lobe in 2, and was not determined in the remaining 3 patients. Transient remission occurred within a few months after initiation of medical treatment if an appropriate anticonvulsant was given and lasted for 28 to 99 months. Epileptiforin discharges on the EEG disappeared in 7 patients during transient remission, and reappeared in 5 after recurrence of intractable seizures. Two (20%) patients had mental deficits, and 5 (50%) had a family history of epilepsy. Among 89 patients without transient remission, 57 (64%) patients had mental deficits, and 8 (9%) had a family history of epilepsy. Conclusions: Transient remission in intractable localization-related epilepsy occurs in a variety of pathological conditions and may reflect the progressive nature of some types of epileptic foci.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a small round cell tumor which does not characteristically stain with S-100 protein. We report a case of an 83 year-old male with a two-month history of an ulcerated nodule on the right arm. Histopathology revealed small blue round cells arrayed in a trabecular pattern and in diffuse sheets, with scattered mitoses and necrosis. The cells were negative for vimentin, positive for NSE, focally positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins and diffusely positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins, including CK20. The findings were diagnostic of MCC, however, foci of S-100 protein positive cells were also present in the tumor. Upon reviewing cases from Skin Pathology Laboratory at BUSM received between 1/1/2000 to 7/30/2004, we documented a total of 34 cases diagnosed as MCC; 24 were stained with S-100 protein and this case was the only one that stained positively. S-100 protein positivity of MCC, while having been previously reported, is an uncommon finding. We report our case to stress the importance of morphological and immunoperioxidase features for the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, particularly in the exceptional cases which exhibit S-100 protein positivity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Numbers of corpora amylacea (CA) were observed among 1407 autopsied and/or biopsied cases where diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed clinically and in those where the diabetes mellitus did not exist. A comparative examination was carried out by a semi-quantitative method which revealed a significant difference in the incidence of CA between 100 diabetic and 100 non-diabetic cases. However, there was not a significant difference in the incidence of CA between the diabetic and ischemic cases who have also shown a tendency for developing CA. The results were evaluated statistically by homogeneity examination. Diabetes may enhance the tendency for forming CA by the hyperglycemia increasing the quantity of unused carbohydrate polymers, which are the main components of CA. Changes in the metabolism of glucose by astrocytes caused by aging or by some pathological processes may play a primary role in the developing of CA. Other factors such as the greater volume of cerebrospinal fluid, barrier disturbances and pathological changes which are associated with the appearance of heat stroke protein positivity in CA, also have a prominent role in this type of astrocytic degeneration. The presence of CA does not have any pathognostic significance but some conditions favor its development. A theory is also suggested for the formation of CA similar to other types of biocrystalloids in the central nervous system.

AB  - Objective To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (?ear cleaners?) against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections. Methods Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test. Results Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. Clinical Significance Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.

AB  - A 34-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-c) and idarubicin. Seven days later, while on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, she simultaneously developed fever coupled with painful, pruritic, and erythematous plaques on the face, neck, and chest along with marked edema and erythema of both palms and one sole. With negative blood cultures and a skin biopsy showing epithelial cell vacuolar degeneration and neutrophilic infiltrates surrounding eccrine gland coils, a diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) was rendered. Treatment with oral dapsone rapidly cleared the eruption. During her first consolidation with Ara-C and idarubicin four weeks later, a similar febrile cutaneous eruption occurred and again dapsone therapy led to resolution. For subsequent consolidation courses, pre-medication with dapsone was instituted and the patient remained eruption-free. NEH is a rare and often misdiagnosed disorder. Multiple chemotherapy medications have been implicated as etiologic agents including Ara-c, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, bleomycin, and mitoxantrone. Current oncologic induction-consolidation protocols carry the potential for recurrent NEH in predisposed patients. As this is only the second report of prophylactic dapsone therapy for NEH, further investigation into this topic is warranted.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting
