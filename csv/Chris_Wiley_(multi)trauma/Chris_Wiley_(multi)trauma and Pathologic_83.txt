AB  - Abstract Aims Knowledge of the distribution of the innervation zones (IZs) of the external anal sphincter (EAS) may be useful for preventing anal sphincter incompetence during vaginal delivery. A method proposed for the automatic estimation of the distribution of IZs of EAS from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) was evaluated for repeatability in continent volunteers. Methods In 13 healthy female subjects (age: 35?±?11 years) surface EMG signals were acquired using an anal probe with three circumferential electrode arrays (of 16 contacts each) at different depths within the anal canal (15?mm distance between the centers of adjacent arrays), during four independent experimental sessions. Three maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of 10?sec were performed for each session for a total of 12 contractions per subject. Repeatability of the estimation of the distribution of IZ was tested by evaluating the coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) between the IZ distributions estimated from the signals recorded from each subject. Results A high repeatability (CMC?>?0.8) was found comparing IZ distributions estimated from signals recorded by each array within the same session. A slightly lower value was obtained considering signals recorded during different sessions (CMC?>?0.7), but a higher value (CMC?>?0.8) was obtained after aligning the estimated IZ distributions. The realignment compensates for the operator's error in repositioning the probe in the same position during different sessions. Conclusion This result justifies clinical studies using high-density surface EMG in routine examinations, providing information about IZs of EAS and assessing the possibilities of preventing neuronal trauma during vaginal delivery.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - The spectrum of melanocytic proliferations ranges from banal to overtly malignant. Borderline melanocytic lesions which bridge these two extremes pose a challenge, as their biological nature remains undefined. We set out to evaluate the utility of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in such lesions. Our compendium was defined by 11 cases of borderline melanocytic proliferations whereby sentinel node sampling was conducted. There were three severely atypical dermal-epidermal melanocytic proliferations manifesting borderline features with nevoid melanoma (calf, shoulder, knee), three arising in association with a deep penetrating nevus (chest, shoulder, and arm), three atypical Spitz?s tumors (helix, calf, arm, back), and two atypical pigment-synthesizing melanocytic tumors, resembling equine melanotic disease in one and cellular blue nevus in another (buttock, calf, arm). The patient population comprised seven males and five females ranging in age from age 9?36 (mean: 25 years). At least one positive sentinel lymph node was uncovered in seven of the cases with a positive sentinel lymph observed in all but one case of deep penetrating nevus and atypical Spitz?s tumor. The identification of sentinel lymph node positivity in seven of the twelve cases (58%) validates the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the setting of borderline melanocytic proliferations.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was approved by the University of Nottingham Ethics and Welfare Committee. The study was performed on material collected at an abattoir. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the activity and tolerability of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma that were ineligible for surgical resection or with owners who declined surgical resection, and underwent 3D-CRT were retrospectively reviewed. 6 to 10 Gy per fraction was prescribed at isocentre of planning target volume to a total dose of 18 to 42 Gy with 1 to 2 fractions per week for a total of 3 to 7 fractions. Follow-up examinations included physical examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan and blood analysis (complete blood count, electrolytes and serum biochemical panel). RESULTS The median follow-up time after 3D-CRT was 534 (range, 281 to 1057) days. An objective response was observed in five of six cases. Radiation-induced liver disease developed in one dog but was asymptomatic and reversible. Toxicity was not noted in any other dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 3D-CRT appears to be a viable treatment option for dogs with inoperable massive hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Abstract Background The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor in the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is localized throughout ascending sensory pathways (skin, peripheral nerve, dorsal root ganglion, spinal cord), and in cell types interacting with sensory neurons (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes and macrophages). Neuronal RAGE expression increases in pathological pain states in humans and rodents, and soluble RAGE attenuates thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic mice. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether pharmacological modulation of RAGE could attenuate mechanical allodynia in rodent pain models. Methods We developed an anti-RAGE monoclonal antibody (11E6) that binds to the C2 immunoglobulin domain of human RAGE, binds to mouse RAGE, and presumably to the same domain in mouse RAGE. The antinociceptive activity of 11E6 was investigated in mouse models of inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) and neuropathic (chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve) pain. Mice were dosed intraperitoneally with 11E6 or IgG (negative control). Results Increased mechanical thresholds were observed following a single dose of 11E6 in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Similar treatment with IgG did not alter nociceptive sensitivity. Repeated dosing with 11E6 significantly attenuated established mechanical hypersensitivity in a neuropathic pain model in a dose-related fashion. Conclusions These data demonstrate that specific modulation of RAGE effectively attenuates nociceptive sensitivity associated with chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

AB  - Clear cell hidradenoma is a benign eccrine tumor with nodular-cystic architecture, ductal differentiation and poroid cytology. Squamous islands occurring in eccrine neoplasms are classified into three types, according to their location, histologic characteristics and degrees of cellular atypia. Type I squamous islands resemble normal epidermis and are present in the superficial to middle portion of eccrine poromas. Type II squamous islands are localised in the deeper portion of eccrine poromas and show lumen formation suggestive of acrosyringeal differentiation. Type III squamous islands show atypical features and are limited to malignant eccrine tumors. A 55-year-old man was biopsied for a dermal nodule on his left arm. The initial shave biopsy revealed the surface of an intradermal cystic nodule with numerous whorls and horn pearls of squamatization, reminiscent?of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; however, no cytologic atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity were identified; focal clear cell and ductal differentiation were also present. Complete excision revealed clear cell hidradenoma with extensive mixed type I and type II squamous islands. The presence of whorls and pearls of squamoid cells is a rare finding in clear cell hidradenoma that, moreover, in the setting of a superficial biopsy, may be a diagnostic pitfall.

AB  - There is a recent trend to feed pet dogs and cats in Britain and other developed countries on raw meat and animal by-products using either commercial preparations or home recipes. This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria. Other infectious organisms that may be of concern include Listeria, shiga toxigenic E scherichia coli , parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and exotic agents such as the zoonotic livestock pathogen Brucella suis, recently identified in European Union and UK raw pet meat imported from Argentina.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with neurological deficits and loss of motor function that, depending on the severity, may lead to paralysis. The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 ?g/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 ?g was found to be as effective as 100 ?g in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury. Studies are underway in chronic SCI in a follow up manuscript.

AB  - The histopathological changes of herpes simplex, zoster and varicella are considered to be indistinguishable from one another. The clinical setting with adjunctive studies generally clarifies the diagnosis. Vesicular lesions in all 3 conditions can involve epidermal and adnexal epithelium with characteristic cytopathic features. We describe 3 patients with non-vesicular eruptions on the head and neck whose biopsies revealed exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes. All three patients developed typical herpes zoster within days of the biopsy. There is compelling scientific evidence in the literature indicating that, in herpes zoster, the virus is transported from dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia via myelinated nerves to the skin. These terminate at the isthmus of hair follicles and primary infection of follicular and sebaceous epithelium occurs. Secondary spread of infection to the epidermis follows. In contrast, data pertaining to recurrent herpes simplex indicates that axonal transport of the virus from sensory ganglia to the skin is directed primarily to the epidermis, via terminal non-myelinated nerve twigs. The clinical evolution of our 3 cases and scientific data in the literature indicate that exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes, in the setting of a non-vesicular eruption, represents early herpes zoster.

Mortality is high because of the severe subsequent relevant complications caused by the fistula. Here we report five cases of gastric stump-pleural fistula diagnosed by air perfusion radiography under digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA air perfusion radiography provides a reliable basis for the development of clinical programmes; it is a simple method which does not involve any pain or trauma to the patient.

AB  - Histological differentiation between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms such as trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma can be difficult on small biopsies. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify immunohistochemical differences between these entities. Recent studies showed androgen receptor expression in a number of mature epithelial structures in the skin and in epithelial neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, androgen receptor expression was absent in mature hair follicles or the few trichogenic neoplasms studied to date. These findings suggested that androgen receptor expression might be a useful adjunct in the histological differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of androgen receptor expression in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign trichoblastic tumors (6 trichoepitheliomas and 4 trichoblastomas). In our study, expression of androgen receptor was detected in 78% of basal cell carcinomas. None of the trichoblastic tumors showed any androgen receptor immunoreactivity. These results confirm the lack of androgen receptor expression in benign trichoblastic neoplasms and indicate that finding of androgen receptor expression points to basal cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Fabry disease is an X-linked glycosphingolipid storage disorder resulting from deficiency of α-galactosidase A. Storage of globotriaosylceramide ultimately results in multiorgan pathology, including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and renal disease. Vascular involvement is evident throughout the body but the mechanisms by which storage on a cellular level leads to end-organ pathology are unknown. Here the evidence for abnormal blood flow, vessel architecture and endothelial function will be reviewed and possible models of vascular pathology discussed. The effects of reversal of storage within vessels by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and the possibilities for intervention with additional agents will be considered. Conclusion: The pathology of Fabry disease has an important vascular component, although the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Preliminary evidence suggests that ERT may have beneficial effects on the vascular component of this multisystem disease.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To report symptoms and ocular pathology in 13 patients exposed to light from laser pointers. Methods We conducted a multi-centre consecutive case series from eight ophthalmology departments. Results Eleven boys aged 9?15 years and two girls aged 7 (sister of one of the aforementioned boys) and 12 years, respectively, were included. Laser wavelengths were 572 nm (green), 450 nm (blue), and red laser of unknown wavelength. Output powers were between 5 and 5000 mW. Evaluation included slit lamp examination, colour fundus photography (CFP), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). All subjects complained of unilateral vision loss. Initial visual acuities in exposed eyes ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 Snellen equivalent or better. Nine subjects showed pathology on CFP and OCT abnormalities. One subject had a macular hole, which closed after vitrectomy. Long-term visual acuity ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 Snellen equivalent or better. Conclusion High-powered laser pointers have become readily available on the internet, and they have the potential to induce lasting visual loss. More than half of the published laser pointer maculopathy cases since the first incidence in 1999 have been published in 2014?2017. We suspect that incidence of exposure and subsequent visual loss is rising, and we encourage national legislators to regulate this market.

AB  - Background In preclinical studies with cynomolgus macaques, it is common to have one or more females presenting with menses. Published literature indicates that the blood lost during menses causes decreases in red blood cell mass variables (RBC, HGB, and HCT), which would be a confounding factor in the interpretation of drug-related effects on clinical pathology data, but no scientific data have been published to support this claim. Objectives This investigation was conducted to determine if the amount of blood lost during menses in cynomolgus macaques has an effect on routine hematology and serum chemistry variables. Methods Ten female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), 5 to 6.5 years old, were observed daily during approximately 3 months (97 days) for the presence of menses. Hematology and serum chemistry variables were evaluated twice weekly. Results The results indicated that menstruation affects the erythrogram including RBC, HGB, HCT, MCHC, MCV, reticulocyte count, RDW, the leukogram including neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and chemistry variables, including GGT activity, and the concentrations of total proteins, albumin, globulins, and calcium. The magnitude of the effect of menstruation on susceptible variables is dependent on the duration of the menstrual phase. Macaques with menstrual phases lasting ≥ 7 days are more likely to develop changes in variables related to chronic blood loss. Conclusions In preclinical toxicology studies with cynomolgus macaques, interpretation of changes in several commonly evaluated hematology and serum chemistry variables requires adequate clinical observation and documentation concerning presence and duration of menses. There is a concern that macaques with long menstrual cycles can develop iron deficiency anemia due to chronic menstrual blood loss.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, due to a poorly understood combination of genetic, environmental, and immune factors. The JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program recovers transplantation quality pancreas from organ donors throughout the USA. In addition to recovery of donors with T1D, non-diabetic donors include those with islet autoantibodies. Donors with type 2 diabetes and other conditions are also recovered to aid investigations directed at the full spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting beta cells. One central processing laboratory conducts standardized procedures for sample processing, storage, and distribution, intended for current and future cutting edge investigations. Baseline histology characterizations are performed on the pancreatic samples, with images of the staining results provided though whole-slide digital scans. Uniquely, these high-grade biospecimens are provided without expense to investigators, working worldwide, seeking methods for disease prevention and reversal strategies. Collaborative working groups are highly encouraged, bringing together multiple investigators with different expertise to foster collaborations in several areas of critical need. This mini-review will provide some key histopathological findings emanating from the nPOD collection, including the heterogeneity of beta cell loss and islet inflammation (insulitis), beta cell mass, insulin-producing beta cells in chronic T1D, and pancreas weight reductions at disease onset. Analysis of variations in histopathology observed from these organ donors could provide for mechanistic differences related to etiological agents and serve an important function in terms of identifying the heterogeneity of T1D.

AB  - Acetylglucosoaminyltransferase V (GNTV), an enzyme responsible for branching of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Beta1?6 branched oligosaccharides, detected with the lectin, LPHA, are associated with tumor progression in human breast and colon cancer. They were found to be common to 22 types of human cancers, and were particularly expressed in metastases. Matriptase is a proteolytic inducer of both the HGF/cmet and plasminogen activator pathways, highly associated with metastasis. A potential prometastatic effect of GNTV was found to be due to modification of active matriptase by adding beta1?6 GlcNAc branching. We investigated expression of LPHA, matriptase and GNTV in pathology specimens of primary invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas. Sequential sections were stained with anti-GnT-V, anti-matriptase, or biotinylated LPHA. Our results showed variable staining patterns, from involving only small regions, to encompassing the entire tumor. The expression of all three markers was closely associated, suggesting that metastatic pathways might have been activated in the staining areas of these tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of matriptase expression in malignant melanoma, as well as the first demonstration of an association between matriptase, GNTV and beta 1,6-branched oligosaccharides in vivo.
