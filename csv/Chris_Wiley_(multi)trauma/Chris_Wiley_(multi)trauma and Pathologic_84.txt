AB  - The threat of no longer being the person one wants to be hovers over each ill person and plays out relationally. The dynamic interplay of this experience of self-loss and other-loss (Roos, 2002; Weingarten, 2012) has a significant impact on couples, both of whom may come to have both experiences. In this article, I focus on the couples' experience of self- and other-loss in the context of chronic illness, in which one person's experience flows into and informs the other's. In particular, I describe how asymmetric acknowledgment of self-loss and other-loss adds to the misery of couples who are already challenged by poor health. Physical pain also makes dealing with self- and other-loss harder. Therapists can serve couples better if they take a fully collaborative stance; appreciate the dilemmas of witnessing; help couples distinguish new trauma from retraumatization and fear; work with the weaver's dilemma and the boatman's plight (Weingarten, 2012); and are comfortable with discussion of end of life issues.

AB  - The incidence and severity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) increase with advancing age, as does the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Not surprisingly, heterogeneous forms of CVD may coexist with AD changes in the ?ageing brain?. These include angiopathies (affecting both large and small arteries) that result from ?classical? risk factors (hypertension, smoking and diabetes) and others (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) that are biochemically closely linked to AD. The morphologic consequences of these various vascular diseases are infarcts and/or haemorrhages of varying sizes within the brain, which lead to neurocognitive decline that may mimic AD ? though the vascular abnormalities are usually detectable by neuroimaging. More subtle effects of CVD may include neuroinflammation and biochemical ?lesions? that have no reliable morphologic correlate and thus escape the attention of even an experienced Neuropathologist. The pathogenesis of hippocampal injury resembling ischaemic change ? commonly seen in the brains of geriatric subjects ? remains controversial. In recent years, genetically determined forms of microangiopathy (e.g. CADASIL, CARASIL, Trex1-related microangiopathies, CARASAL, familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA) have provided interesting cellular and molecular clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic microvascular disease such as arteriolosclerosis and AD-related CAA.

AB  - Abstract Despite the importance of neurological assessment, there is a lack of research directed at nurses' competency in performing these assessments. We aimed to identify nurses' competency levels in performing neurological assessments and prioritize their related training needs using importance?performance analysis. This survey research was conducted and reported based on the enhancing the quality and transparency of health research (EQUATOR) guidelines. A total of 213 nurses participated in a descriptive, cross-sectional survey study. Exploratory factor analysis identified seven factors that together accounted for 70.34% of the variance: cerebral function, signs and symptoms, pathologic reflexes, motor strength, assessment of an unconscious patient, reporting and documentation, and neurological assessment scales. [Correction added on 10 February 2020, after first online publication: the value of the variance has been corrected from ?7.34%? to ?70.34%? in the preceding sentence.] There were significant gaps between importance and performance for all seven factors. The importance?performance matrix identified the neurological assessment scales factor as a high priority for continuing education. Emergency department nurses reported lower neurological assessment competency when compared with ward and intensive care unit nurses. The analysis of training needs is beneficial for developing programs to enhance neurological assessment competency. Training in neurological assessment scales is a priority for nurses, and they prefer simulation- and practicum-based methods.

AB  - Purpose:? The objective was to investigate the association between corneal sensitivity and established measures of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Methods:? Corneal sensitivity was measured in 93 individuals with diabetes, 146 diabetic individuals without neuropathy and 61 control individuals without diabetes or neuropathy using a non-contact corneal aesthesiometer at the baseline visit of a five-year longitudinal natural history study of DPN. The correlation between corneal sensitivity and established measures of neuropathy was estimated and multi-dimensional scaling was used to represent similarities and dissimilarities between variables. Results:? The corneal sensitivity threshold was significantly correlated with a majority of established measures of DPN. Correlation coefficients ranged from -0.32 to 0.26. Using multi-dimensional scaling, non-contact corneal aesthesiometry was closer to the neuropathy disability score, diabetic neuropathy symptom score and Neuropad and most dissimilar to electrophysiological parameters and quantitative sensory testing. Conclusion:? Corneal sensitivity, although not strongly related, is associated with other functional measures of DPN and might provide a useful adjunct in identifying functional loss of small nerve fibre integrity.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 709?716 Although advances in surgical techniques and bone grafting have significantly improved the functional and cosmetic restoration of craniofacial structures lost because of trauma or disease, there are still significant limitations in our ability to regenerate these tissues. The regeneration of oral and craniofacial tissues presents a formidable challenge that requires synthesis of basic science, clinical science, and engineering technology. Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field of study that addresses this challenge by applying the principles of engineering to biology and medicine toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, and improve normal function. This review will explore the impact of biomaterials design, stem cell biology and gene therapy on craniofacial tissue engineering.

AB  - Aim? Correct patient and specimen identification and labelling are critical to ensuring that the correct results are issued for the right patient, and that medical decisions and treatments given on the basis of these test results are appropriate. This is particularly critical in pre-transfusion testing with the risk of ABO mismatch transfusion and potential fatality a real possibility. Background: Over 11?months, data relating to mislabelled specimens demonstrated a basal rate of 2 ?wrong-blood-in-tube?(WBIT) incidents per month and 8 of 23 were for pre-transfusion testing. These incidents were detected only where inconsistencies either in clinical information or previous test results were apparent. Intervention Our pathology service developed a set of strict minimum identification criteria for ALL pathology specimens and a policy of rejection of specimens that do not comply. These criteria align with ANZSBT guidelines for pre-transfusion samples. An 8?week education and notification phase followed by strict application of the criteria in February 2004 and a subsequent follow-up phase was conducted. Result? Smooth implementation of a major network-wide initiative has occurred over the last 5?months, as evidenced by the low specimen incident rate of 1%. Early indicators of success include an increased awareness of WBIT episodes with three self-reported episodes of WBIT since implementation. Unlabelled specimens have reduced by at least 50% compared to the same period prior to intervention. Conclusion? Our experience may be of interest to other institutions considering similar initiatives. A reduction in WBIT events is the most preferred outcome, however it may be many months before this can be appreciated due to low detection levels.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of preputial cytology in oestrogen producing testicular tumours in dogs. Methods Forty-five dogs with palpable testicular masses and 30 healthy control dogs were included. Dogs were evaluated for signs of alopecia and/or feminisation. Analyses of preputial cytology, haematology and serum oestradiol were performed. Dogs with testicular masses were neutered and the testes were submitted for histopathological examination. The dogs were divided into three groups (1) control dogs (n=30), (2) dogs with a testicular mass and serum oestradiol concentration <40 pmol/L (n=35), (3) dogs with a testicular mass and serum oestradiol concentration >40 pmol/L (n=10). Results More than 20% superficial cells in preputial smear was significantly associated with serum oestradiol concentration >40 pmol/L (P<0·001). The number of superficial cells was significantly increased (P<0·001) in preputial smears from dogs with alopecia. Clinical Significance It appears that the preputial cytology has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of oestrogen producing testicular tumours in dogs.

AB  - Background: Plasmacytosis is a rare entity, which may manifest with cutaneous patches and plaques and may subsequently progress to involve extracutaneous sites. First described in Japan by Kimura K et al in 1983, most cases have been reported in patients of Asian descent. Observation: We report a case of plasmacytosis in a 52-year-old Hispanic woman, who presented ten years ago with cutaneous infiltrates of plasma cells and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Numerous (immunohistochemical, molecular, serologic) studies failed to demonstrate a clonal lymphoplasmacellular neoplasm, collagen vascular disease or chronic infection. Her course has been slowly progressive with new plaques developing on the integument. Plasma cells have since infiltrated gastric and esophageal mucosa, the left temporal artery and lymph nodes. The disease has been resistant to various therapeutic approaches. Conclusions: Our case provides long-term follow-up of a patient with plasmacytosis and illustrates the chronic progressive course of this disease over a 10-year course with unique involvement of the temporal artery and gastrointestinal mucosa.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

AB  - Objectives The association between the use of forceps and levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion seems to be clear-cut. However, whether the lesion is due to the mechanical trauma yielded by the instrument or to the intrinsic complexity of this type of delivery, is yet to be determined. This study aims at determining the difference in LAM avulsion rate between Kielland rotational forceps and non-rotational forceps. Study Design Prospective observational study with 94 nulliparous women with forceps-assisted deliveries (FD) between July 2015 and January 2016. 3D-TpUS was performed 6 months after every patient's delivery, during which LAM avulsion, and levator hiatus area and anteroposterior and transverse diameters were assessed. Results A total of 89 nulliparous were studied, comprising 27 rotational-FD, and 62 non-rotational-FD. No differences in obstetric, intrapartum, or neonatal characteristics were observed between study groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of avulsion between cases of rotational forceps (44.4% vs 35.5%, OR: 1.5 [0.6-3.6]), correction of asinclitism of the fetal head (34.4% vs. 40.4% OR: 0.8 [0.3-1.9]) or station (midforceps: 32.8% vs low forceps: 50.0% OR: 2.0 [0.8-5.1]). Conclusions We have not observed differences in the LAM-avulsion rate between rotational forceps and non-rotational forceps performed by highly experienced personnel in instrumental deliveries.

AB  - ABSTRACT We report our experience of 42 patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating intrinsic lesions of the spinal cord, excluding those secondary to spondylosis, trauma or congenital malformations. Histological confirmation of the radiological diagnosis was obtained in 15 (36%). MRI is more sensitive than either myelography or CT. MRI identified a previously non-visualised lesion in 17 of 30 cases. In a further 13 cases, MRI contributed by identifying associated features such as cysts and haemorrhage which have aided in the diagnosis and management of the patients. The last 12 cases, which were patients with multiple sclerosis, had MRI as the only neuroradiological examination. These illustrate a range of appearances. The overlap of imaging appearances of the various pathologies implies that a useful diagnosis and differential can only be offered by considering the MRI appearances of a lesion, with its associated features, with the clinical presentation, and with other imaging modalities where appropriate.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe psychiatric disorder that has profound impact on an individual?s life and on society. Thus, developing more effective therapeutic interventions is essential. Over the past quarter-century, an abundance of evidence from pharmacologic challenges, post-mortem studies, brain imaging, and genetic studies supports the role of glutamatergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and the results of recent randomized clinical trials based on this evidence have yielded promising results. In this article, we review the evidence that alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission, especially focusing on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function, may be a critical causative feature of schizophrenia, how this contributes to pathologic circuit function in the brain, and how these insights are revealing whole new avenues for treatment development that could reduce treatment-resistant symptoms, which account for persistent disability.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.
