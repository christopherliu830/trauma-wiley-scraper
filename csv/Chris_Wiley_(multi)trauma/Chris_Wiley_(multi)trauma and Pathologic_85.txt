AB  - An intrathoracic mass was discovered as an incidental finding in a 14-year-old, spayed, female Rottweiler cross during evaluation of urinary incontinence. Computed tomography suggested a pericardial or pleural location and high adipose content of the mass. The mass was removed via lateral thoracotomy with partial pericardectomy and was diagnosed as a pericardial lipoma. The dog recovered well, and there was no evidence of recurrence approximately one year later. Adipose tumours of the heart and its associated structures are rare in dogs and have been associated with both successful and fatal outcomes.

AB  - Abstract ? Attachment and spreading of phagocytes on a mineralized tissue surface is crucial for their proper resorptive function. In other studies, attachment and spreading have been shown to be highly dependent on the nature and composition of the surface. In the present study, peritoneal macrophages were cultured on infected and non-infected mineralized and non-mineralized dental tissues, which were examined with scanning electron microscopy at different observation periods. Although some cells had attached to non-infected predentin, only a few showed signs of spreading, even after long incubation times. This contrasted with the behavior of macrophages cultivated on enamel, mineralized dentin and infected predentin. Most of these cells showed spreading and the characteristics of active, phagocytosing cells. The reluctance of macrophages to spread on non-infected predentin was suggested to be due to the non-mineralized nature of this tissue, although an influence of endogenous resorption inhibitors cannot be excluded.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe psychiatric disorder that has profound impact on an individual?s life and on society. Thus, developing more effective therapeutic interventions is essential. Over the past quarter-century, an abundance of evidence from pharmacologic challenges, post-mortem studies, brain imaging, and genetic studies supports the role of glutamatergic dysregulation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and the results of recent randomized clinical trials based on this evidence have yielded promising results. In this article, we review the evidence that alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission, especially focusing on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function, may be a critical causative feature of schizophrenia, how this contributes to pathologic circuit function in the brain, and how these insights are revealing whole new avenues for treatment development that could reduce treatment-resistant symptoms, which account for persistent disability.

AB  - Abstract Aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) is defined by the presence of two types of tau-bearing astrocytes: thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSAs) and granular/fuzzy astrocytes in the brain of old-aged individuals. The present study is focused on TSAs in rare forms of ARTAG with no neuronal tau pathology or restricted to entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices, to avoid bias from associated tauopathies. TSAs show 4Rtau phosphorylation at several specific sites and abnormal tau conformation, but they lack ubiquitin and they are not immunostained with tau-C3 antibodies which recognize truncated tau at Asp421. Astrocytes in ARTAG have atrophic processes, reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and increased superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) immunoreactivity. Gel electrophoresis and western blotting of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions reveal a pattern of phospho-tau in ARTAG characterized by two bands of 68 and 64 kDa, and several middle bands between 35 and 50 kDa which differ from what is seen in AD. Phosphoproteomics of dissected vulnerable regions identifies an increase of phosphorylation marks in a large number of proteins in ARTAG compared with controls. GFAP, aquaporin 4, several serine-threonine kinases, microtubule associated proteins and other neuronal proteins are among the differentially phosphorylated proteins in ARTAG thus suggesting a hyper-phosphorylation background that affects several molecules, including many kinases and proteins from several cell compartments and various cell types. Finally, present results show for the first time that tau seeding is produced in neurons of the hippocampal complex, astrocytes, oligodendroglia and along fibers of the corpus callosum, fimbria and fornix following inoculation into the hippocampus of wild type mice of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions enriched in hyper-phosphorylated tau from selected ARTAG cases. These findings show astrocytes as crucial players of tau seeding in tauopathies.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - ABSTRACT Regulation of bone formation is important in the pathogenesis of many conditions such as osteoporosis, fracture healing, and loosening of orthopedic implants. We have recently identified a novel rat cDNA (best5) by differential display PCR that is regulated during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Expression of best5 mRNA is induced in cultures of osteoblasts by both interferon-α (IFN-α) or IFN-?. Whereas IFN-α induced a rapid, transient induction of best5 expression peaking at 4?6 h poststimulation, IFN- ? elicited a more prolonged induction of best5 expression, which remained elevated 48 h poststimulation. A polyclonal antibody generated to a peptide derived from the best5 coding region recognized a 27 kDa protein on Western blot analysis of osteoblast ly-sates. We localized BEST5 protein in osteoblast progenitor cells and mature osteoblasts in sections of rat tibiae and in sections of bones loaded in vivo to induce adaptive bone formation. Best5 maytherefore be a fundamental intermediate in the response of osteoblasts to stimuli that modulate proliferation/ differentiation, such as interferons or mechanical loading. These findings highlight the close interactions between the immune system and bone cells and may open new therapeutic avenues in modulating bone mass?Grewal, T. S., Genever, P. G., Brabbs, A.

AB  - Background and Purpose Postoperative pain is one of the most common manifestations of acute pain and is an important problem faced by patients after surgery. Moreover, neuronal trauma or chemotherapeutic treatment often causes neuropathic pain, which induces disabling and distressing symptoms. At present, treatments of both painful conditions are inadequate. α-Spinasterol, which is well characterized as a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 antagonist, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antinociceptive effects. Therefore, we investigated its antinociceptive potential on postoperative and neuropathic pain, as well as its effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activities. Experimental Approach Nociceptive responses in a postoperative pain model (surgical incision-induced) or different neuropathic pain models (trauma or chemotherapy-induced) were investigated in mice. Key Results Oral administration of α-spinasterol reduced postoperative pain, when given as a pre- (0.5 h before incision) or post-treatment (0.5 h after incision), and reduced cell infiltration in the injured tissue. α-Spinasterol also reduced the mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation and the mechanical and cold allodynia induced by paclitaxel. Moreover, α-spinasterol inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities without altering the body temperature of animals. Importantly, α-spinasterol did not alter spontaneous or forced locomotor activity. Furthermore, it did not cause gastric damage or liver and kidney changes, nor did it alter cell viability in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord slices of mice. Conclusion and Implications α-Spinasterol is an effective and safe COX inhibitor with antinociceptive effects in postoperative and neuropathic pain models. Therefore, it is an interesting prototype for the development of novel analgesic drugs.

AB  - Abstract Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, levels of increased CSF tau protein and decreased levels of ?-amyloid 1?42 (A?42) have been shown to correlate with brain plaque formation and tangle pathology. Intracellular Lewy inclusions containing aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) represent a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In most ? but not all ? studies published to date total CSF α-syn concentrations have been found to be decreased in disorders related to α-syn pathology, that is, PD, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. However, these reports show extensive signal overlap among tested individuals, thereby diminishing its potential for routine use in clinical practice. To investigate potential biological (i.e., non-technical) confounders of reported CSF levels for α-syn, A?42, and tau in PD and related disorders, we carried out a methodical review of known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. We discuss several biological factors, such as neuropathology, demographics, clinical phenotype, progression and duration of disease, concomitant illnesses and, last but not least, pharmacotherapy, which in isolation or combination can substantially alter values for CSF proteins of interest. Enhanced implementation of standardized clinical protocols, streamlined operating procedures, and further progress in the development of validated assays for CSF proteins have the potential to (i) inform us as to the pathogenesis of disease, (ii) support the laboratory-based diagnosis for symptomatic subjects in the future, and (iii) facilitate breakthrough therapies to alter the course of neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate potential biological confounders of reported CSF levels for α-synuclein (α-Syn), amyloid-? 1-42(A?42) and tau protein in Parkinson's disease and related disorders, we reviewed the current literature for known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary artery thrombosis (PAT) is involved in lung vascular dysfunction during acute chest syndrome (ACS) complicating sickle cell disease (SCD). No clinical score is available to identify patients eligible for multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography during ACS. This retrospective study aimed to develop a risk score for PAT during ACS (PAT-ACS risk score). Patients with SCD were investigated by MDCT during ACS. A logistic regression was performed to determine independent risks factors for PAT and to build the PAT-ACS risk score. A total of 43 episodes (11·9%) of PAT were diagnosed in 361 episodes of ACS. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors, which were included in the PAT-ACS risk score: a baseline haemoglobin >82 g/l, the lack of a triggering factor for ACS, a platelet count >440 ? 109/l and a PaCO2 <38 mmHg at ACS diagnosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the PAT-ACS risk score was 0·74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0·69?0·79) and differed from that of the revised Geneva score (0·63 (95% CI 0·58?0·69); P = 0·04). The negative predictive value of a PAT-ACS risk score ≥2 was 94%. In conclusion, we propose a simple clinical risk score to identify SCD patients at high risk of PAT during ACS.

AB  - Abstract Chronic diabetic complications ? both microvascular and macrovascular ? have become serious health issues with their increasing prevalence paralleling the dramatic rise of the diabetic population worldwide. Of these complications, foot disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, consuming more health care resource than all other complications combined. Diabetic polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease constitute the two main risk factors, with trauma and foot infection being the most important initiating factors and contributors to delayed healing. Intracellular oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycaemia along with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking constitute the main pathological processes in the aetiology of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. Whilst the former remains the major cause of overall mortality in diabetes, the role of microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of diabetes foot disease and its contribution to delayed wound healing in diabetes has yet to be fully understood and indeed continues to be debated. This article will review the key findings to date on structural and functional microvascular abnormalities in the diabetic foot skin and consider their contribution to impaired would healing.

AB  - An 8-year-old male dog was presented with a peri-urethral intrapelvic mass with the characteristics of a sarcoma on computed tomography and cytology evaluation. A two-step procedure leading to a permanent urinary diversion was performed. During the same procedure, the caudal pelvic urethra and mass were resected and an extrapelvic anastomosis of the pelvic portion of the urethra to its penile portion was performed after passage of the pelvic urethra through the inguinal canal. The procedure successfully produced a tension-free end-to-end urethral anastomosis and no complications were observed during the postoperative period. Histologically, the lesion was reported as a narrowly excised liposarcoma. A 4-week course of curative intent of radiotherapy was initiated 2 weeks after surgery. Eight months later, the dog was free of clinical signs.

AB  - Background: Hypernasality is a common feature of non-progressive dysarthria. However, limited research has investigated the effectiveness of treatments for this impairment. Preliminary research has revealed positive effects on nasalance when using increased loudness in certain non-progressive dysarthric speakers. However, the long-term effects of loud speech on nasalance as part of a structured intervention such as Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)? are yet to be investigated in this population. Aims: The study aimed to investigate the short- and long-term effects of LSVT? on hypernasality (perceptual ratings and degree of nasalance) in non-progressive dysarthria; and secondly, to evaluate the effects of traditional dysarthria therapy on these same measures, in comparison with the effects of LSVT?. Methods & Procedures: Ten non-progressive dysarthric speakers with varying levels of hypernasality (taken from a larger research study) were randomly allocated to receive LSVT? (n = 5) or individually tailored traditional dysarthria therapy (n = 5). Both treatments were administered four times weekly for 4 weeks (that is, 16 ? 1-hour sessions). Participants were assessed twice before treatment, twice immediately post-treatment, and twice at follow-up 6 months post-treatment using a perceptual rating task performed by two independent speech pathologists, and the Nasometer. Changes to individual mean nasalance scores were compared against clinically significant criterion and perceptual ratings were analysed descriptively. Outcomes & Results: Three out of five participants demonstrated reductions in perceived hypernasality immediately following LSVT?, but these changes were maintained at follow-up for only one participant. Two of these three participants demonstrated a corresponding reduction in mean nasalance. Limited changes in perceived hypernasality and nasalance scores were found following traditional dysarthria therapy, with only one participant exhibiting reduced nasalance at follow-up. Conclusions & Implications: Due to the small sample size in the present research and variability between participants, further exploration into the effects of LSVT? on nasality with a larger population with different dysarthria types is essential.

AB  - Abstract:? We reviewed all occurrences of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in children under 17?years of age who were evaluated at Sainte-Justine Hospital, a tertiary-care pediatric center, between 1980 and 2002. The medical records and histologic features of all were reviewed. Eight patients were identified, three boys and five girls. The interval between apparent onset and diagnosis ranged from 3?months to 14?years. All lesions except one were removed by surgical excision with a margin of 1.5 to 3?cm including underlying fascia or by Mohs technique. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 15?years with median of 5?years. To date all the patients are alive and none has had a recurrence.

AB  - This study examines the impact of children?s exposure to natural disaster against the backdrop of exposure to other traumatic events and psychosocial risks. One thousand three hundred ninety-eight Sri Lankan children aged 9?15?years were interviewed in 4 cross-sectional studies about exposure to traumatic life events related to the war, the tsunami experience, and family violence. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, somatic complaints, psychosocial functioning, and teacher reports of school grades served as outcome measures. A global outcome variable of ?positive adaptation? was created from a combination of these measures. Data showed extensive exposure to adversity and traumatic events among children in Sri Lanka. Findings of regression analyses indicated that all 3 event types?tsunami and disaster, war, and family violence?significantly contributed to poorer child adaptation.
