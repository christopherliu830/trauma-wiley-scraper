AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Background: Hypernasality is a common feature of non-progressive dysarthria. However, limited research has investigated the effectiveness of treatments for this impairment. Preliminary research has revealed positive effects on nasalance when using increased loudness in certain non-progressive dysarthric speakers. However, the long-term effects of loud speech on nasalance as part of a structured intervention such as Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)? are yet to be investigated in this population. Aims: The study aimed to investigate the short- and long-term effects of LSVT? on hypernasality (perceptual ratings and degree of nasalance) in non-progressive dysarthria; and secondly, to evaluate the effects of traditional dysarthria therapy on these same measures, in comparison with the effects of LSVT?. Methods & Procedures: Ten non-progressive dysarthric speakers with varying levels of hypernasality (taken from a larger research study) were randomly allocated to receive LSVT? (n = 5) or individually tailored traditional dysarthria therapy (n = 5). Both treatments were administered four times weekly for 4 weeks (that is, 16 ? 1-hour sessions). Participants were assessed twice before treatment, twice immediately post-treatment, and twice at follow-up 6 months post-treatment using a perceptual rating task performed by two independent speech pathologists, and the Nasometer. Changes to individual mean nasalance scores were compared against clinically significant criterion and perceptual ratings were analysed descriptively. Outcomes & Results: Three out of five participants demonstrated reductions in perceived hypernasality immediately following LSVT?, but these changes were maintained at follow-up for only one participant. Two of these three participants demonstrated a corresponding reduction in mean nasalance. Limited changes in perceived hypernasality and nasalance scores were found following traditional dysarthria therapy, with only one participant exhibiting reduced nasalance at follow-up. Conclusions & Implications: Due to the small sample size in the present research and variability between participants, further exploration into the effects of LSVT? on nasality with a larger population with different dysarthria types is essential.

APMIS 2010; 118: 595?605. Long-term clinical use of glucocorticoids often causes the serious side effect of non-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), on differentiation of primary cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMCs). We also tried to block the inhibitory effects of Dex on osteoblast differentiation. Adipocyte markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor?-2 and aP2) were increased in response to Dex treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while osteoblastic markers [Runx2, COL 1, osterix, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and OC] were down-regulated, consistent with ALP and osteocalcin promoter activity. To validate the effects of Runx2 on the expression of osteogenesis and adipocyte genes, pCMV/Flag-Runx2 was transfected into BMCs, and relevant markers were detected after 10?7?M Dex treatment for 48?h. The results indicated that Dex treatment induced adipogenic differentiation and suppressed proliferation. No significant difference was detected in expressions of these genes between Runx2-transfected cells and Dex-treated BMCs. These data suggest that Dex primarily induced adipocyte differentiation of BMCs. Exogenous Runx2 can antagonize the effect of Dex on osteoblast differentiation.

AB  - Abstract Seventy-five percent of all traumatic brain injuries are mild and do not cause readily visible abnormalities on routine medical imaging making it difficult to predict which individuals will develop unwanted clinical sequelae. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages and early responders to brain insults. Their activation is associated with changes in morphology or expression of phenotypic markers including P2Y12 and major histocompatibility complex class II. Using a murine model of unrestrained mild closed head injury (mCHI), we used microglia as reporters of acute brain injury at sites of impact versus sites experiencing rotational stress 24 h post-mCHI. Consistent with mild injury, a modest 20% reduction in P2Y12 expression was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis but only in the impacted region of the cortex. Furthermore, neither an influx of blood-derived immune cells nor changes in microglial expression of CD45, TREM1, TREM2, major histocompatibility complex class II or CD40 were detected. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), small reductions in T2 weighted values were observed but only near the area of impact and without overt tissue damage (blood deposition, edema). Microglial morphology was quantified without cryosectioning artifacts using ScaleA2 clarified brains from CX3CR1-green fluorescence protein (GFP) mice. The cortex rostral to the mCHI impact site receives greater rotational stress but neither MRI nor molecular markers of microglial activation showed significant changes from shams in this region. However, microglia in this rostral region did display signs of morphologic activation equivalent to that observed in severe CHI. Thus, mCHI-triggered rotational stress is sufficient to cause injuries undetectable by routine MRI that could result in altered microglial surveillance of brain homeostasis. Acute changes in microglial morphology reveal brain responses to unrestrained mild traumatic brain injury In areas subjected to rotational stress distant from impact site In the absence of detectable changes in standard molecular indicators of brain damage, inflammation or microglial activation. That might result in decreased surveillance of brain function and increased susceptibility to subsequent brain insults.

We reviewed all occurrences of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in children under 17?years of age who were evaluated at Sainte-Justine Hospital, a tertiary-care pediatric center, between 1980 and 2002. The medical records and histologic features of all were reviewed. Eight patients were identified, three boys and five girls. The interval between apparent onset and diagnosis ranged from 3?months to 14?years. All lesions except one were removed by surgical excision with a margin of 1.5 to 3?cm including underlying fascia or by Mohs technique. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 15?years with median of 5?years. To date all the patients are alive and none has had a recurrence.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether breed affects the ability of murmur intensity to predict the severity of stenosis in dogs with pulmonic stenosis or subaortic stenosis. Materials and Methods Retrospective multi-investigator study of dogs with pulmonic stenosis or subaortic stenosis. Murmur intensity, assessed by a four-level classification scheme, was compared with echocardiographically-determined pressure gradient across the affected valve. Breeds represented by at least 10 dogs at any murmur intensity were compared to determine the effect, if any, of breed. Results A total of 1088 dogs (520 with pulmonic stenosis and 568 with subaortic stenosis, representing 106 breeds and the mixed breed group) were included; 208 dogs had soft, 210 had moderate, 283 had loud and 387 had palpable murmurs. Fifteen breeds were represented by at least 10 dogs: five breeds with at least 10 dogs had soft murmurs (132 dogs), nine breeds had moderate murmurs (149 dogs), 10 breeds had loud murmurs (188 dogs), and 11 breeds had palpable murmurs (286 dogs). No breeds differed in stenosis severity from any other breeds within any murmur grade. Post hoc power calculations suggested that we would have been able to detect at least a moderate or large effect size, had one existed. Several dogs with soft murmurs had more-than-mild disease severity. Clinical Significance Despite anecdotally perceived differences in the detection of heart murmurs between breeds, which have been proposed to potentially affect the interpretation of stenosis severity, we found no obvious breed effect in the ability to predict severity of stenosis.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Abstract This article outlines the over-pruning hypothesis of autism. The hypothesis originates in a neurocomputational model of the regressive sub-type (Thomas, Knowland  and which show how unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD may differ from controls either by inheriting a milder version of the pathological mechanism or by co-inheriting the risk factors without the pathological mechanism. The proposed atypical mechanism involves overly aggressive synaptic pruning in infancy and early childhood, an exaggeration of a normal phase of brain development. We show how the hypothesis generates novel predictions that differ from existing theories of ASD including that (1) the first few months of development in ASD will be indistinguishable from typical, and (2) the earliest atypicalities in ASD will be sensory and motor rather than social. Both predictions gain cautious support from emerging longitudinal studies of infants at-risk of ASD. We review evidence consistent with the over-pruning hypothesis, its relation to other current theories (including C. Frith's under-pruning proposal; C. Frith, 2003, 2004), as well as inconsistent data and current limitations. The hypothesis situates causal accounts of ASD within a framework of protective and risk factors (Newschaffer et al., 2012); clarifies different versions of the broader autism phenotype (i.e. the implication of observed similarities between individuals with autism and their family members); and integrates data from multiple disciplines, including behavioural studies, neuroscience studies, genetics, and intervention studies.

AB  - Objectives To identify the incidence, risk factors and presenting signs of lymphoma in dogs presenting to primary-care practice in the UK using analysis of data within the VetCompass? programme. Materials and Methods Case records from the VetCompass? programme from primary-care practices in the UK were searched for newly diagnosed lymphoma in dogs within a 1-year period: 2013. Diagnosis was based on clinical records with or without laboratory confirmation. Signalment was evaluated as risk factors for lymphoma diagnosis using multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 286 presumed newly diagnosed cases identified during 2013 from 455,553 dogs (overall incidence risk 63 of 100,000 dogs per year) of which 193 (67%) were laboratory confirmed (42 of 100,000 dogs per year). Advanced age, dogs older than 12?years, dogs weighing more than 30?kg and some specific breeds were significantly associated with lymphoma diagnosis. Only 18 dogs (6%) of the population identified were referred to a specialist clinic. Clinical Significance This study concurs with others that age, bodyweight and breed are significant risk factors for lymphoma. Results of this study highlight: (1) the low number of dogs with lymphoma that are referred to specialists in the UK and (2) that few dogs undergo immunophenotyping (which can carry prognostic importance), emphasising the importance of epidemiological programmes that evaluate diseases presented to primary-care veterinarians.

AB  - Objectives The aims of this study were to determine whether murmur intensity in adult dogs with pulmonic stenosis or subaortic stenosis reflects echocardiographic disease severity and to determine whether a six-level murmur grading scheme provides clinical advantages over a four-level scheme. Materials and Methods In this retrospective multi-investigator study on adult dogs with pulmonic stenosis or subaortic stenosis, murmur intensity was compared to echocardiographically determined pressure gradient across the affected valve. Disease severity, based on pressure gradients, was assessed between sequential murmur grades to identify redundancy in classification. A simplified four-level murmur intensity classification scheme (?soft?, ?moderate?, ?loud?, ?palpable?) was evaluated. Results In total, 284 dogs (153 with pulmonic stenosis, 131 with subaortic stenosis) were included; 55 dogs had soft, 59 had moderate, 72 had loud and 98 had palpable murmurs. 95 dogs had mild stenosis, 46 had moderate stenosis, and 143 had severe stenosis. No dogs with soft murmurs of either pulmonic or subaortic stenosis had transvalvular pressure gradients greater than 50 mmHg. Dogs with loud or palpable murmurs mostly, but not always, had severe stenosis. Stenosis severity increased with increasing murmur intensity. The traditional six-level murmur grading scheme provided no additional clinical information than the four-level descriptive murmur grading scheme. Clinical Significance A simplified descriptive four-level murmur grading scheme differentiated stenosis severity without loss of clinical information, compared to the traditional six-level scheme. Soft murmurs in dogs with pulmonic or subaortic stenosis are strongly indicative of mild lesions. Loud or palpable murmurs are strongly suggestive of severe stenosis.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study The most prevalent type of equine dental pulpitis due to apical infection is not associated with coronal fractures or periodontal disease. The pathogenesis of this type of pulpitis is not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used to investigate equine dental disorders. However, gross, tomographic and histopathological changes in equine dental pulpitis have not been compared previously. Objectives To compare gross, CT and histological appearances of sectioned mandibular cheek teeth extracted from horses with clinical signs of pulpitis without coronal fractures or periodontal disease. To contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of equine dental pulpitis. Study design Descriptive study using diseased and healthy teeth. Methods Mandibular cheek teeth extracted from horses with clinical signs of pulpitis (cases), and from cadavers with no history of dental disease (controls), were compared using CT in the transverse plane at 1?mm intervals. Teeth were then sectioned transversely, photographed and processed for histopathological examination. Tomographs were compared with corresponding gross and histological sections. Results Cement, dentine and bone had similar ranges of attenuation (550?2000 Hounsfield Units, HU) in tomographs but could be differentiated from pulp (-400 to 500 HU) and enamel (> 2500 HU). Twelve discrete dental lesions were identified grossly, 10 of which were characterised histologically. Reactive and reparative dentinogenesis and extensive pulpar mineralisation, previously undescribed, were identified. Pulpar oedema, neutrophilic inflammation, cement and enamel defects, and reactive cemental deposition were also observed. The CT and pathological findings corresponded well where there was mineralised tissue deposited, defects in mineralised tissue, or food material in the pulpar area. Pulpar and dentinal necrosis and cement destruction, evident grossly and histologically, did not correspond to CT changes. Conclusions Computed tomography is useful for identifying deposition and defects of mineralised material but less useful for identifying inflammation and tissue destruction. The equine dentine-pulp complex responds to insult with reactive and reparative changes.

AB  - Summary Thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is necessary in order to open new avenues for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize the CD4+ T cell population and evaluate their activation and polarization status in OA joints. Fifty-five patients with end-stage knee OA (Kellgren?Lawrence grades III?IV) who underwent surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were enrolled into this study. Matched samples of synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were analysed for CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets [T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells] and activation status (CD25, CD69, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD62L) by flow cytometry. Subset-specific cytokines were analysed by cytometric bead array (CBA). SM and SF samples showed a distinct infiltration pattern of CD4+ T cells. In comparison to PB, a higher amount of joint-derived T cells was polarized into CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets, with the most significant increase for proinflammatory Th1 cells in SF. CBA analysis revealed significantly increased immunomodulating cytokines [interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10] in SF compared to PB. Whereas in PB only a small proportion of CD4+ T cells were activated, the majority of joint-derived CD4+ T cells can be characterized as activated effector memory cells (CD69+CD45RO+CD62L?). End-stage OA knees are characterized by an increased CD4+ T cell polarization towards activated Th1 cells and cytokine secretion compared to PB. This local inflammation may contribute to disease aggravation and eventually perpetuate the disease process.

AB  - Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are perceived to have a high mortality when admitted to the Critical Care Unit (CCU). We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult sickle admissions to CCU at a single centre over an 8-year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2007). Thirty-eight patients (14 male) were admitted 46 times to CCU; the commonest reasons for admission were acute chest syndrome (14, 30%), multi-organ failure (8, 17%) and planned post-elective surgery (7, 15%). CCU mortality for SCD patients was 19·6%, comparable to a CCU-wide mortality of 17·6% during the study period in the same institution. Re-admission to CCU was high (16% over the 8-year period) but did not increase mortality risk.

AB  - A five-year-old, male crossbreed rabbit was referred for acute caudal abdominal swelling. On physical examination, the rabbit was slightly depressed and showed an enlarged subcutaneous cyst in the caudal abdomen and an adjacent small, ulcerated solid mass. A drainage tube was placed in the cystic area, and surgical resection of the solid mass was performed. The histopathological diagnosis of the mass was apocrine adenocarcinoma. To the authors? knowledge, this report describes the first case of spontaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma of possible sweat gland origin in a male rabbit.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.
