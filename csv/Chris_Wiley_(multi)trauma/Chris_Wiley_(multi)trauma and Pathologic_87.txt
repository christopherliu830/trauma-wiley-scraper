AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - Deep learning is one of the most exciting new areas in medical imaging. This review article provides a summary of the current clinical applications of deep learning for lesion detection, progression, and prediction of musculoskeletal disease on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine. Deep-learning methods have shown success for estimating pediatric bone age, detecting fractures, and assessing the severity of osteoarthritis on radiographs. In particular, the high diagnostic performance of deep-learning approaches for estimating pediatric bone age and detecting fractures suggests that the new technology may soon become available for use in clinical practice. Recent studies have also documented the feasibility of using deep-learning methods for identifying a wide variety of pathologic abnormalities on CT and MRI including internal derangement, metastatic disease, infection, fractures, and joint degeneration. However, the detection of musculoskeletal disease on CT and especially MRI is challenging, as it often requires analyzing complex abnormalities on multiple slices of image datasets with different tissue contrasts. Thus, additional technical development is needed to create deep-learning methods for reliable and repeatable interpretation of musculoskeletal CT and MRI examinations. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of all deep-learning methods for detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal disease must be evaluated in prospective studies using large image datasets acquired at different institutions with different imaging parameters and different imaging hardware before they can be implemented in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Seven cases of mucinous ovarian tumors with sarcoma-like nodules in their walls are reported. The age of the patients ranged from 18?81 years. Each of them had a large abdominal mass which proved on exploration to be a Stage la cystic ovarian tumor. All the specimens contained one or more discrete nodules in their walls, most of which were soft, dark brown, and hemorrhagic. On microscopical examination the epithelial component of four of the tumors was of borderline malignancy and of three was well-differentiated carcinoma. Three patterns were encountered in the nodules: pleomorphic and epulis-like in four cases, pleomorphic and spindle-celled in one case, and giant cellhistiocytic in two cases. These patterns simulated those of malignant giant cell tumor of soft parts, spindle cell sarcoma, and well-differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, respectively. Postoperative follow-up ranging from 1 to 111/2 years (average, 71/2 years) revealed no evidence of recurrence. Reports of seven similar tumors were found in the literature. Although follow-up has been less complete in these cases, none of the tumors is known to have spread beyond the ovary. These data suggest that mural nodules of the types described are not sarcomatous but could represent a reactive process that has no effect on the prognosis of the patient.

AB  - A five-year-old, male crossbreed rabbit was referred for acute caudal abdominal swelling. On physical examination, the rabbit was slightly depressed and showed an enlarged subcutaneous cyst in the caudal abdomen and an adjacent small, ulcerated solid mass. A drainage tube was placed in the cystic area, and surgical resection of the solid mass was performed. The histopathological diagnosis of the mass was apocrine adenocarcinoma. To the authors? knowledge, this report describes the first case of spontaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma of possible sweat gland origin in a male rabbit.

AB  - Widespread expression of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), which maintains redox homeostasis, has recently been identified in the hair follicle (HF). Small molecule activators of NRF2 may therefore be useful in the management of HF pathologies associated with redox imbalance, ranging from HF greying and HF ageing via androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata to chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Indeed, NRF2 activation has been shown to prevent peroxide-induced hair growth inhibition. Multiple parameters can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species in the HF, for example melanogenesis, depilation-induced trauma, neurogenic and autoimmune inflammation, toxic drugs, environmental stressors such as UV irradiation, genetic defects and aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, the potential mechanisms whereby NRF2 activation could prove beneficial in treatment of redox-associated HF disorders are therefore discussed.

Although no underlying structural heart disease was apparent antemortem or on gross post-mortem examination, chronic atrial myocarditis was seen on histopathological examination. Atrial myocarditis is a recognised cause of atrial fibrillation in human beings with presumed lone fibrillation, and an association between supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and infectious agents has been made.

AB  - Summary Bright green inclusions in neutrophils have been reported as a sign of impending patient death. Here we report a series of 20 patients in whom green inclusions were identified in neutrophils or monocytes. Thirteen (65%) of the patients died within days of the detection of the inclusions. A common feature to almost all patients was ischaemic or hypoxic hepatitis which, in fatal cases, was associated with lactic acidosis. Light and electron microscopy indicated that the inclusions were lipid-rich, probably derived from lipofuscin-like material released from necrotic liver parenchymal cells. The majority of patients were known to be seriously ill at the time of detection of neutrophil inclusions. We recommend that the detection of green inclusions, which we refer to as ?critical green inclusions?, is acknowledged and reported by laboratories and correlated with clinical findings.

AB  - Summary Almost half of the nail pathology is due to onychomycosis, but as the nail has a limited repertoire of clinical expressions, many nail conditions may mimic onychomycosis. Its differential diagnosis should be known in order to avoid useless or even potentially toxic treatments. Clinical features of the most common type of onychomycosis, namely distal subungual lateral onychomycosis (DSLO), are subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and yellowish discoloration of the nail plate. In psoriasis involving the distal matrix, the incorporation of parakeratotic cells in the nail plate may result in leukonychia, which should be distinguished from superficial white onychomycosis (SWO). In some special features of proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), the nail exhibits one or several white transverse lines. Total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) is a long-standing condition where the nail was contaminated and became progressively dystrophic. Clinical examination and a thorough history of patients are usually sufficient for establishing the right diagnosis.

AB  - Diagnostic concordance of intraepithelial malignancy is generally only fair. Because the diagnosis of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma is not uniform and because such terms are not consonant with the nomenclature of other human epithelial malignancies, nomenclature revisions have been attempted. One hundred dermatopathologists were solicited to review 15 tissue sections representing a spectrum of varying thickness epidermal malignancy and to choose either actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma as the diagnosis. Among the 77 participating dermatopathologists intraclass correlation was high for what was perceived as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and their differentiation. Development of a two-tiered diagnostic system that retains our present diagnostic capabilities, but better fits the pathobiology of superficial epidermal malignancy is suggested.

AB  - Introduction Degenerative changes in sacroiliac joints (SIJ) are reported to cause poor performance in horses. The aim of this study was to document the frequency and nature of changes in SIJ surfaces of Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses and to correlate gross morphology and marginal new bone formation to age, body weight and history of back pain. Methods SIJ surfaces from 37 deceased TBs retired from the Hong Kong Jockey Club were photographed and measurements taken to facilitate subjective and objective analysis of gross changes. SIJ surfaces were described, and the surface area of the joint surfaces determined from the photographs, using Image J. Area and shape of the joint surfaces were recorded and SIJs were graded and allocated a type according to pre-determined criteria. Changes were compared for horses with and without clinical records of back pain. Results Mean age was 6.6?±?2.3 years; weight 494?±?35?kg; with no differences between horses with (n?=?14) and without (n?=?23) a history of back pain. There was no relationship between bodyweight (r?=?0.08) or age (r?=?0.13) and SIJ surface area. SIJs of the back pain group were affected by obvious gross pathology that showed certain characteristics. There was a relationship between surface area of joint and degree of marginal bone formation (P<0.001). SIJs from the group of TBs with no back pain had fewer and less obvious gross findings. Conclusions Clinical evidence of back pain, which may reasonably be expected to have affected the horse's racing performance, was associated with characteristic gross pathology of the SIJ. Ethical Animal Research Ethical approval for animal use was obtained by the institutional animal ethics committee (University of Queensland) and Hong Kong ethics committee. The study was performed on material collected during post-mortem examination. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Abstract The repetitive nature of throwing manifests characteristic adaptive changes to the shoulder, scapulothoracic, and hip/pelvis complexes that result in a set of unique physical traits in the overhead throwing athlete. An effective rehabilitation program is dependent upon an accurate evaluation and differential diagnosis to determine the causative factors for the athlete's pathologic features. The treatment program should be individualized with specific strengthening and flexibility exercises to achieve the dynamic stability that is required for overhead function. In this article we describe the characteristics of the throwing shoulder, along with a multiphased rehabilitation program that allows for the restoration of strength, mobility, endurance, and power and is aimed toward a return to unrestricted sporting activity. We also describe exercises that link the upper and lower extremities because of the importance of core control and leg strength in the development of power during the act of throwing. Additionally, proper throwing mechanics, utilization of pitch counts, appropriate rest, and proper off-season conditioning will help decrease overall injury risk in the overhead throwing athlete.

AB  - An account is given of the pathology and incidence of spontaneous arterial disease occurring in a series of about 2000 vertebrates, the majority of which died in captivity from natural causes. The personal observations are integrated with a fairly detailed review of the literature. Vascular lesions have been described in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Particular attention is given in this paper to the comparative pathology of degenerative arterial disease and, more especially, atherosclerosis. Minor degrees of lipid infiltration of the arterial wall are seen commonly in many avian and mammalian orders, but more advanced atheromatous plaques occur frequently only in some avian orders and man. Atheroma has been observed occasionally in sub-human primates and ungulates. Focal degeneration and calcification of the arterial media constitute the major arterial lesion in ungulates and marsupials; parasitic arteritides are seen principally in carnivores, equines and, possibly, reptiles. Arterial thrombosis in animals is usually secondary to local physical injury or infection; occlusive atherothrombosis is extremely rare in all animals. A hypothesis is presented on the histogenesis of atherosclerosis as it occurs in animals. It is concluded that the condition is a multifactorial disease. The role of dietary and other factors which may play a part in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is discussed. Age is the only factor shown to be fairly directly related to atherosclerosis, but the almost complete absence of lesions in some comparatively old animals emphasizes that atheroma is not an inevitable accompaniment of senescence. The morphological pattern of arterial disease would appear to be similar in free-living and captive animals; and though increasing age and the conditions of captivity may potentiate lesions, it would seem likely that the primary causes of arterial disease are operative in natural, quasi-natural or captive environments.

Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland revealed an enlarged left lobe, which, on cytological examination, contained numerous anaplastic cells. A mixed C cell microfollicular thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed following histopathological examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. In order to determine metastasis, pulmonary radiographs revealed a poorly-marginated soft tissue opacity caudo-dorsal to the cardiac silhouette. Thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy was performed comparing 99mTc-sestamibi with 99mTc-pertechnetate and no metastasis was detectable. Following hemithyroidectomy, the stallion made a full recovery without the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Six months later, repeated thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy using 99mTc-sestamibi was normal.

AB  - Abstract Liver transplantation is currently the only effective therapy for patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The availability of an artificial liver could bridge these patients through the relatively brief crisis period and allow their own livers to regenerate, providing a more favorable outcome and sparing the trauma and expense of transplant. We have developed a device consisting of a highly differentiated human liver cell line cultured in a hollow fiber cartridge. This device is capable of supporting dogs with acetaminopheninduced fulminant hepatic failure for a period long enough for their own livers to resume function. Even though liver function tests such as albumin and prothrombin time became extremely abnormal during the course of the experiment, the dogs did not become encephalopathic. Two of the three treated animals recovered sufficient liver function after 42 to 48 hr of treatment that they could be disconnected from the device, and they survived the experiment. Histological results and serum ALT levels suggest that the device affected the course of the disease in two animals, allowing recovery of hepatocytes that would otherwise have lysed. In the third animal, regenerative nodules demonstrated that, even in the presence of severe liver injury, the device was capable of supporting total liver function. (HEPATOLOGY 1992;16:60?65.)

AB  - Abstract This review discusses aspects of known and putative compartmentalized 3?,5?-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling in astrocytes, a cell type that has turned out to be a key player in brain physiology and pathology. cAMP has attracted less attention than Ca2+ in recent years, but could turn out to rival Ca2+ in its potential to drive cellular functions and responses to intra? and extracellular cues. Further, Ca2+ and cAMP are known to engage in extensive crosstalk and cAMP signals often take place within subcellular compartments revolving around multi-protein signaling complexes; however, we know surprisingly little about this in astrocytes. Here, we review aspects of astrocytic cAMP signaling, provide arguments for an increased interest in this subject, suggest possible future research directions within the field, and discuss putative drug targets.

This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

A 27-year-old man was injured during military service by an improvised explosive device, resulting in bilateral through-the-knee amputations, left hand deformity, and a segmental left ulnar defect. After unsuccessful ulnar reconstruction with nonvascularized autologous bone and allograft bone substitutes, he presented to our institution. We removed the residual allograft fragments from the ulnar defect, harvested a vascularized left sixth rib with the intercostal artery and vein, secured the construct with internal hardware, and performed microanastomoses of the intercostal artery and vein to the posterior interosseous artery and vein. Postoperatively, he had a hematoma at the vascularized graft recipient site caused by anticoagulation therapy for his chronic deep vein thrombosis. Despite this, the rib graft successfully incorporated on the basis of radiographic and clinical examinations at 27 months. He had no pain and good function of the arm. The results of this case suggest that a vascularized rib graft for forearm reconstruction may be a viable option with minimal donor site morbidity. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Ultrasound examination of the gastrointestinal tract of the dog and cat is challenging. In this article, a brief description of the indications for gastrointestinal ultrasound, patient preparation, ultrasound terminology and common artefacts is followed by a description with illustrations of the anatomy and normal ultrasound appearance of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocolic junction and colon. A description of how to find each part of the gastrointestinal tract is given. A second paper will describe and illustrate common pathological conditions, including gastrointestinal foreign bodies, intussusception, neoplasia and inflammatory disease.
