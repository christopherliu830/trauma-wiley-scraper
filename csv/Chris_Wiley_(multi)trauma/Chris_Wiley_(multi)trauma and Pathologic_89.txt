AB  - Background: Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) by radiofrequency (RF) ablation is often performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Current catheter technology usually requires the use of a multielectrode catheter for mapping in addition to the ablation catheter. Purpose: We evaluated the feasibility and safety of using a single, expandable electrode catheter (MESH) to map and to electrically isolate the PV. Methods and Results: Nineteen closed-chest mongrel dogs, weighing 23?35 kg, were studied under general anesthesia. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was used to guide transseptal puncture and to assess PV dimensions and contact of the MESH with PV ostia. ICE and angiography of RSPV were obtained before and after ablation, and prior to sacrifice at 7?99 days. An 11.5 Fr steerable MESH was advanced and deployed at the ostium of the RSPV. Recordings were obtained via the 36 electrodes comprising the MESH. For circumferential ablation, RF current was delivered at a target temperature of 62?65°C (4 thermocouples) and maximum power of 70?100 W for 180 to 300 seconds. Each animal received 1?4 RF applications. Entrance conduction block was obtained in 13/19 treated RSPVs. Pathological examination confirmed circumferential and transmural lesions in 13 of 19 RSPV. LA mural thrombus was present in 3 animals. There was no significant PV stenosis. Conclusion: Based on this canine model, a new expandable MESH catheter may safely be used for mapping and for PV antrum isolation. This approach may decrease procedure time without compromising success rate in patients undergoing AF ablation.

AB  - Objective: To report clinical findings and outcome in dogs and cats undergoing choledochotomy or primary repair of extrahepatic biliary duct rupture. Methods: Retrospective study of dogs (n=7) and cats (n=2) that had choledochotomy or primary bile duct repair. Results: Extrahepatic biliary obstruction was confirmed at surgery in all cases. The underlying cause in four dogs and both cats was choledocholithiasis, two dogs had gall bladder mucocoeles with associated bile duct rupture, and one dog had inspissated bile obstructing the bile duct secondary to gall bladder carcinoid tumour. Three dogs and both cats had choledochotomies performed to relieve extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and four dogs with bile duct rupture underwent primary repair of the defect. One dog with a bile duct rupture was re-explored four days postoperatively and had suffered dehiscence of the repair; this rupture was re-repaired. All animals were discharged from the hospital, and did not have clinical recurrence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Clinical Significance: Choledochotomy and primary repair of extrahepatic biliary duct rupture were associated with low perioperative morbidity and no mortality in this small cohort of cases. These techniques are reasonable options either alone or in conjunction with other procedures when bile duct patency cannot be re-established by catheterisation or bile duct discontinuity exists.

Among these, replacement of the injured neural and paraneural tissues via cellular transplantation of neural and mesenchymal stem cells has been the most attractive. Extensive experimental studies have been done to identify the safety and effectiveness of this transplantation in animal and human models. Herein, we review the literature for studies conducted, with a focus on the human-related studies, recruitment, isolation, and transplantation, of these multipotent stem cells, and associated outcomes.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Abstract Red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies are a relatively uncommon cause of anemia. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemias, especially if the patient has a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral or mycoplasmal infection. Classifications of AIHA include warm AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed-type AIHA, and drug-induced AIHA. Characteristics of the autoantibodies are responsible for the various clinical entities. As a result, diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and a serologic work-up. For each classification of AIHA, this review discusses the demographics, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options. Am. J.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses the nature of disability, how it can best be ameliorated, which training techniques and medical treatments are most effective, particularly after single incident brain injury, and the organisational structures required for their optimal delivery. A holistic biopsychosocial individualised multi-dimensional rehabilitation programme includes: reiterative multi-disciplinary assessment, problem definition and measurement, goal-setting and treatment planning, treatment delivery, evaluation of effectiveness, and reassessment with a view to further treatment. Non-invasive therapy interventions and task-related training in the context of neural damage are an integral part of the rehabilitation process after a neurological event, and aim to optimise a person's functional ability. Cardio-respiratory training and exercise classes may reverse the detraining effects of immobility and reduced activity seen in many chronic conditions. Symptoms related to neurological impairments caused by either single incident or chronic progressive conditions can cause distress and impact on function.

AB  - Abstract Background. Distraction osteogenesis is an established technique for the lengthening of long bones and correction of selected craniofacial deformities. Regenerate osteoid bone matrix formed during the distraction phase is malleable and can recreate the three-dimensional form of native bones. Animal experiments and early clinical experience have confirmed that distraction osteogenesis can be used for the reconstruction of segmental bony defects. Herein we discuss the principles of distraction osteogenesis in reference to reconstruction of segmental bony defects and report its clinical application of the mandible continuity defects. Patients and Methods. Four patients (age, 7?83 years) with critical segmental mandibular defects (range, 3.5 cm?6.5 cm), resulting from ablative oncologic head and neck surgery underwent primary mandibular reconstruction by transport distraction osteogenesis. Two defects were at the angle and body region, one at the body, and the other at the parasymphysis and body region. Synthes Titanium Multi-vector and Leibinger Multi-guide distractors in bifocal (n = 2) and trifocal (n = 2) architecture were used after the stabilization of the segmental continuity defect using a defect-bridging mandibular reconstruction plate. Osteodistraction was carried out at a rate of 1 mm per day, with once or twice a day rhythm, after a 1-week latency period. The consolidation period was equal to the period of distraction. Results. All patients tolerated the distraction procedure. Satisfactory bone formation was observed in two patients, and partial bone formation was seen in one patient. Treatment failure was encountered in one patient who had a second oral cavity primary tumor observed during the consolidation period, requiring interruption of the treatment sequence. Conclusions. Mandibular reconstruction with distraction osteogenesis is a potentially useful technique in selected patients with segmental mandibular continuity defects after ablative head and neck cancer surgery. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aims The present study aimed at examining neuronal injury and repair in post mortem brain sections of humans who died from fungal central nervous system infections. Methods Histological and immunohistochemical abnormalities in 15 autopsy cases with fungal central nervous system infections from 1990 to 2008 were compared with findings in 10 age- und sex-matched control cases that died from acute non-neurological causes. The fungal pathogens were identified by culture or polymerase chain reaction and morphology in post mortem tissue. Seven patients with fungal encephalitis had either an organ transplantation or a malignant haematological disorder; five out of 15 did not have a classical predisposing illness but suffered from severe septic infections as the principal cause of immunosuppression, and three from alcoholism. Results Fungal organisms detected were Aspergillus spp. and other moulds, Candida spp. and black yeast-like fungi including Cladosporium spp. Histological analyses identified microglial activation, astrocytosis and axonal injury in the white matter without additional demyelination as characteristic features of this infectious disease. An increased rate of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was detected in fungal encephalitis, while the number of recently generated TUC-4 and calretinin-expressing neurones in the dentate gyrus did not differ between patients and controls. Conclusions Unlike in other infectious diseases of the nervous system where a coexistence of damage and repair was observed, fungal encephalitis is characterized by strong damage and minimal neuronal regeneration.

AB  - Diffusion imaging has been instrumental in understanding damage to the central nervous system as a result of its sensitivity to microstructural changes. Clinical applications of diffusion imaging have grown exponentially over the past couple of decades in many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). For several reasons, MS has been extensively researched using advanced neuroimaging techniques, which makes it an ?example disease? to illustrate the potential of diffusion imaging for clinical applications. In addition, MS pathology is characterized by several key processes competing with each other, such as inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, gliosis and axonal loss, enabling the specificity of diffusion to be challenged. In this review, we describe how diffusion imaging can be exploited to investigate micro-, meso- and macro-scale properties of the brain structure and discuss how they are affected by different pathological substrates. Conclusions from the literature are that larger studies are needed to confirm the exciting results from initial investigations before current trends in diffusion imaging can be translated to the neurology clinic. Also, for a comprehensive understanding of pathological processes, it is essential to take a multiple-level approach, in which information at the micro-, meso- and macroscopic scales is fully integrated.

AB  - Abstract Chronic post-operative pain is a major source of suffering and disability. Better standardisation for assessing and reporting chronic post-operative pain is needed. Peripheral and central nervous plasticity seem to play a major role in the development of chronic post-injury pain. Complex mechanisms, including several receptor systems and messenger systems are involved. Thus, it is unlikely that one single agent will solve the problem. Opioids have proven effect both in animal models, experimental human models, and in some clinical models. Timing and dose seem to be of importance. However, it is likely that polypharmacy and multi-modal treatment is necessary to further improve the preventive strategy.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT Long-term administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can induce detrimental side effects such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in human. Although inflammation is known to be associated with BRONJ development, the detailed underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36α is, in part, responsible for the BRONJ development. We found a notably higher level of IL-36α and lower level of collagen in the BRONJ lesions in mice. We also found that IL-36α remarkably suppressed TGF-?-mediated expression of Collα1 and α-Sma via the activation of Erk signaling pathway in mouse gingival mesenchymal stem cells. When IL-36 signaling was abrogated in vivo, development of BRONJ lesions was ameliorated in mice. Taken together, we showed the pathologic role of IL-36α in BRONJ development by inhibiting collagen expression and demonstrated that IL-36α could be a potential marker and a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of BRONJ. ? 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract When a patient receiving anti-cancer treatment presents acutely unwell, an understanding of associated side effects of their therapy is critical. This review will discuss the approach to patients receiving anti-cancer treatment with immunotherapy presenting with autoimmune toxicities in the emergency setting. These toxicities are commonly referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAE). IrAE might consist of, but are not limited to, dermatologic, gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, colitis), hepatic, endocrine (thyroid dysfunction, hypophysitis, adrenal crisis), renal, ocular and pulmonary toxicity. General principles of managing these irAE in the acute setting will be outlined. Steroid therapy is a critical component of the treatment algorithm, being administered at high doses and for prolonged periods to switch off immune over-activation. Prompt intervention might prevent multi-organ failure and fatality, and allow patients to remain on effective anti-cancer therapy.

AB  - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is commonly seen in dogs and cats and presents a spectrum of disease severities from acute to chronic and mild to severe. It is usually sterile, but the causes and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. The acute end of the disease spectrum is associated with a high mortality but the potential for complete recovery of organ structure and function if the animal survives. At the other end of the spectrum, chronic pancreatitis in either species can cause refractory pain and reduce quality of life. It may also result in progressive exocrine and endocrine functional impairment. There is confusion in the veterinary literature about definitions of acute and chronic pancreatitis and there are very few studies on the pathophysiology of naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs and cats. This article reviews histological and clinical definitions and current understanding of the pathophysiology and causes in small animals by comparison with the much more extensive literature in humans, and suggests many areas that need further study in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.

AB  - Abstract Aims:? Many papers postulate treatments for established bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) or advise on ideal long-term strategies to avoid BRONJ. This article demonstrates prophylactic regimes and compares their outcomes when patients' acute symptoms demand active treatments involving bone. It assesses the efficacy of the protocols developed at Dundee Dental Hospital for prophylaxis of BRONJ in the management of patients undergoing oral surgery. Materials and methods:? This prospective study tracked the progress of patients who were treated in the exodontia clinics and had taken, or were taking bisphosphonates. Their consequent recovery was documented over 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. The prophylactic protocol followed was recorded. These data were then reviewed for healing, operator, jaw predilection and co-morbidity influences. Results:? In total, 25 patients were treated over the 1 year period of the study 2008?09. This amounted to 33 oral surgery treatments involving 64 extractions. Several protocols had been followed however these were grouped into: antimicrobial or chlorhexidine based protocols. In all cases, complete healing was achieved. Concomitant steroid use and increasing age were the only associated co-morbidities that increased the length of healing time. There were no direct associations of any of the other variables with healing. No prophylactic protocol was superior to another with chlorhexidine rinses proving as efficacious as any of the antibiotic regimes. Conclusion:? For patients taking oral bisphosphonates, simple extractions carried out with minimal trauma by graduate and supervised undergraduate operators with prophylactic chlorhexidine rinses, heal as satisfactorily as those with antibiotic based protocols for prophylaxis.
