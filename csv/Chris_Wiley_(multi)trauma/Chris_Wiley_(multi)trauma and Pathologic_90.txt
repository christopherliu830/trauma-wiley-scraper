AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?The World Class Development Programme is funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, through Exchequer and National Lottery funds, via UK Sport.

AB  - Background? It is estimated that skin cancers cost $33 million per annum to the New Zealand healthcare system. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the commonest types of non melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Anecdotal evidence indicates that there has been a doubling in the incidence of NMSCs in New Zealand over the last decade. Because of the high incidence mandatory reporting of NMSCs to the National Cancer Registry is not required. This lack of accurate data has led to poor health care policies and strategies including funding and workforce planning. Aims? The aims of this study are to (1) present the latest statistics on NMSCs in New Zealand, including the incidence across different regions over the last decade, patient demographics, anatomic distribution of NMSCs, incidence and sites of metastasis, and disease-specific survival; to (2) the histopathology of NMSCs, including surgical margins, histologic grade, and perineural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion; and (3) the relative role of different faculties treating NMSCs. Method? This project has been approved by the multi-centre ethics committee. A retrospective review was conducted from patients? histology records from public and private pathology laboratories within defined catchment areas. Criterion for analysis is a confirmed diagnosis of NMSC treated surgically. A Microsoft Access database is created that will facilitate subsequent data retrieval and analysis. Results and Conclusion? It is hoped that this up-to-date data will form the framework for the development of sound and sustainable healthcare policies of management of NMSCs including management strategies and workforce planning, and research direction on this common disease.

AB  - Abstract Aims:? Many papers postulate treatments for established bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) or advise on ideal long-term strategies to avoid BRONJ. This article demonstrates prophylactic regimes and compares their outcomes when patients' acute symptoms demand active treatments involving bone. It assesses the efficacy of the protocols developed at Dundee Dental Hospital for prophylaxis of BRONJ in the management of patients undergoing oral surgery. Materials and methods:? This prospective study tracked the progress of patients who were treated in the exodontia clinics and had taken, or were taking bisphosphonates. Their consequent recovery was documented over 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. The prophylactic protocol followed was recorded. These data were then reviewed for healing, operator, jaw predilection and co-morbidity influences. Results:? In total, 25 patients were treated over the 1 year period of the study 2008?09. This amounted to 33 oral surgery treatments involving 64 extractions. Several protocols had been followed however these were grouped into: antimicrobial or chlorhexidine based protocols. In all cases, complete healing was achieved. Concomitant steroid use and increasing age were the only associated co-morbidities that increased the length of healing time. There were no direct associations of any of the other variables with healing. No prophylactic protocol was superior to another with chlorhexidine rinses proving as efficacious as any of the antibiotic regimes. Conclusion:? For patients taking oral bisphosphonates, simple extractions carried out with minimal trauma by graduate and supervised undergraduate operators with prophylactic chlorhexidine rinses, heal as satisfactorily as those with antibiotic based protocols for prophylaxis.

AB  - Background Hospitalization-based estimates of trends in injury incidence are also affected by trends in health care practices and payer coverage that may differentially impact minor injuries. This study assessed whether implementing a severity threshold would improve occupational injury surveillance. Methods Hospital discharge data from four states and a national survey were used to identify traumatic injuries (1998?2009). Negative binomial regression was used to model injury trends with/without severity restriction, and to test trend divergence by severity. Results Trend estimates were generally biased downward in the absence of severity restriction, more so for occupational than non-occupational injuries. Restriction to severe injuries provided a markedly different overall picture of trends. Conclusions Severity restriction may improve occupational injury trend estimates by reducing temporal biases such as increasingly restrictive hospital admission practices, constricting workers' compensation coverage, and decreasing identification/reporting of minor work-related injuries. Injury severity measures should be developed for occupational injury surveillance systems. Am. J. Ind. Med. 57:928?939, 2014. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Abstract In general, veterinary dermatologists do not have extensive clinical experience of nonhuman primate (NHP) dermatoses. The bulk of the published literature does not provide an organized evidence-based approach to the NHP dermatologic case. The veterinary dermatologist is left to extract information from both human and veterinary dermatology, an approach that can be problematic as it forces the clinician to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions based on two very disparate bodies of literature. A more cohesive approach to NHP dermatology ? without relying on assumptions that NHP pathology most commonly behaves similarly to other veterinary and human disease ? is required. This review of the dermatology of NHP species includes discussions of primary dermatoses, as well as diseases where dermatologic signs represent a significant secondary component, provides a first step towards encouraging the veterinary community to study and report the dermatologic diseases of nonhuman primates.

AB  - Abstract Neovascularization or angiogenesis is an essential yet poorly understood component of the healing process. In wound healing research, there is a lack of models enabling quantitative and continuous measurements of wound neovascul-arization. The hairless mouse ear wound model permits quantitative measurements of wound epithelialization and neovascularization continuously throughout the healing process. On the ears of male homozygous (hr/hr) hairless mice, standardized circular full thickness dermal wounds are produced; then, using vital microscopy, these two processes are directly viewed and measured at day 0 and every third day thereafter until these are complete. This model system and its application to clinically relevant situations are reviewed. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from a self-destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (N = 5) and healthy subjects (N = 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract It is possible to discuss the role that Ca++ antagonists might provide as a therapeutic means of treating various types of cerebral dysfunction, by maintaining a dynamic homeostasis of Ca++ in brain neurons. In this paper, we will review the results of Ca++ antagonist treatments of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke, migraine, dementia, psychiatric disorders, substance abusers, Menière's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and discuss the future of Ca++ antagonists and problems in their development. Ca++ antagonists have been established as a standard therapy for SAH in the USA, but their efficacy for traumatic SAH has not been confirmed because of the pathological variability of this disease. The data on strokes have not always indicated improved outcomes. Dementia may be a disease for which Ca++ antagonists should be indicated. Many clinical studies have also suggested some effectiveness of Ca++ antagonists, but the number of patients examined was too small to draw any firm conclusions. Thus, the development of Ca++ antagonists to treat cerebral dysfunction is not as greatly advanced as would be expected. This is probably due to the fact that most of the currently used Ca++ antagonists were selected on the basis of their cardiovascular effects, but not their effects on the central nervous system. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.

The histological and ultrastructural features of the plaques are described, compared with kuru plaques and senile plaques. The comparison between Japanese CJD with kuru-like plaques and similar cases in foreign countries and their nosological problem are discussed.

AB  - Prevalence studies show that between 15 and 30% of women have been sexually abused by a man by the age of 16. Child abuse survivors rarely spontaneously reveal this history to a doctor yet they are more likely than non-abused patients to suffer multi-system medical complaints and to indulge in high-risk behaviours. This of course may make them more likely to appear in gynaecology or colposcopy clinics. It seems sensible that gynaecologists should be well informed about CSA and in particular the impact it may have on their patients so that they can offer the required sensitive treatment in an appropriate environment for these women in particular. Just as with rape the sexual component of child sexual abuse is of secondary importance to power over and manipulation of children, therefore psychological damage to children is much greater if the abuser is a parent or parent figure. Incest is most commonly between father or stepfather and daughter, with stepfathers being the worst offenders. The peculiar difficulties that follow sexual abuse of a child by a family member and which place the child in a seemingly impossible position in the family have been well-described by Summit (1983). He uses the term CSA accommodation syndrome to describe a reaction, which allows for the immediate survival of the child within the family. There are 5 components to this syndrome:- (1) Secrecy (2) Helplessness (3) Entrapment and Accommodation (4) Delayed, Conflicted and Unconvincing disclosure (5) Retraction Unfortunately these children develop multiple psychological and emotional disorders in the process e.g. depression, high anxiety and panic attacks, obsessional concerns, eating disorders and abuse of self. They may also develop physical manifestations of emotional pain such as pseudo-seizures or chronic pelvic pain. Not surprisingly, sexual problems are also common e.g. low sex drive or vaginismus. Despite the fact that abuse of children is very variable in severity, the treatment of abused women follows a recognised process which is similar in each case. Disclosure ? therapy starts from this moment so it is important that it is handled well. She is encouraged to talk about the abuse as she remembers it and it is important that her therapist lets her know that her story is believed. Responsibility for the abuse is addressed. Almost without exception, victims of abuse feel responsible in some way for what happened so again her therapist must point out where the blame really lies i.e. with the abuser. Current family relationships have to be reviewed as she may still in fact be living with the abuser and part of the healing process may involve his confrontation. Finally moving from victim to survivor the woman addresses the damage that has been done. Many women attending colposcopy or gynaecology clinics will have suffered sexual abuse. They may find the experience traumatising and will be greatly helped to cope if the environment in which they are treated is sensitive and caring.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Developed by the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD), the standardized direct observation assessment tool (SDOT) is an evaluation instrument used to assess residents? clinical skills in the emergency department (ED). In a previous study examining the inter-rater agreement of the tool, faculty scored simulated resident?patient encounters. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the inter-rater agreement of the SDOT in real-time evaluations of residents in the ED. Methods:? This was a multi-center, prospective, observational study in which faculty raters were paired to simultaneously observe and independently evaluate a resident?s clinical performance using the SDOT. Data collected from eight emergency medicine (EM) residency programs produced 99 unique resident?patient encounters and reported on 26 individual behaviors related to specific core competencies, global evaluation scores for each core competency, and an overall clinical competency score. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using percentage agreement analyses with three constructs: exact agreement, liberal agreement, and binary (pass/fail) agreement. Results:? Inter-rater agreement between faculty raters varied according to category of measure used. Exact agreement ranged from poor to good, depending on the measure: the overall competency score (good), the competency score for each of the six core competencies (poor to good), and the individual item scores (fair to very good). Liberal agreement and binary agreement were excellent for the overall competency score and the competency score for each of the six core competencies and very good to excellent for the individual item scores. Conclusions:? The SDOT demonstrated excellent inter-rater agreement when analyzed with liberal agreement and when dichotomized as a pass/fail measure and fair to good agreement for most measures with exact agreement. The SDOT can be useful and reliable when evaluating residents? clinical skills in the ED, particularly as it relates to marginal performance.
