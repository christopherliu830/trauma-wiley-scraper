AB  - Background Endoscopic skull-base surgery (ESBS) is employed in the management of diverse skull-base pathologies. Paralleling the increased utilization of ESBS, the literature in this field has expanded rapidly. However, the rarity of these diseases, the inherent challenges of surgical studies, and the continued learning curve in ESBS have resulted in significant variability in the quality of the literature. To consolidate and critically appraise the available literature, experts in skull-base surgery have produced the International Consensus Statement on Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery (ICAR:ESBS). Methods Using previously described methodology, topics spanning the breadth of ESBS were identified and assigned a literature review, evidence-based review or evidence-based review with recommendations format. Subsequently, each topic was written and then reviewed by skull-base surgeons in both neurosurgery and otolaryngology. Following this iterative review process, the ICAR:ESBS document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results The ICAR:ESBS document addresses the role of ESBS in primary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, benign skull-base and orbital pathology, sinonasal malignancies, and clival lesions. Additionally, specific challenges in ESBS including endoscopic reconstruction and complication management were evaluated. Conclusion A critical review of the literature in ESBS demonstrates at least the equivalency of ESBS with alternative approaches in pathologies such as CSF rhinorrhea and pituitary adenoma as well as improved reconstructive techniques in reducing CSF leaks. Evidence-based recommendations are limited in other pathologies and these significant knowledge gaps call upon the skull-base community to embrace these opportunities and collaboratively address these shortcomings.

AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.

The surface was lined by a nonstratified layer of plump endothelial cells. Immediately beneath lay cells and processes of pericytes rich in thin filaments with fusiform densities, resembling smooth muscle cells. Primitive mesenchymal cells were observed to lie among the pericytes. The stroma beyond the subendothelial layer was collagenous and contained fibroblasts. The ultrastructure of the cells and their organization closely resembles human granulation tissue. Cancer 42:2304?2310, 1978.

AB  - Analysis was made of 37 cases of Chondrosarcoma of the maxilla or the mandible. The most common complaint at initial presentation was the presence of a mass. Pain was a presenting symptom in less than half of the patients. The usual roentgenographic appearance was an ill-defined radiolucency with mottled areas of calcification. When teeth were involved, some cases showed a widened periodontal membrane space on periapical dental radiographs. Histologically, the tumors usually showed recognizable cartilage and a lobular growth pattern, but cellular evidence of malignancy was often subtle. Radical surgery was the treatment of choice. Prognosis appears best when such surgery is performed soon after the onset of symptoms. Also, patients presenting with mandibular tumors and with tumors of the better differentiated histologic grades enjoy a better survival time. Neck dissection is probably not warranted for Chondrosarcoma of the jaws. Contrary to the relationship between these two tumors in other skeletal sites, the overall prognosis for Chondrosarcoma of the jaws does not appear to be as good as that for osteosarcoma of the jaws.

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which are dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Abstract Research studies have revealed that people with hoarding typically collect and keep items due to their aesthetic appeal, utility and strong emotional attachment to the items resulting in clutter and limiting living spaces. This study aims to explore the experiences of individuals with hoarding disorder to understand and describe?the patterns and reasons for hoarding, experiences with decluttering and the impact of hoarding disorder on significant others and society in the context of a multi-ethnic urban Asian country. A total of 12 participants with hoarding disorder were recruited and interviewed using a simple semi-structured interview guide designed for the study. The resulting transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The mean age of the participants was 56.7 years (SD = 14.5). Nine super-ordinate and discrete but interconnecting themes emerged from the qualitative interviews: types of hoarded items, sources of hoarded items, ways of storing/arranging hoarded items, help-seeking/treatment contact, reasons for hoarding, experiences with decluttering, impact upon family, community and self, restricting hoarding behaviours and insight. Key themes identified in the study are consistent with the literature on studies on hoarding which have been done in other populations. Hoarding in the community has serious consequences for individuals with hoarding disorder and others living in the community, which is compounded by the lack of insight among these individuals. There is a pressing need to increase public awareness and recognition of hoarding behaviours to aid efforts in bringing timely and appropriate services to the affected individuals.

AB  - Summary In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating, and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the Committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Seventh Edition, like its predecessor, has consistently applied the category and grading system definitions in the fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was used since the fourth edition has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. The Seventh Edition discusses 87 fact sheets (14 new fact sheets since the Sixth Edition) for therapeutic apheresis diseases and medical conditions, with 179 indications, which are separately graded and categorized within the listed fact sheets. Several diseases that are Category IV which have been described in detail in previous editions and do not have significant new evidence since the last publication are summarized in a separate table. The Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue serves as a key resource that guides the utilization of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of human disease. J. Clin.

AB  - Multiple pathological processes are responsible for renal transplant loss. Development of effective prophylactic regimens requires that risks associated with different outcomes be assessed when several processes act together. A multistate competing risk model that derived multiple endpoint probabilities without averaging impacts of covariates over different outcomes or overestimating fractions of survivors was used to estimate the influence of 16 factors simultaneously on four failure types (acute rejection, chronic rejection, death with a functioning graft and all other causes combined). We analyzed 12?413 non-Black and 5121 Black patients undergoing primary cadaveric kidney transplantation reported to UNOS during 1994?96. Black recipients generally demonstrated higher rates of failure, but the method provided joint probabilities for each failure type and covariate level. To illustrate, a middle-aged Black recipient had probabilities of 6.5%, 5.9%, 2.6% and 6.6% to experience acute rejection failure, chronic rejection failure, death with a functioning graft and other failures, respectively, within 3?years. The corresponding non-Black's chances were 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.6%. The overall 3-year survival equaled 78.4% [100%-(6.5%?+?5.9%?+?2.6%?+?6.6%)] and 88.3% for Blacks and non-Blacks, respectively. The growing complexity of transplantation will benefit from new analytic approaches that accommodate multiple transitions along diverse paths to eventual graft loss or death.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have suggested that heroin addiction is associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities. However, it is largely unknown whether these characteristics of brain abnormalities would be persistent or restored after long periods of abstinence. Considering the very high rates of relapse, we hypothesized that there may exist some latent neural vulnerabilities in abstinent heroin users. In this study, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 30 former heroin-dependent (FHD) subjects who were drug free for more than 3 years and 30 non-addicted control (CN) volunteers. Voxel-based morphometry was used to identify possible gray matter volume differences between the FHD and CN groups. Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in FHD were examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. Significantly reduced gray matter volume was observed in FHD in an area surrounding the parieto-occipital sulcus, which included the precuneus and cuneus. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that the FHD subjects showed reduced positive correlation within the default mode network and visual network and decreased negative correlation between the default mode network, visual network and task positive network. Moreover, the altered functional connectivity was correlated with self-reported impulsivity scores in the FHD subjects. Our findings suggest that disruption of large-scale brain systems is present in former heroin users even after multi-year abstinence, which could serve as system-level neural underpinnings for behavioral dysfunctions associated with addiction.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

AB  - Abstract Background To explore the similar and different pathogenesis between non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Methods This study used bioinformatics methods, including functional enrichment analysis, compared the topological features of SCLC and NSCLC in the human protein interaction network in a system aspect, and analyzed the highly intense modules from an integrated network. Results This study included 5082 and 2781 significantly different expression genes for NSCLC and SCLC, respectively. The differently expressed genes of NSCLC are mainly distributed in the extracellular region and synapse. By contrast, the genes of SCLC are located in the organelle, macromolecular complex, membrane-enclosed lumen, cell part, envelope, and synapse. Compared with SCLC, the differently expressed genes of NSCLC act in the biological regulation, multicellular organismal process, and viral reproduction and locomotion, which show that NSCLC is more likely to cause a wide range of cancer cell proliferation and virus infection than SCLC. The network topological properties of SCLC and NSCLC are similar, except the average shortest path length, which indicates that most of the genes of the two lung cancers play a similar function in the entire body. The commonly expressed genes show that all of the genes in the module may also cause NSCLC and SCLC, simultaneously. Conclusions The proteins in module will involve the same or similar biological functions and the interactions among them induce the occurrence of lung cancer. Moreover, a potential biomarker of SCLC is the interaction between APIP and apoptotic protease activating factor (APAF)1, which share a common module.

AB  - Objective To characterize the configuration of incomplete proximal fractures of the proximal phalanx (P1) in horses not used for racing and compare radiographic with computed tomography (CT) findings. Study Design Historical cohort. Animals Twenty-four horses with incomplete fractures of P1. Methods Medical records of horses not used for racing diagnosed with an incomplete proximal fracture of P1 based on clinical and radiographic examination and confirmed by CT between 2008 and 2013 were retrieved. Radiographs and CT studies of these horses were analyzed using a subjective grading system and by measuring variables that characterized fracture configuration. Results Twenty-four horses were included (20 Warmbloods) with a mean age of 9.5 years and mean body weight of 574?kg. Fourteen forelimbs and 10 hind limbs were affected. Mean duration of lameness was 8.7 weeks. Computed tomography was superior to radiography in both identifying the fracture and determining fracture size and location. On CT, 92% of fractures were located in the mid-sagittal plane. Mean proximodistal length of the fracture was 13?mm. Fractures were frequently not bicortical. Fractures in forelimbs were located significantly more dorsally than fractures in hind limbs. A distinct fracture pattern with 2 subchondral lines running parallel in close proximity to each other was identified in 54% of cases. Conclusion Incomplete proximal fractures of P1 have significant variation in their configurations, especially their dorsopalmar/-plantar location. Computed tomography examination allowed clear identification of the fracture configurations and was superior to radiography.

AB  - ABSTRACT The 37/67-kDa laminin receptor (LAMR/RPSA) was originally identified as a 67-kDa binding protein for laminin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that provides cellular adhesion to the basement membrane. LAMR has evolutionary origins, however, as a 37-kDa RPS2 family ribosomal component. Expressed in all domains of life, RPS2 proteins have been shown to have remarkably diverse physiological roles that vary across species. Contributing to laminin binding, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, and nuclear functions, this protein governs critical cellular processes including growth, survival, migration, protein synthesis, development, and differentiation. Unsurprisingly given its purview, LAMR has been associated with metastatic cancer, neurodegenerative disease and developmental abnormalities. Functioning in a receptor capacity, this protein also confers susceptibility to bacterial and viral infection. LAMR is clearly a molecule of consequence in human disease, directly mediating pathological events that make it a prime target for therapeutic interventions. Despite decades of research, there are still a large number of open questions regarding the cellular biology of LAMR, the nature of its ability to bind laminin, the function of its intrinsically disordered C-terminal region and its conversion from 37 to 67 kDa. This review attempts to convey an in-depth description of the complexity surrounding this multifaceted protein across functional, structural and pathological aspects.
