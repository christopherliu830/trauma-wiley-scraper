AB  - ABSTRACT This paper will provide theoretical and clinical evidence for the significance of relating to and dissociating from the object in the development of a regulatory function. A selective review examines psychoanalytic views concerning the interactive nature of innate and environmental factors in development. The role of trauma is also considered as a contributing factor in individual differences. Relevant clinical material is described from two sessions in the treatment of a traumatized young woman with bulimia, focusing on the regulatory function in the therapeutic relationship. The patient frequently dissociated from the therapist as object and substituted the resulting loss of regulation with a pendulous movement between over-indulgence and deprivation. This created significant implications for treatment. The clinical findings suggest that the inclusion of these different aspects may be necessary factors in understanding the developmental pathway from intolerable frustration/impulsivity to an internal sense of containment.

AB  - Objectives To determine if proteinuria is more common in dogs with lymphoma when compared with healthy dogs and to assess the severity and frequency of proteinuria in dogs with lymphoma. Methods Determination of urine protein:creatinine ratio in 32 dogs with lymphoma compared with 30 healthy dogs. Results Canine patients with lymphoma are more likely to be proteinuric compared with healthy dogs. Proteinuria is common in dogs with lymphoma, although in most cases it is not severe. The presence of proteinuria is not linked with the stage or substage of lymphoma. Clinical Significance Mild proteinuria is a common finding in dogs with lymphoma. The clinical impact of the proteinuria is probably low.

AB  - Abstract Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with angiogenesis and early relapse of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the role of miR-148a in the regulation of VEGF/angiogenesis and early relapse of CRC. We established a stable clone with miR-148a expression in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines and created a hypoxic condition by using CoCl2 to determine the underlying mechanism of miR-148a. The effects of miR-148a on the phosphoryl-ERK (pERK)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/VEGF pathway were evaluated through Western blotting and the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on angiogenesis was demonstrated through a tube formation assay. Sixty-three CRC tissues (28 early relapse and 35 non-early relapse) were analysed to assess the relationship between miR-148a and HIF-1α/VEGF. The protein expression of pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF in HCT116 and HT29 cells was significantly decreased by miR-148a (all P < 0.05). The protein expression of VEGF/HIF-1α was strongly inversely associated with the expression of miR-148a in the 63 CRC tissue samples (all P < 0.05). Tube formation assay demonstrated that miR-148a significantly obliterated angiogenesis. miR-148a suppresses VEGF through down-regulation of the pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and might lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis; miR-148a down-regulation increased the early relapse rate of CRC. This demonstrates that miR-148a is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

AB  - Summary Equine chronic progressive lymphoedema (CPL) is a disabling disorder of draught horse breeds. Combined decongestive therapy (CDT) is the treatment of choice for lymphoedema in man and has been adapted for use in horses. Equine CDT, which includes manual lymph drainage (MLD) and subsequent bandaging with short stretch bandages, was expected to improve the signs of CPL in draught horses because CPL resembles primary lymphoedema in man. Five affected horses - Gypsy cob (n?=?1), Clydesdale (n?=?1), Shires (n?=?3) - were included. Lesions were documented pre- and post treatment. Percentage volume loss of the distal legs was calculated using the disc model. Initial plans for daily CDT had to be adapted; intermittent treatment of Chorioptes infections required alternating between CDT and MLD in 4/5 horses. Concurrent pyoderma (1/5 horses) was treated throughout the study. Development of unrelated lameness (hoof abscess) allowed limited CDT treatment only in one horse. Marked softening of previously firm tissue indicated the change from ?brawny? to pitting oedema in 2/5 horses. Fibrotic nodules and folds in the pasterns became markedly softened and smaller in 2/5 horses. Skin surface notably improved in all horses: hyperkeratosis decreased, erosions and ulcerations healed completely and crusts disappeared. After 2 weeks, a mean volume reduction of 11.25% was seen, ranging from 4.75?21.74% and quality of movement improved. This pilot study documents evidence that CDT assists management of CPL. Current CPL management is limited to palliative treatments of secondary infections. Whilst not a permanent treatment, CDT offers a promising tool to manage horses with CPL, improving their quality of life and potential usefulness. More extensive and prolonged studies with a larger number of horses are warranted to evaluate the full potential of CDT.

AB  - Abstract A skeleton from a 16?18th century burial site in Krosno Odrza?skie, Poland, was examined using classical morphological, metric and macroscopic palaeopathological observations, as well as radiography and tomography of the skull and long bones. A wide variety of the observed bone deformations probably occurred as a consequence of past rickets and/or osteomalacia, whose primary cause may also have been chronic renal failure. Preservation of the bones enables a discussion of the cause of such pathological changes. The subject under study appears to be a very interesting example of an individual whose skeleton shows advanced pathological alterations associated with the subject's vitamin D deficiency, overall health conditions and relatively long lifespan.

AB  - Abstract Tendon injuries are common musculoskeletal system disorders in clinical, but the regeneration ability of tendon is limited. Tendon stem cells (TSCs) have shown promising effect on tissue engineering and been used for the treatment of tendon injury. Exosomes that serve as genetic information carriers have been implicated in many diseases and physiological processes, but effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury repair is unclear. The aim of this study is to make clear that the effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury healing. Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5 weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3. Exosomes from TSCs could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing for its balancing tendon extracellular matrix and promoting the tenogenesis of TSCs.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify utilisation of imaging for patients presenting to an ED with back pain, their characteristics and dispositions. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 1132 ED presentations for back pain to an Australian metropolitan ED in 2013 was performed. Patient demographics, rates of radiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and rates of subsequent admission and ED re-presentation were analysed. Results Patients aged 26?35?years were the largest group presenting with back pain (19.4% of presentations), with the majority being female (52.3%). Imaging was requested at 29.5% (n?=?334) of presentations (radiography n?=?297; advanced imaging n?=?63). Patients over 70?years had higher imaging rates than younger patients (49.4% vs 25.5%, P?<?0.001). Imaging was not associated with attendance during or outside office hours (29.3% vs 31.8%, P?=?0.4). Of presentations, 34.1% resulted in admission, with no association between imaging and admission (31.8% vs 36.0%, P?=?0.2) or ED re-presentation for back pain in the same year (6.5% vs 9.7%, P?=?0.09). Conclusion This study provides benchmark data on the use of imaging for back pain in an Australian ED, an area which has been largely unexplored. The rate of imaging in the ED was higher than previously reported in a General Practice setting. Consistent with guidelines, patients older than 70 were more than twice as likely to receive imaging compared to younger patients. It was beyond the scope of the current study to determine whether these images were clinically indicated and further research is required to determine if initiatives to reduce imaging in this population are warranted.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Urethral strictures, bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and urorectal fistulation are three well-recognised complications of the treatment of prostate cancer, whether by surgery or non-surgical treatment. Because these are relatively rare problems the treatment is uncertain. There is a heavy reliance on endoscopic or instrumental management of urethral strictures and of bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and there is little discrimination in any of these conditions between those that are the result of surgery and those that are the result of radiotherapy and other treatment methods using external energy sources. This review aims to clarify out current understanding of these three clinical problems and draws attention to the role of reconstructive surgery, particularly when dealing with bladder neck contractures, prostatic urethral stenoses and urorectal fistula. This also shows that the nature of the problem, the recovery time after treatment and the degree of functional recovery is radically different in the surgical as against the non-surgical group, to a degree that the authors believe is not sufficiently stressed when patients are counselled and consented before their primary treatment. ?? To review the less common and not widely discussed, but much more serious complications of prostate cancer treatment of: urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture and urorectal fistula. ?? The treatment options for patients with organ-confirmed prostate cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy; with each method or combination of methods having associated complications. ?? Complications resulting from RP are relatively easy to manage, with rapid recovery and return to normal activities, and usually a return to normal bodily functions. ?? However, after non-surgical treatments, i.e. BT, EBRT, HIFU and cryotherapy, these same problems are more difficult to treat with a much slower return to a much lower level of function. ?? When counselling patients about the primary treatment of prostate cancer they should be advised that although the same type of complication may occur after surgical or non-surgical treatment, the scope and scale of that complication, the ease with which it is treated and the degree of restoration of normality after treatment, is altogether in favour of surgery in those for whom surgery is appropriate and who are fit for surgery.

AB  - The present study investigates the feasibility of micro perfusion of femoral head specimens from femoral neck fracture patients by the inferior retinacular arteries and performing intraosseous artery quantitative analysis of the femoral head. Twelve femoral neck fracture patients who had undergone conventional hip replacement surgery were included in this study. Femoral head specimen arteries were first dissected and exposed and then perfused by the inferior retinacular arteries and all the femoral heads underwent micro-CT scanning. After micro-CT scanning, a digital 3-D model was reconstructed to quantify the femoral head intraosseous arteries for comparison with a normal femoral head. The artery length density, artery volume density, and artery length/volume ratio were calculated separately and compared with normal femoral head parameters. Micro-CT scanning displayed the epiphyseal arterial network structure and their fine vascular branches in all 12 femoral neck fractures. Blood was supplied from the inferior retinacular artery to the epiphyseal arterial network then to all the fine blood vessels within the femoral head. No statistical differences were observed in femoral heads? intraosseous artery length densities or volume densities between the normal and femoral neck fracture specimens, while the artery length/volume ratio showed a statistical difference, and the ratio increased from 19 to 46. Micro perfusion of the femoral head by the inferior retinacular arteries is possible and can present the epiphyseal network and their fine arterial branches in pathologic conditions to provide a morphological basis for the study of femoral head disease.

AB  - Abstract Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare condition that can be locally aggressive. The mainstay of treatment remains wide local excision, with varied adjuvant therapy as needed. The authors describe their experience in the treatment of a series of patients and propose the classification of primary and secondary breast fibromatosis. A single-institution retrospective analysis of patients treated for breast fibromatosis from 2003 to 2017 was completed. Demographic data, pertinent past medical history, and treatment modalities were reviewed. Primary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the absence of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. Secondary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the setting of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. A total of 16 patients were included with the median age 40 (28-64) years. The average size of the lesion was 6.37 cm (range of 1.5-15 cm). Mean follow-up time was 65 months. Surgical excision was completed in 14 patients, with two recurrences. There were no recurrences in patients with surgical margins >1 cm. Two patients were treated nonsurgically. There were seven patients with primary fibromatosis of the breast and nine patients with secondary fibromatosis of the breast. Fibromatosis of the breast is difficult to diagnose prior to surgical excision. We advocate for the multi-disciplinary treatment of this disease process with an aggressive surgical approach to achieve margins >1 cm.

AB  - Abstract Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Background The Safe Passage Study is a large, prospective, multidisciplinary study designed to (1) investigate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and stillbirth, and (2) determine the biological basis of the spectrum of phenotypic outcomes from exposure, as modified by environmental and genetic factors that increase the risk of stillbirth, SIDS, and in surviving children, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Methods The results provided are based on an interim assessment of 6004 women enrolled, out of the 12?000 projected, from the Northern Plains, US, and Cape Town, South Africa, areas known to be of high risk for maternal drinking during pregnancy. Research objectives, study design, and descriptive statistics, including consent, recruitment, and retention information, are provided. Results Overall visit compliance is 87%, and includes prenatal, delivery/newborn, and postnatal contacts through 1 year post-delivery. Pregnancy outcome ascertainment is 98% prior to medical chart review; less than 2% of women withdraw. Consent for the use of DNA and placental tissue exceed 94%, and consent to participate in the autopsy portion of the study is 71%. Conclusions The Safe Passage Study is the first multi-site study of SIDS and stillbirth to integrate prospectively collected exposure information with multidisciplinary biological information in the same maternal and fetal/infant dyad using a common protocol. Essential components of the study design and its success are close ties to the community and rigorous systems and processes to ensure compliance with the study protocol and procedures.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype.

AB  - Abstract Background. Proliferative myositis is a rare, benign, reactive intramuscular lesion of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin; an identical lesion in a subcutaneous or fascial location is referred to as proliferative fasciitis. The rapid growth rate and unusual histopathologic features have frequently been mistaken for a malignant process and have promoted unnecessary invasive procedures. Here we present only the third oral case of proliferative myositis, arising from the tongue of a 65-year-old man. Methods and Results. Histologically, the resected lesion was composed of numerous fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cells and variable numbers of large ganglion-like cells infiltrating between and around muscle fascicles, resembling a ?checkerboard? configuration. A demographic profile of proliferative myositis of the head and neck is also provided, compiled from 19 patients culled from an English-language literature review and this report. Conclusions. Incisional biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy of proliferative myositis of the head and neck should lead to spontaneous resolution and is, therefore, sufficient to render the diagnosis and to provide conservative treatment. Recurrence is extremely rare. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2007

AB  - A standardized trauma was inflicted to the lateral side of the calf muscle of 12 New Zealand rabbits, creating a muscle hematoma without external bleeding. The acute hematoma was evaluated within 3 h with radionuclide imaging of red blood cells labelled with 99mTc pertechnetate, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results were compared with the total volume of the hematomas as calculated from histological preparations of each injured muscle. Scintigraphy and T2-weighted MRI accurately detected all hematomas but the calculated volume did not significantly correlate with histology. T1-weighted MRI did not detect the hematomas. Ultrasonography detected all hematomas and also accurately evaluated the volume. In conclusion, scintigraphy, MR imaging and ultrasonography are all sensitive enough to detect an acute muscle injury, but in this investigation only ultrasonography accurately quantified the volume of the hematoma.

AB  - A ureteral sarcoma was diagnosed in a nine-year-old Weimaraner dog with gross haematuria, severe unilateral hydronephrosis, and hydroureter. Treatment consisted of unilateral nephrectomy and ureterectomy. This case was compared with 14 other ureteral tumours reported in the veterinary literature. Only three previous reports concerned a malignant ureteral tumour. Urinary tract neoplasms mainly involve the bladder and the kidney, and more rarely the urethra. The purpose of this paper is to report a rare case of malignant ureteral tumour in a dog.

AB  - Objective To determine the response of Australian cats with lymphosarcoma to chemotherapy and/or surgery in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, haematological and serum biochemical values and retroviral status. Design Prospective study of 61 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma subjected to multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. Procedure An accepted chemotherapy protocol utilising l-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate and prednisolone was modified and used to treat 60 cats with lymphosarcoma. Clinical findings were recorded before and during therapy. As far as practical, cases were followed to death, euthanasia or apparent cure. Owner satisfaction with the results of chemotherapy was determined using a questionnaire sent after the completion of chemotherapy. Results One cat, with lymphosarcoma limited to a single mandibular lymph node, was treated using surgery alone and was cured. The other 60 cats were treated using multi-agent chemotherapy, although seven cats with localised intestinal, ocular and subcutaneous lesions had these lesions partially (2 intestinal lesions) or completely (2 eyes, 2 intestinal lesions and a cluster of regional lymph nodes) resected prior to starting chemotherapy. The median survival time for these 60 cats was 116 days. Of the 60 cats, 48 rapidly went into complete remission following the administration of l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone (complete remission rate 80%) and these cats had a median survival of 187 days. Three cats were censored from further analysis as their long-term survival data were uninterpretable because they died of causes unrelated to lymphosarcoma or were prematurely lost to follow-up. Twenty cats were classed as ?long-term survivors? based on survival time in excess of one year and at least 14 were ?cured? based on the absence of physical evidence of lymphosarcoma 2-years after initiating treatment. In other words, of the 48 cats that reached complete remission, in excess of 29% were ?cured?. Despite detailed analysis, few meaningful prognostic indicators based on patient or tumour characteristics were identified, although long-term survivors were more likely to be less than 4-years (P = 0.04) and to have tumours of the T-cell phenotype (P = 0.06). Excluding the one FeLV ELISA-positive cat with mediastinal LSA, 7 of 9 cats less than 4 years-of-age were long-term survivors (median survival time >1271 days). There was a strong association between achieving complete remission and long-term survival (P = 0.003). On the basis of 27 replies to a questionnaire, owners were generally very satisfied with the response to chemotherapy, irrespective of the survival time of the individual patient. Eighty five percent of owners expressed complete satisfaction with their decision to pursue chemotherapy and 70% believed their cat's health status improved during the first 2-weeks of treatment. Importantly, 78% of owners considered that chemotherapy required a very substantial time commitment on their part. Conclusions It was possible to cure approximately one quarter of cats with lymphosarcoma using sequential multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. FeLV-negative cats younger than 4 years (typically with mediastinal lymphosarcoma) had a particularly favourable prognosis. The decision to embark on chemotherapy should be based on the results of induction chemotherapy with l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone, as the response to this was a good predictor of long-term survival. Cats surviving the first 16 weeks of chemotherapy generally enjoyed robust remissions (in excess of 1 year) or were cured of their malignancy.

AB  - Minimally invasive techniques aimed at minimizing surgery-associated risk and morbidity of spinal surgery have increased in popularity in recent years. Their potential advantages include reduced length of hospital stay, blood loss, and requirement for post-operative analgesia and earlier return to work. One such minimally invasive technique is the use of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation, which is paramount for promoting rigid and stable constructs and fusion in the context of trauma, tumors, deformity and degenerative disease. Percutaneous pedicle screw insertion can be an intimidating prospect for surgeons who have only been trained in open techniques. One of the ongoing challenges of this percutaneous system is to provide the surgeon with adequate access to the pedicle entry anatomy and adequate tactile or visual feedback concerning the position and anatomy of the rod and set-screw construct. This review article discusses the history and evolution of percutaneous pedicle screw retractor technologies and outlines the advances over the last decade in the rapidly expanding field of minimal access surgery for posterior pedicle screw based spinal stabilization. As indications for percutaneous pedicle screw techniques expand, the nuances of the minimally invasive surgery techniques and associated technologies will also multiply. It is important that experienced surgeons have access to tools that can improve access with a greater degree of ease, simplicity and safety. We here discuss the technical challenges of percutaneous pedicle screw retractor technologies and a variety of systems with a focus on the pros and cons of various retractor systems.

AB  - In major orthopaedic surgery, it is recommended to detect and correct preoperative anaemia several weeks prior to surgery. However, in many cases, the procedure is urgent or the patient is evaluated shortly before the intervention. As iron deficiency is the leading cause of perioperative anaemia, an exhaustive review of the literature was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of short-term perioperative intravenous, with or without erythropoietin, or postoperative oral or intravenous supplementation in major orthopaedic surgery. Overall, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 13 randomized trials (moderate quality) and seven observational studies (low to very low quality). The primary outcomes were reduction in transfusion requirements, haemoglobin increase and medication side-effects during the study period. Data analysis showed that postoperative oral iron administration neither increased haemoglobin nor reduced transfusion requirements, and it was associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects (15%). In contrast, for some patient populations, perioperative or postoperative administration of intravenous iron, with or without recombinant erythropoietin, may reduce transfusion requirements and/or hasten the recovery from postoperative, with few clinically relevant adverse effects (<2%). However, discrepancies between randomized trials and observational studies on the possible beneficial effects of short-term perioperative intravenous iron administration were found for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture repair. Further studies are needed to elucidate when the treatment should be started, which combination of drugs should be used, and which patient groups would be most benefit.
