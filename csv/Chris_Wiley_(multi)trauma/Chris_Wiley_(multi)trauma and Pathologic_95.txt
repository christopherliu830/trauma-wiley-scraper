AB  - Summary Massive obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality world-wide. Using the Australian and New Zealand Massive Transfusion Registry, we performed a bi-national cohort study of MOH defined as bleeding at ≥20 weeks? gestation or postpartum requiring ≥5 red blood cells (RBC) units within 4 h. Between 2008 and 2015, we identified 249 cases of MOH cases from 19 sites. Predominant causes of MOH were uterine atony (22%), placenta praevia (20%) and obstetric trauma (19%). Intensive care unit admission and/or hysterectomy occurred in 44% and 29% of cases, respectively. There were three deaths. Hypofibrinogenaemia (<2 g/l) occurred in 52% of cases in the first 24 h after massive transfusion commenced; of these cases, 74% received cryoprecipitate. Median values of other haemostatic tests were within accepted limits. Plasma, platelets or cryoprecipitate were transfused in 88%, 66% and 57% of cases, respectively. By multivariate regression, transfusion of ≥6 RBC units before the first cryoprecipitate (odds ratio [OR] 3·5, 95% CI: 1·7?7·2), placenta praevia (OR 7·2, 95% CI: 2·0?26·4) and emergency caesarean section (OR 4·9, 95% CI: 2·0?11·7) were independently associated with increased risk of hysterectomy. These findings confirm MOH as a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and indicate areas for practice improvement.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the efficacy hydroxyapatite cement as an alternative to autologous fat in the obliteration of the frontal sinus after trauma or chronic suppuration. Methods Single institution, nonrandomized, prospective analysis of patients treated in an academic, tertiary care center. Patients were followed with physical examinations and were monitored for recurrent infections, which would have necessitated removal of the implant. Follow-up radiographs were obtained at 12 months. Standard surgical techniques were used to obliterate the frontal sinus with the addition of the placement of a vascularized pericardial flap along the frontal sinus floor. Results Eleven patients underwent hydroxyapatite frontal sinus obliteration. There were 2 women and 9 men in the series with age ranges from 33 to 82 years (mean, 48 y). Three patients underwent obliteration for trauma and 8 for chronic infections with or without mucopyocele. The mean follow-up is 27 months (range, 3.3?37 mo). No patient has developed clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrent frontal sinusitis and at this point no implants have been removed. Nine of 11 patients (91%) report complete resolution of all symptoms. Conclusion Hydroxyapatite cement had demonstrated efficacy in full-thickness reconstruction of frontal sinus defects. The pericranial flap may provide a barrier to prevent infection of the implant in the face of acute ethmoid sinusitis. Hydroxyapatite cement offers the advantages of no donor site morbidity and the potential for complete osseointegration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A precocious detection of cardiac autonomic dysfunction is of major clinical interest that could lead to a more intensive supervision of diabetic patients. However, classical clinical exploration of cardiac autonomic function is not easy to undertake in a reproducible way. Thus, respective interests of autonomic nervous parameters provided by both clinical tests and computerized analysis of resting blood pressure were checked in type 1 diabetic patients without orthostatic hypotension and microalbuminuria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen diabetic subjects matched for age and gender to thirteen healthy subjects volunteered to participate to the study. From clinical tests (standing up, deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, handgrip test), autonomic function was scored according to Ewing's methodology. Analysis of resting beat to beat blood pressure provided autonomic indices of the cardiac function (spectral analysis or Z analysis). RESULTS: 5 of the 13 diabetic patients exhibited a pathological score (more than one pathological response) suggesting the presence of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The most discriminative test was the deep breathing test. However, spectral indices of BP recordings and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) of these 5 subjects were similar to those of healthy subjects and of remaining diabetic subjects. CONCLUSION: Alteration in Ewing's score given by clinical tests may not reflect an alteration of cardiac autonomic function in asymptomatic type I diabetic patients, because spectral indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic (including BRS) function were within normal range. Our results strongly suggest to confront results provided by both methodologies before concluding to an autonomic cardiac impairment in asymptomatic diabetic patients.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - Abstract Tissue diagnosis of a soft tissue neoplasm is of paramount importance for the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Biopsy technique including approach and biopsy method is important to the success of diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Histologic and cytologic diagnoses are difficult and complicated by the large number of soft tissue lesions described, distinctly different biopotential for morphologically similar lesions, often small biopsy specimen size, and the generally limited experience many pathologists have in the diagnosis of soft tissue neoplasms. While utilized less frequently than core-needle biopsies, fine-needle aspiration is a valuable initial approach for the classification of soft tissue neoplasms. The combination of pattern based morphologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics represents a utilitarian and generally successful approach for the diagnosis of soft tissue lesions.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adipose tissue deposited along the crest of the neck has been associated with altered metabolic states and with an increased risk of laminitis in equids. Thickness of the neck is a phenotipic characteristic in Andalusians; however, there are no studies evaluating this condition in this breed. Objectives To evaluate morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements in the neck area for assessment of neck adiposity and its associations with adiposity scores and biochemical variables. Study design A sample of 115 Andalusian horses (46 barren mares and 69 stallions, 2?15 years old) was evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Methods Cresty neck score (CNS) was determined. Two groups were created: cresty neck (CNS?≥?3) and noncresty neck (CNS<3) horses. Neck circumference (NC) (cm) and ultrasonography (US) of subcutaneous fat (mm) at 25% (NC0.25?US0.25), 50% (NC0.50?US0.50) and 75% (NC0.75?US0.75) of neck length were measured. Middle neck circumference (NC), neck length and height at the withers were taken to calculate neck ratios (NC0.50:height, NC0.50:neck length). Plasma was analysed for insulin and leptin. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as insulin ≥20??iu/ml. Correlations using Pearson and Spearman coefficients were evaluated. Mean comparisons were carried out with Student's t or Mann-Whitney tests. Results Cresty neck condition was present in 73.9% (n?=?85) of the horses and 2.6% (n?=?3) were hyperinsulinaemic. Cresty neck horses had significantly higher plasma leptin, morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements. NC0.50:height was the most correlated parameter with CNS. Insulin was correlated with leptin levels and all morphometric measurements. Insulin and leptin were correlated only with US0.75. Conclusions Andalusian horses? neck score, despite their thick necks in the majority of individuals, does not have a good correlation with plasma insulin and leptin levels. Since in Andalusian horses, neck scores may be overestimating obesity, further studies on ultrasonographic fat measurements are needed. Ethical animal research:?The university committee for the ethical use of animals approved all procedures. Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract A growing awareness of the problems caused by osteoporosis-related fractures has led to increased investigation of the condition in past populations. The present study seeks to examine the ways in which osteoporosis-related fractures may be explored through different approaches; modern clinical information, historical records of fractures and analysis of archaeological bone may provide fuller information on the condition. The three types of fractures upon which this study focuses are fractures of the femoral neck, Colles' fractures and vertebral compression fractures. The results of the investigation clearly demonstrate the way in which the various sources produce a slightly different picture of the condition. The archaeological significance of the different types of fractures was found to be the reverse of that which would be suspected in the light of information derived from historical sources and the clinical literature. To date vertebral crush fractures have been the most commonly found osteoporosis-related fracture in archaeological material, but their significance to people in the past is likely to have been minimal. In contrast hip fractures have rarely been reported from archaeological bone material, but historical information makes it clear they were well known, and knowledge derived from clinical sources emphasizes the serious consequences of such a fracture for the affected individuals. The results indicate the value of undertaking a multi-disciplinary approach where possible. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common monogenic disorder causing hypophosphatemia. This case-note review documents the clinical features and the complications of treatment in 59 adults (19 male, 40 female) with XLH. XLH is associated with a large number of private mutations; 37 different mutations in the PHEX gene were identified in this cohort, 14 of which have not been previously reported. Orthopaedic involvement requiring surgical intervention (osteotomy) was frequent. Joint replacement and decompressive laminectomy were observed in those older than 40 years. Dental disease (63%), nephrocalcinosis (42%), and hearing impairment (14%) were also common. The rarity of the disease and the large number of variants make it difficult to discern specific genotype-phenotype relationships. A new treatment, an anti-FGF23 antibody, that may affect the natural history of the disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

AB  - Summary A 25 year-old American Paint gelding was referred to the Onderstepoort Academic Veterinary Hospital with an ulcerated lesion of nonpigmented skin at the right lateral aspect of the perianal region. An infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma was suspected. Surgical excision and ablation with sharp surgical excision and a diode laser was performed although complete excision was not possible due to the tumour location. Intralesional chemotherapy was performed at the completion of the surgical excision and continued in the post-operative period. Histological examination of the excised lesion confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and revealed incomplete resection margins at the medial, dorsal and ventral aspects of the surgical site. The surgical site healed uneventfully and a re-examination at 6 months post-surgery revealed the gelding to have normal clinical parameters with no perianal lesions.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare age, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, outcome, treatment and clinical response between cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease with normal or increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations. Methods: Medical records for 23 cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations available were reviewed. Three groups were compared; cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations 2·0 to 6·8 µg/l (group A), 6·9 to 11·9 µg/l (group B) and ≥12·0 µg/l (group C). Results: Sixteen of the 23 cats had increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations; 9 cats in group B and 7 cats in group C. The remaining seven cats were in group A. Cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l had significantly lower median serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations. No significant differences were identified between the three groups for age, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, clinical outcome, treatment or clinical response. Clinical Significance: Hypoalbuminaemia and hypocobalaminaemia were more frequently observed in cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations ≥12·0 µg/l.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To display time-series firing rate and recruitment data for multiple, simultaneously active motoneurons activating human laryngeal muscles. These data provide specific information about how laryngeal muscle force is being controlled by the central nervous system at the level of the lower motoneuron. Methods A quadrifilar needle electrode was used to record multi-channel myoelectric signals from thyroarytenoid muscle of normal subjects during tasks ranging from quiet breathing to a short sentence. Motor unit action potentials of the signal space were identified and tracked throughout task productions using pattern recognition and Precision Decomposition software. Results We present the first recordings and analyses of multiple motor unit activations in the larynx. The firing times and mean firing rates are plotted for each identified motor unit, which reveal recruitment and decruitment information and the database from which common firing statistics across motor units may be derived. Conclusions This study provides new information about neuromuscular physiology of the larynx. Specifically, the results reveal the ordered recruitment and firing patterns of multiple motor units and the existence of common drive from the central nervous system. The technique may prove fundamental to understanding various neuromuscular pathologies such as laryngeal spasm and to assist clinical prognosis of laryngeal paresis and the diagnosis of certain neurogenic disorders.

AB  - Giant-cell reparative granuloma occurring in the thoracic vertebra of a 16-year-old girl is presented, and the literature concerining the subject is reviewed. This report is of the second documented case with this essentially rare lesion arising in the vertebra. Microscopically, the lesion was characterized by a reactive granulation tissue with formation of reactive osteoid, collagenization and vascularization, and focal accumulations of giant cells, particularly around hemorrhagic portions. The patient is doing well without further recurrence 38 months after the second therapeutic curettage. The authors describe the clinicopathologic features of this particular case because of its rarity in location, and briefly discuss the difference from other giant-cell lesions of bone mainly in view of differential diagnosis.

AB  - The pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the progressive death of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to a clinical pictures mainly characterized by weakness, muscle wasting, brisk reflexes and Babinski sign. Routine electromyographic and electroneurographic studies are mandatory to a correct diagnosis but are unable to precisely quantify the pathological changes in the motor unit. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is a recent neurophysiological technique that allows to estimate number and amplitude of motor units in single muscles in order to assess the severity of ALS and to follow-up the progression of the disease. We applied this technique in 15 patients (12 male and 3 female; mean age?±?SD: 65.7?±?9.5?yrs, range 45?82), affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria, and in 11 healthy subjects (4 male and 7 female; mean age?±?SD: 63.7?±?8.2?yrs, range 50?76), in order to assess changes in motor unit features of abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in the mean number of motor units between the two groups: 75 in ADM and 51,8 in TA in the ALS cohort vs. 283,5 in ADM and 96,9 in the healthy subjects. Conversely, the differences in the mean and maximal area between the two groups did not reach the statistical significance (ALS patients: max area 34.7?mVms, mean area 1.9?mVms; healthy subjects: max area 18.2?mVms, mean area 0.9?mVms). Our preliminary results confirm that MUNE is able to quantify the pathological changes in motor unit parameter and represents an adequate follow-up tool for disease progression and effectiveness of pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Permanent facial nerve injury is a difficult challenge for both patients and physicians given its potential for debilitating functional, cosmetic, and psychological sequelae. Although current surgical interventions have provided considerable advancements in facial nerve rehabilitation, they often fail to fully address all impairments. We aim to introduce an alternative approach to facial nerve rehabilitation. Study Design Acute experiments in animals with normal facial function. Methods The study included three anesthetized cats. Four facial muscles (levator auris longus, orbicularis oculi, nasalis, and orbicularis oris) were monitored with a standard electromyographic (EMG) facial nerve monitoring system with needle electrodes. The main trunk of the facial nerve was exposed, and a 16-channel penetrating electrode array was placed into the nerve. Electrical current pulses were delivered to each stimulating electrode individually. Elicited EMG voltage outputs were recorded for each muscle. Results Stimulation through individual channels selectively activated restricted nerve populations, resulting in selective contraction of individual muscles. Increasing stimulation current levels resulted in increasing EMG voltage responses. Typically, selective activation of two or more distinct muscles was successfully achieved via a single placement of the multi-channel electrode array by selection of appropriate stimulation channels. Conclusion We have established in the animal model the ability of a penetrating electrode array to selectively stimulate restricted fiber populations within the facial nerve and to selectively elicit contractions in specific muscles and regions of the face. These results show promise for the development of a facial nerve implant system. Level of Evidence N/A.Laryngoscope, 2016 127:460?465, 2017

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.
