AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Permanent facial nerve injury is a difficult challenge for both patients and physicians given its potential for debilitating functional, cosmetic, and psychological sequelae. Although current surgical interventions have provided considerable advancements in facial nerve rehabilitation, they often fail to fully address all impairments. We aim to introduce an alternative approach to facial nerve rehabilitation. Study Design Acute experiments in animals with normal facial function. Methods The study included three anesthetized cats. Four facial muscles (levator auris longus, orbicularis oculi, nasalis, and orbicularis oris) were monitored with a standard electromyographic (EMG) facial nerve monitoring system with needle electrodes. The main trunk of the facial nerve was exposed, and a 16-channel penetrating electrode array was placed into the nerve. Electrical current pulses were delivered to each stimulating electrode individually. Elicited EMG voltage outputs were recorded for each muscle. Results Stimulation through individual channels selectively activated restricted nerve populations, resulting in selective contraction of individual muscles. Increasing stimulation current levels resulted in increasing EMG voltage responses. Typically, selective activation of two or more distinct muscles was successfully achieved via a single placement of the multi-channel electrode array by selection of appropriate stimulation channels. Conclusion We have established in the animal model the ability of a penetrating electrode array to selectively stimulate restricted fiber populations within the facial nerve and to selectively elicit contractions in specific muscles and regions of the face. These results show promise for the development of a facial nerve implant system. Level of Evidence N/A.Laryngoscope, 2016 127:460?465, 2017

AB  - Abstract The case history of a patient with primary liposarcoma of the humerus associated with a schwannoma of the radial nerve in the arm is described. Ultrastructurally, the neoplasm showed multiple and varied lipid droplets, dilated RER, mitochondria with electron-dense matrix, and microfilaments as the most prominent features. It is concluded, based on these ultrastructural observations, that liposarcoma of the bone is similar to pleomorphic liposarcoma arising in the soft tissues. This is the first ultrastructural study of a primary liposarcoma of the bone and the first reported association of this tumor with a schwannoma. The possible pathogenetic relationship between both tumors remains unknown.

AB  - Abstract Accumulated evidences indicate intestinal lesions play an important role in the pathogenesis of heatstroke. However, the underlying mechanisms by which heat stress causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in heat stress-induced intestinal hyper-permeability and bacterial translocation. Intestinal permeability in heat stressed mouse was evaluated by determining plasma endotoxin concentration and urinal lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio with gastric administration of L/M solution. Venous blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tissues were collected for bacterial load test. Real time PCR was used to determine ileum PAR1 mRNA expression. In vitro study, permeability was assessed by determining trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human intestinal Caco-2 cell line. RWJ-58259, a selective antagonist of PAR1, was used both in vivo and in vitro studies. The results showed that heat stress could increase ileum PAR1 mRNA level, urinal L/M ratio, plasma endotoxin concentration and bacterial load in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Blocking PAR1 with RWJ-58259 (10?mg/kg) pretreatment could significantly reduce heat stress-induced above changes, but have no role to PAR1 mRNA level. In Caco-2 cells, heat stress-induced high permeability could also be reduced by RWJ-58259 (5?20?µmol/L). In summary, our results demonstrated that PAR1 signaling pathway may play an important role in the heat stress-induced elevation of intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation and the occurrence of endotoxemia.

AB  - Summary Supragingival and subgingival plaque appear to be the multifactorial initiating sources of oropharyngeal inflammation in cats. Inflammation may occur secondary to internal triggers and stimulation from antigens and pathogens located within or below the gingiva and oral mucosa. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of periodontal disease where the inflammation is confined to the gingival soft tissues and does not clinically extend into the tooth's support. Periodontal diseases are the most common oral maladies diagnosed in dogs and cats. Furcation involvement or exposure occurs secondary to periodontitis. Oronasal fistula are established communications between the oral and nasal cavities secondary to advanced periodontal disease extending from the palatal surfaces of the maxillary canine in dogs and from traumatic extraction of the maxillary canine teeth. Professional oral care includes mechanical procedures performed in the oral cavity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate response and outcome of dogs with multicentric lymphoma treated with single-agent vinblastine as a second rescue. METHODS Medical records from 39 client-owned dogs receiving vinblastine rescue treatment (having relapsed on or following completion of UW-Madison and CCNU/L-asparaginase protocols), between 2005 and 2014, were reviewed for information regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, drug dosage, number of treatments, side effects, response and outcome. RESULTS The median starting dose of vinblastine was 2·6 mg/m2 (1·7 to 2·8 mg/m2), administered weekly until disease progression. Of the 39 dogs treated, 3 dogs (7·7%) achieved a complete remission, 7 dogs (17·9%) achieved a partial response, 18 dogs (46·2%) maintained stable disease and 11 (28·2%) had progressive disease. Ten dogs (25·6%) developed a grade III or IV neutropenia, and 4 dogs (10·3%) developed grade III or IV thrombocytopenia (one dog in both categories). After starting vinblastine, the median progression-free survival was 29·5 days (0 to 77 days) and overall median survival time was 46 days (4 to 250 days). Duration of first remission was identified as a positive predictor of outcome. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Single-agent vinblastine is well tolerated in dogs with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Responses were incomplete and short-lasting.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Objective Suicide risk in subjects at Ultra-High Risk of psychosis (UHR) has been rarely assessed in adolescence, but it is of obvious importance for prognostic and clinical care reasons. In this study, we aimed to prospectively assess suicide risk and behaviors in UHR adolescents. Method We examined 112 help-seeking adolescents (13?18 years, 50% males, 83.9% Caucasian) that were enrolled in the Reggio Emilia At-Risk Mental States (ReARMS) project and followed up for 2 years. Specific items derived from the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were used to assess suicide risk. Suicide attempts and completed suicides were also recorded. Results Baseline assessment detected 40 UHR adolescents, 32 FEP (first-episode psychosis), and 40 non-UHR/FEP. We found that 67.5% of UHR adolescents had suicidal ideation, and 18.5% to severe degree. Attempted suicide before enrollment was higher in the UHR group than in non-UHR/FEP peers (17.5% vs. 2.5%). BDI-II suicidal ideation severity was stable at 12-month follow-up and decreased at 24-month follow-up. Conclusions A high prevalence of suicidal ideation among UHR adolescents was found and supports the routine monitoring of risk of self-injurious thinking and behavior in this at-risk population.

AB  - Summary A yearling Irish Cob stallion was presented to De Morette Equine clinic for severe acute abdominal pain, nonresponsive to analgesics and sedatives. Rectal palpation and a limited transabdominal ultrasonographic examination led to the presumptive diagnosis of a strangulated obstruction of the small intestine. The painful behaviour of the pony did not allow conservative treatment and surgical exploration was denied by the owners for financial considerations. On necropsy, a large cystic mature teratoma was adhered to the ventral body wall, the mesenteric root, omentum and intestines. Teratomas are rare in man and animals, and an extragonadal intraperitoneal location has not previously been reported in the equine species.

AB  - Abstract A study of the differences in the psychosocial effects of mastectomy versus segmentectomy was done on a group of women who were in a prospective randomized protocol for treatment of primary breast cancer. Through questionnaires designed for this study and standardized psychologic tests, women with segmentectomies responded as significantly less anxious, less sad, and more in control of their life events than women with mastectomies. The women with segmentectomies had a statistically more positive sexual and body image than those with mastectomies. The trauma of viewing the surgery was much greater in patients with mastectomies. The concern about cancer recurrence was less in the segmentectomy group. The differences in psychosexual adaptation to mastectomy or segmentectomy and the fears of cancer recurrence were significantly better in the segmentectomy group. The adequacies of cancer therapy was the same for both groups in the national study. This study restresses the importance of the segmentectomy option for women with breast cancer in leading to a better quality of life.

AB  - Chronic pain is a widely recognised problem in humans and is being increasingly recognised as a significant problem in dogs. Whilst a large number of therapies are described and utilised to treat chronic pain in dogs, there is a severe shortage of evidence to guide practitioners in selection of treatments. Until more evidence becomes available, practitioners should adopt a cautious approach, utilising licensed treatments first when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies should be incorporated into the chronic pain management plan whenever possible. Given the probable prevalence of chronic pain in dogs there is an urgent need for research to identify effective treatments.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Background and Objectives Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a relatively rare skin tumor. Clinical observations indicated that DFSP has a more aggressive behavior during pregnancy, which suggest there might be a hormonal influence on this tumor. We evaluated the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in DFSP patients. Methods In our present case series, patients with histopathological-confirmed DFSP at a single institution were identified. The clinical, pathological, and immunohistochemical data were gathered for each patient. Expression of ER and PR were determined on formalin-fixed,?paraffin-embedded tissue sections using immunohistochemistry. Some objective clinical and pathological indicators were then selected to compare between ER and PR status. Results Immunoreactivity revealed none of these tumors stained positively for ER, while eight tumors (28.6%) stained positively for PR. There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of tumor location between the PR-positive/negative groups. Conclusions This finding suggests that progesterone may have potential effects in growth of DFSPs. Further studies are needed to fully address this question.

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Background Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (EAF) is a benign rare lesion of the upper respiratory mucosa. EAF most commonly presents with an obstructive nasal mass. Due to the rarity of EAF, case reports and case studies have predominated the literature. This systematic review discusses the demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, management, and outcomes of this uncommon entity. Methods The PubMed database was searched for all articles describing patients diagnosed with sinonasal EAF. Additional cases were examined from the bibliographies of selected articles. Demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, radiography, management, and outcome were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases were included from 34 articles, including 1 case from our institution. The most common presenting symptom was nasal obstruction (78.8%). Fourteen patients (26.9%) had a previous history of nasal surgery or trauma. Surgical resection alone was the most commonly used primary treatment approach (50.0%), resulting in the greatest proportion of disease-free patients (55.6%) over a median follow-up period of 36 months. A combination of surgery and corticosteroids was the second-most-common treatment modality, used in 28.8% of cases. Of the 40 cases reporting patient outcomes, 100% of patients were alive at follow-up independent of treatment modality. Conclusion To date, this review contains the largest number of patients with sinonasal EAF. Aggressive surgical resection alone constitutes the most common treatment modality and may be most effective at eradicating disease.
