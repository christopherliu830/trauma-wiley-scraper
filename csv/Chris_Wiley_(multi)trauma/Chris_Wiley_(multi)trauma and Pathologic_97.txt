AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Changes in subchondral bone density, induced by the repetitive cyclical loading of exercise, may potentiate fatigue damage and the risk of fracture. Objectives To use computed tomography (CT) to characterise bone density patterns at the articular surface of the third metacarpal bone in racehorses with and without lateral condylar fractures. Study Design Case control Methods Computed tomographic images of the distal articulating surface of the third metacarpal bone were obtained from Thoroughbred racehorses subjected to euthanasia in the UK. Third metacarpal bones were divided into 3 groups based on lateral condyle status; fractured (FX, n = 42), nonfractured contralateral condyle (NFX, n = 42) and control condyles from horses subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelated to the third metacarpal bone (control, n = 94). Colour CT images were generated whereby each colour represented a range of pixel values and thus a relative range of bone density. A density value was calculated qualitatively by estimating the percentage of each colour within a specific region. Subchondral bone density was assessed in 6 regions from dorsal to palmar and 1 mm medial and lateral to the centre of the lateral parasagittal groove in NFX and control condyles and 1 mm medial and lateral to the fracture in FX condyles. Results Bone density was significantly higher in the FX and NFX condyles compared with control condyles for all 6 regions. A significantly higher bone density was observed in FX condyles relative to NFX condyles in the lateral middle and lateral palmar regions. Fractured condyles had increased heterogeneity in density among the 6 regions of interest compared with control and NFX condyles. Conclusions Adjacent to the fracture, a focal increase in bone density and increased heterogeneity of density were characteristic of limbs with lateral condylar fractures compared with control and NFX condyles. These differences may represent pathological changes in bone density that increase the risk for lateral condylar fractures in racehorses.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteochondrosis is an ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage that results in focal failure of endochondral ossification and osteochondritis dissecans at specific sites in the epiphyses of humans and animals, including horses. The upstream events leading to the focal ischemia remain unknown. The epiphyseal growth cartilage matrix is composed of proteoglycan and collagen macromolecules and encases its vascular tree in canals. The matrix undergoes major dynamic changes in early life that could weaken it biomechanically and predispose it to focal trauma and vascular failure. Subregions in neonatal foal femoral epiphyses (n?=?10 osteochondrosis predisposed; n?=?6 control) were assessed for proteoglycan and collagen structure/content employing 3T quantitative MRI (3T qMRI: T1? and T2 maps). Site-matched validations were made with histology, immunohistochemistry, and second-harmonic microscopy. Growth cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation times were significantly increased (p?<?0.002) within the proximal third of the trochlea, a site predisposed to osteochondrosis, when compared with other regions. However, this was observed in both control and osteochondrosis predisposed specimens. Microscopic evaluation of this region revealed an expansive area with low proteoglycan content and a hypertrophic-like appearance on second-harmonic microscopy. We speculate that this matrix structure and composition, though physiological, may weaken the epiphyseal growth cartilage biomechanically in focal regions and could enhance the risk of vascular failure with trauma leading to osteochondrosis. However, additional investigations are now required to confirm this. 3T qMRI will be useful for future non-invasive longitudinal studies to track the osteochondrosis disease trajectory in animals and humans. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Several studies have repeatedly demonstrated that leukoaraiosis as well as ventricular enlargement are common findings in normal elderly and in stroke patients, although there is no general consensus on prevalence rate as well as on their clinical correlations. It is also controversial whether white matter changes and ventricular enlargement are reciprocally related. In this study we investigated the prevalence and extent of white matter hyperintensities and the degree of ventricular enlargement on magnetic resonance imaging in 50 normal elderly individuals (mean age 62.1 ± 7.3 years) and in 50 consecutive chronic ischemic stroke patients (mean age 66.1 ± 7.7 years). All subjects underwent extensive clinical assessment. White matter hyperintensities were graded from 0 to 3 on a semi-quantitative scale, while bifrontal horn, bicaudate, and third ventricle ratio indices were used as measures of brain atrophy. Hypertension, diabetes, alcohol consumption, cardiac disease, carotid pathology occurred significantly more often in patients than in controls. Prevalence rates of white matter hyperintensities were 30% in controls and 82% in patients. Patients had significantly larger ventricular indices than controls. Significant univariate correlations for the extent of white matter hyperintensities were found with age, sex, hypertension, cardiac disease, carotid pathology, diabetes, history of stroke and ventricular enlargement. Age, sex, cardiac disease, alcohol habit, cerebrovascular disease and extent of white matter hyperintensities correlated with severity of ventricular enlargement. Multivariate regression analysis identified age, hypertension and history of stroke as independent predictors of white matter hyperintensities, while history of stroke, age and alcohol consumption were found as the only independent predictors of ventricular enlargement Separate analysis between periventricular, subcortical or deep white matter hyperintensities and each of the three ventricular indices failed to show a significant association after adjustment for clinical and demographic factors. We suggest that leukoaraiosis and ventricular enlargement are independent pathological processes associated with different risk factors in addition to age and stroke disease.

AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Abstract Spasticity is a disorder of the sensorimotor systme characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone with exagerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. It is one component of the upper motoneruon syndrome, along with released flexor reflexes, weakness, and loss of dexterity. Spasticity is an important ?positive? diagnostic sign of the upper motoneuron syndrome, and when it restricts motion, disability may result. The ?negative? signs--weakness and loss of dexterity--invariably alter patient function when they occur. In an upper motoneuron syndrome, the alpha motoneuron pool becomes hyperexcitable at the segmental level. This hyperexcitability is hypothesized to occur through a variety of mechanisms, not all of which have yet been demonstrated in humans. Spasticity caused by spinal cord lesions is often marked by a slow increase in excitation and overactivity of both flexors and extensors with reactions possibly occurring many segments away from the stimulus. Cerebral lesions often cause rapid build-up of excitation with a bias toward involvement of antigravity muscles. Chronic spasticity can lead to changes in the rheologic properties of the involved and neighboring muscles. Stiffness, contracture, atrophy, and fibrosis may interact with pathologic regulatory mechanisms to prevent normal control of limb position and movement. In the clinical exam, it is important to distinguish between the resistance due to spasticity and that due to rheologic changes, because the distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic nerve or motor point blocks and dynamic or multichannel EMG are useful to distinguish the contributions of spasticity and stiffness to the clinical problem. 1997 John Wiley  20 (suppl 6):S1-S13.

AB  - This retrospective study of 143 pediatric patients with unilateral acute scrotal disease was done to assess the value of duplex Doppler sonographic examination prior to puberty (110 patients) in comparison to a pubertal group (33 patients) in a pediatric hospital, where the examinations are done by staff radiologists and radiology residents of varying degrees of expertise and experience with Doppler technique. All patients seen during an 18 month period were included. The unaffected side was examined in most patients and served as control. The normal Doppler shift in the center of the prepubertal testis was found to be 0.2 to 0.5 kHz, when using a 5 MHz duplex Doppler probe. With puberty, the Doppler shift increased to 0.5 to 1 kHz. Of 18 patients (10 prepubertal) with testicular torsion, five (three prepubertal) had false-positive Doppler shift. In four of these five cases, faulty placement of the Doppler sample volume cursor was probably the cause. Using a multi-way frequency analysis, puberty was found to have no significant influence on results of Doppler signal (chi square = 0.1346; P = 0.7137). Duplex Doppler sonographic examination is as useful to rule out testicular torsion in prepubertal boys as it is after puberty. Meticulous technique is essential. The opposite side should be examined first and serves as control for the affected one. Results showing no flow in the center of the diseased testis with positive flow in the unaffected one should lead to further clinical action (scintigraphy or surgery).

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Abstract Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common and often devastating birth defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a malformation complex. Considerable progress is being made in the identification of genetic causes of CDH. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of ?1Mb resolution to 29 CDH patients with prior normal karyotypes who had been recruited into our multi-site study. One patient, clinically diagnosed with Fryns syndrome, demonstrated a de novo 5Mb deletion at chromosome region 1q41?q42.12 that was confirmed by FISH. Given prior reports of CDH in association with cytogenetic abnormalities in this region, we propose that this represents a locus for Fryns syndrome, a Fryns syndrome phenocopy, or CDH. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of nine canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) pathogens in asymptomatic dogs presented at animal shelters across the United States. METHODS Ocular and oronasal swabs from asymptomatic dogs (n = 503) were tested using qPCR assay for Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus. RESULTS A total of 240 (47 · 7%) asymptomatic dogs were PCR-positive for at least one CIRD pathogen. Prevalence of two-, three-, four-, and five-pathogen cases was 12 · 7, 3 · 8, 1 · 8, and 0 · 4%, respectively. Mycoplasma cynos (29 · 2%), B. bronchiseptica (19 · 5%), CAV-2 (12 · 5%), CDV (7 · 4%) and CPIV (3 · 2%) were the most commonly detected pathogens. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The prevalence of traditional and newly emerging pathogens associated with CIRD is poorly defined in clinically healthy dogs. This study determined that a high percentage of asymptomatic shelter dogs harbor CIRD pathogens, including the newly emerging pathogen M. cynos and the historically prevalent pathogen B. bronchiseptica.

AB  - As one of the most important natural materials, cortical bone is a composite material comprising assemblies of tropocollagen molecules and nanoscale hydroxyapatite mineral crystals, forming an extremely tough, yet lightweight, adaptive and multi-functional material. Bone has evolved to provide structural support to organisms, and therefore its mechanical properties are vital physiologically. Like many mineralized tissues, bone can resist deformation and fracture from the nature of its hierarchical structure, which spans molecular to macroscopic length-scales. In fact, bone derives its fracture resistance with a multitude of deformation and toughening mechanisms that are active at most of these dimensions. It is shown that bone's strength and ductility originate primarily at the scale of the nano to submicrometer structure of its mineralized collagen fibrils and fibers, whereas bone toughness is additionally generated at much larger, micro- to near-millimeter, scales from crack-tip shielding associated with interactions between the crack path and the microstructure. It is further shown how the effectiveness with which bone's structural features can resist fracture at small to large length-scales can become degraded by biological factors such as aging and disease, which affect such features as the collagen cross-linking environment, the homogeneity of mineralization, and the density of the osteonal structures.

AB  - Abstract Splenic ectopic pregnancy refers to the implantation of the oosperm in the spleen. If not diagnosed early, the results of this phenomenon would almost certainly be splenic rupture, which is equivalent to the spontaneous rupture of the spleen. If the patient has no history of trauma, it is difficult to diagnose this condition early and an explicit diagnosis is often obtained by exploratory laparotomy. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Under emergency general anesthesia, gynecologist and hepatobiliary surgeons worked together to conduct an exploratory laparotomy. It was confirmed during surgery that this was ectopic pregnancy in the spleen, which caused rupture of the spleen. Hence, splenectomy was conducted. Postoperative recovery was good.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the efficacy of porcine small intestinal submucosa in corneal reconstructive surgery in dogs and cats through a large retrospective study. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 106 cases of surgical reconstruction of the cornea with small intestinal submucosa seen between May 2005 and January 2010 was carried out. The corneal defect was filled by microsurgical grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa. The biomaterial implant was deposited in one or several layers depending on the depth of the defect. The animals were examined 3, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Results: Vision was preserved in all eyes at three months post-surgery. In 74 cases (69.8%) the corneal scar was either transparent or discrete, whilst in 32 cases (30.2%) a mild or marked scar was observed. Minor complications occurred in 9 cases (8.5%) with partial integration of the small intestinal submucosa and in 24 cases (22.6%) with faint or mild corneal pigmentation, without impairing vision. In cases followed over a period longer than three months, major complications occurred in five dogs resulting in vision impairment because of pronounced pigmentation. Clinical Significance: Corneal grafting of porcine small intestinal submucosa is an effective method for corneal reconstruction resulting in corneal transparency in most cases. It is an excellent alternative to conventional conjunctival grafts.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the effect of perioperative and operative variables on survival time in dogs with aortic body tumors. Study Design? Retrospective study. Sample Population? Twenty-four client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed aortic body tumor. Methods? Seventy-eight patient records of dogs seen at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 1989 and 1999 with a diagnosis of a heart-base mass were reviewed. Dogs without histologic conformation of an aortic body tumor were excluded. Age; sex; breed; the presence of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or abdominal effusion; evidence of cardiac arrhythmias; evidence of distant metastasis; treatment with pericardectomy; treatment with chemotherapy; and time from diagnosis until euthanasia or death were recorded on a spreadsheet. Cox proportional-hazard ratios were used to calculate the relationship of risk variables to survival time. Median survival time was determined using life-table analysis. Results? Twenty-four dogs met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The median age of dogs with aortic body tumors was 9 years. All dogs had a surgical biopsy performed. Fourteen dogs had a pericardectomy at the time of the biopsy procedure. Of all factors analyzed, only treatment with pericardectomy had a significant influence on survival (P= .0029). Dogs that had pericardectomy survived longer (median survival, 730 days; range, 1?1,621 days) compared with dogs that did not have pericardectomy (median survival, 42 days; range, 1?180 days). This finding was independent of the presence or absence of pericardial effusion at the time of surgery. Clinical Relevance? Dogs that are diagnosed with aortic body tumors may benefit from a pericardectomy at the time of surgical biopsy.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.
